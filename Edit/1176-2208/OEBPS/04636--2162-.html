  <h1>Chapter 2162 Strategy player</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base. Wang Ming's satellite signal shielding does not end until Monk Jin Deng leaves. Wang Ling needs protection. The monk also needs protection.</p>

    <p>This is the result of Wang Ming's comprehensive consideration of the checks and balances in the modern world of cultivation. It is actually not good to expose one's own strength prematurely.</p>

    <p>After all, a country like Michu has always made money from war since the founding of the Xiuzhen Kingdom. Moreover, it has a deep-rooted hegemonic mentality. It is completely unwilling to see others well...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ming will not miss anyone who should be protected. When monk Jin Deng took over Wang Ling to suppress Zhu? and Xiongwu.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming manipulates the clouds in this area to prevent satellites from directly penetrating the clouds to capture the images below. This method is not only modern technology. At the same time, Wang Ming also uses part of the power of the Heavenly Dao cloud.</p>

    <p>In the past, in order to protect his own people, Wang Ming's methods were limited to the modern cultivation technology developed by relying on his own intelligence. Now, even beings such as the miracles of the universe are using it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming doesn't know whether this kind of progress is good or bad. The variety of means sometimes does not mean stability.</p>

    <p>He had a premonition that the Battle of Destiny might come at a certain time point in the future. And now they should not be far away from this time point.</p>

    <p>Everything depends on Director Wang's arrangements.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Director Wang quickly returned to the Karma Base using the teleportation technique. Zhai Yin had already prepared a new game cabin for him in advance.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling. Everything has been prepared for you."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin laughed: "You don't have to worry about the data. Everything has been saved for you. During your absence, we use an intelligent AI system to imitate your logical thinking when you sign up to perform power leveling operations."</p>

    <p>She found that while she was speaking, Wang Ling was secretly observing the girl's sleeping face through the reinforced glass window of the game cabin.</p>

    <p>"Oh." Wang Ling nodded slightly, looked back, and then lay back in the game cabin.</p>

    <p>It turns out that during his absence, the character remained active... Is there actually a power-leveling mechanism?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say much. Then he lay down directly.</p>

    <p>The Itinerant Immortal method is better than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>He was originally a person who didn't really like playing games, because no matter what game he played, he would eventually complete the game without any difference, and it was as if he had used a cheat.</p>

    <p>But the Itinerant Immortal ring is different.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is still very strong in the game world. So strong that those players who have seen him would rather believe that he is an NPC than Zhenren.</p>

    <p>But the Itinerant Immortal Ring is not a game that he can play alone.</p>

    <p>How to win over the hearts of players in this game world. To unite the players into a single rope, thereby overcoming the difficulties currently faced by most players.</p>

    <p>This is the fun of the game that Wang Ling really feels.</p>

    <p>In other words. Wang Ling feels that he is playing the Itinerant Immortal magic ring now. It is more like a sand table deduction for the future battle of destiny.</p>

    <p>The gray fog arranged by Bai Zhe is gradually making this game world become real.</p>

    <p>In addition to facing this difficulty, Wang Ling has not forgotten the original purpose of him and Sun Rong entering the game. It was to assist Mr. Zanghu in completing his big plan to break the wall of spiritual consciousness.</p>

    <p>This is the key.</p>

    <p>But it's obvious. This time's big plan is far more difficult than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>During the time when Wang Ling was temporarily away from the game. Sun Rong and Lao Huang were still carrying out city construction work according to the original plan.</p>

    <p>Currently, there are many Wolongs in Fuyun Town. After Xiongwu came to challenge them, Fuyun Town, which was originally not rich in surrounding resources, has become the most popular gathering place for newbies among players.</p>

    <p>And thanks to the sense of security brought by Wang Ling, the crime rate around Fuyun Town is also the lowest. No matter people or monsters, high-level players dare not bully easily. As for robbery, they can't even think about it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the players who came here were very open-minded. After seeing many demon spirits who were working and being assigned by Fuyun Town to transport materials, they actually helped escort the materials to build the town.</p>

    <p>"It's really strange. No one would attack these monsters carrying supplies. At first, I thought that if too many monsters became our coolies, the happiness index of the residents would drop." Sun Rong looked at the data generated by the system. Sand table. Smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>"It's normal. Most players still fancy our NPPC from Fuyun Town, who is so unbelievable."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang analyzed: "They know that these monsters are arranged by the general. Naturally, they will not take action. If they do, it may reduce the general's favorability towards these people."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "So they help with rhyme supplies. Are they also increasing their favorability?"</p>

    <p>"Apparently so."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang nodded: "Although in the world of Itinerant Immortal, the more powerful the NPC, the harder it is to increase the favorability. But if you can increase the favorability to a certain level, you may be able to unlock additional hidden rewards."</p>

    <p>"You have to know. There are some players who play Itinerant Immortal. They don't take the route of killing monsters and upgrading. They take the route of strategy."</p>

    <p>"Strategy...route?"</p>

    <p>"As the name suggests, you can increase your basic favorability by locking certain NPCs, completing designated tasks, or giving designated gifts. After the basic favorability increases, you can go out on a date together."</p>

    <p>"Can it still be like this?!" Sun Rong was shocked. I didn't expect that such an operation could be done.</p>

    <p>"The strongest one among the current strategy players even married an NPC as his wife in his game world. Not only did he get all the property of that NPC, but he also got good equipment and magic weapons at the same time. It can be said that he is a soft rice in the game world. Hard ceiling."</p>

    <p>"That's a talent..." Sun Rong's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>She felt that this was not something that ordinary people could do. It was really outrageous.</p>

    <p>So, in order to cooperate with Mr. Zanghu's subsequent actions, should she also attack the general of Fuyun Town?</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that she has worked diligently under this general for so long. She should have a good impression, right?</p>

    <p>"Then Lao Huang. How should we judge the favorability?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"You can try to ask if you can ask someone out on a date. If it reaches the point where you can go on a date, then the basic value of favorability is enough. It should be at least 40 or above. Then this is a key node."</p>

    <p>"Because in the process of subsequent dates, the favorability will still fluctuate. Generally speaking, as long as it can reach more than 60 points, you can ask the NPC for something. If the other party agrees to give it to you, you can directly show the specific relationship between you. Favorability value."</p>

    <p>"That's it..." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>The route to conquer the stream was much more difficult than she thought. Because the favorability level was hidden at the beginning. The value would not be displayed directly. www.uukanshu.net In other words, whether you can conquer the NPC still depends on your specific feelings. Certainly.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong is very confused.</p>

    <p>For Mr. Zanghu's big plan, she really wanted to try to capture the general of Fuyun Town... But what if she just went there and let her classmate Wang Ling see it...</p>

    <p>While the girl was thinking wildly, Old Huang suddenly brightened his eyes and said, "In this case, there is no other way. In order for our Fuyun Town to develop better, I decided to go out in person to attack our general!"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong quickly grabbed Lao Huang and said, "Wait a minute, Lao Huang. You are a man!"</p>

    <p>"I know. But this is a game. What does it matter? The only option for increasing the favorability of NPC is to be a couple. You can also be brothers! Of course. If this becomes a couple in the end, it can only be God's will..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong wiped the cold sweat and said: "Don't, Lao Huang... I'd better do it... I'll do it. It's better..."</p>
