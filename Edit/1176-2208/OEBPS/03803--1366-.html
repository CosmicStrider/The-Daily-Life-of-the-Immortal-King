  <h1>Chapter 1366 Sun Rong's trip to the demon world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Friday, December 4th.</p>

    <p>The monk visited Sister Sun's villa again.</p>

    <p>With the "Split Rule" and "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube" provided by Sun Ying'er, the conditions required to make Aohai's Sword Spirit Space a "Super Sword Spirit Container" have been met.</p>

    <p>Now upgrade Aohai. Only monk Jin Deng is required to operate. Basically there will be no big problems.</p>

    <p>"Today I came to see Miss Sun. I want Miss Sun to accompany me to the demon world," the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Going to the demon world?"</p>

    <p>"After upgrading to a super sword spirit container, you need to identify the owner as soon as possible. If you choose it on the earth, it will be too noisy and may attract attention. If you place it in the demon world, it is actually just right." The monk said.</p>

    <p>He actually thought about where to place the upgraded altar for a long time. In the end, he chose the demon world.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, the second generation Demon Saint and the Demon Realm Saint Shen Wuyue are our own people and can provide certain help.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, upgrading the super sword spirit container can once again trigger a chaotic catastrophe...</p>

    <p>The earth has been upgraded. Naturally, the demon world cannot lag behind.</p>

    <p>This is for the sake of checks and balances.</p>

    <p>And the monk felt that this time helping the demon world complete the upgrade would also help improve their relationship with the demon world.</p>

    <p>Mainly the bond with the Office of Strategic Deception will become deeper.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong actually knows very little about the demon world. The only thing we know is that Er Ha is from the demon world.</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong thought about it like this. The expression on his face became surprised again: "This Heavenly Dao is owned by classmate Wang Ling... could it be the same in the demon world?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The monk was no longer surprised by the girl's ancestral strange brain power. "It wasn't Ling Zhenren who opened it. But I guess the second-generation demon saint would be happy to step down and give way to someone new."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling becomes a demon saint in the demon world?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren doesn't have time to worry about so many things." The monk smiled: "Benefactor Ha. He is a ready-made demon saint."</p>

    <p>"Er Ha..." Sun Rong nodded thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, she hasn't seen Er Ha in a while.</p>

    <p>"The earth was upgraded a while ago. Benefactor Ha accidentally swallowed the spirit of a mythical beast. It is currently practicing in seclusion in the demon world. Ling Zhenren secretly provided help. The speed at which it swallows the spirit of mythical beasts has been greatly improved. It will be completed in the near future."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Miss Sun is going with the poor monk this time. You can learn about the scenery of the demon world. By the way, you can also visit Benefactor Ha."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I listen to my seniors." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>The monk is very powerful. She believes that there will be no problem with her safety.</p>

    <p>Plus, Ying'er is always with her.</p>

    <p>If you encounter a situation that you can't beat... Wang Ying will also come.</p>

    <p>Although in terms of personality, Wang Ying and Wang Ling are very different.</p>

    <p>But as a shadow, Wang Ying has very well inherited one of the characteristics of Wang Ling - peeking at the screen.</p>

    <p>Maybe there is something wrong in what I said.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong feels that there shouldn't be much problem with his analysis...</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng. How long will we have to go?" Sun Rong asked before leaving.</p>

    <p>"Soon. You can come back the same day you go." The monk replied.</p>

    <p>Making a super sword spirit container is not difficult for him.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had notified the demon world in advance about upgrading the altar, so that the second-generation demon saint and Shen Wuyue would be fully prepared.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, please come with me."</p>

    <p>The monk performed a Buddhist ritual. Then he took out a purple gold alms bowl from his "Sleeve Qiankun" and placed it on the ground.</p>

    <p>Then, he took the first step and stepped on the mouth of the alms bowl. His whole body was sucked in instantly.</p>

    <p>This is a map transmission tool commonly used by monks.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little nervous. She had never seen what the demon world was like. However, curiosity still drove the girl to take this step.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Buddha's light transmitted by the purple gold alms bowl is very gentle.</p>

    <p>There wasn't much discomfort.</p>

    <p>When I landed, Sun Rong felt like a leaf floating on the water. I was gently transported to the demon world.</p>

    <p>This is a pretty retro tribal world.</p>

    <p>The girl stands on a high place.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, there is not a particularly modern building in the vast area. Every place is full of ancient simplicity.</p>

    <p>The architectural style of the demon world is completely different from that of the human world. It feels like you are visiting ancient ruins.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, where we are now is the center of the demon world, above the sacred pillar. That is, where the demon saint is." The monk said lightly.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the magnificent retro palace behind him: "That's where the Demon Saint lives."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er chuckled: "Rongrong, do you know? Not everyone is qualified to come to this sacred pillar of the demon world. Even the eight demon gods are not qualified to set foot on the top of the sacred pillar without instructions."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's words are not exaggerated.</p>

    <p>On top of the sacred pillar.</p>

    <p>This is a realm that symbolizes the supreme power of the demon clan and the supreme majesty of the demon saint.</p>

    <p>Even demons and gods are not qualified to come here. But Sun Rong is here.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er found it funny: "Hey! The first time Rongrong came to the demon world, he went to the top of this sacred pillar. I don't know whether to say that Rongrong is indeed the strongest Foundation Building on the earth! Or she is the daughter of a certain order..."</p>

    <p>The woman didn't say a word. Sun Rong blushed and scolded Sun Ying'er: "What did Ying'er say? Stop talking nonsense..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er stuck out her tongue slightly and then shut up obediently.</p>

    <p>They waited outside the temple for about a minute. The second-generation Demon Saint and the Holy Envoy Shen Wuyue hurriedly walked out of the palace to greet them.</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng and Miss Sun have been waiting for a long time." Shen Wuyue took the lead in saying hello, bowing and apologizing.</p>

    <p>He looked at Sun Rong: "I have heard about Miss Sun for a long time. I can see her today. She is indeed extraordinary."</p>

    <p>"Senior, thank you..." This politeness made the girl feel a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"We are all our own people here. Girls Sun Rong don't need to be nervous. Coming here is like returning to your own home."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue smiled: "Miss Sun, are you interested in drinking deer blood soup? It can beautify your skin and prolong your life. This is a great tonic."</p>

    <p>Sun RongDoubt: "Deer blood soup?"</p>

    <p>"That's it." Shen Wuyue said as he pulled off his antlers.</p>

    <p>Chi! A sound!</p>

    <p>Blood instantly spurted out from the fracture like a fountain.</p>

    <p>"Thank you... no... no need..." Sun Rong was frightened.</p>

    <p>"Then please invite Mr. Demon Saint and Miss Sun to come into the palace for a chat." At this time, the second-generation Demon Saint next to him also spoke.</p>

    <p>"Demon Saint?" Sun Rong was suddenly surprised.</p>

    <p>The second-generation demon saint realized that he had let slip his words. The expression on his face also looked slightly embarrassed.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the monk smiled slightly: "To be honest with what Miss Sun said, this poor monk actually served as a demon saint in one of his reincarnations. But that was a long time ago. There was no ranking of demon saints at that time. So, The poor monk is the original demon saint."</p>

    <p>"Senior's experience is really rich..." Sun Rong was shocked and speechless.</p>

    <p>She understood Shen Wuyue's words instantly.</p>

    <p>No wonder it is said that coming here is like returning to your own home.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong I thought it was Shen Wuyue {Jin Ping Mei} (a TV series about a large-scale battery theft) that I had watched too much.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that Jin Deng would have such an experience...</p>
