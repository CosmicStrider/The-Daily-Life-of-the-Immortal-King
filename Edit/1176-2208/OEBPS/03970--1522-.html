  <h1>Chapter 1522 Reason for Rejection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is nothing wrong with being confident. But being overconfident is foolish.</p>

    <p>However, there is a saying that young people in love are mentally retarded. Ma Jiao thinks this sentence is perfectly reflected in Jisaki.</p>

    <p>But in fact, it is normal for straight men like Jisaki to be unable to understand the meaning of girls.</p>

    <p>When a girl who doesn't have any good feelings for you suddenly asks you out for a heart-to-heart talk... it's not that this girl has a mental problem. It's most likely that she just gave you a good person card!</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao seemed to have heard Sun Rong with a smile and said seriously to Jisaki, "You are a good person."</p>

    <p>But looking at Jisaki's smiling face, Ma Jiao felt that Jisaki obviously didn't realize the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>"Do you really like that young lady that much?" At this time, Ma Jiao asked in the Jiudaohe student office.</p>

    <p>Jisaki didn't know. His answer was actually a choice for Ma Jiao to take the next step.</p>

    <p>Jisaki's face was red. The rapidly rising temperature was accompanied by the emitted moisture. The steam caused the clean bangs to blow backwards.</p>

    <p>"Of course..." Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>He felt like he liked it even more than he thought. Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>I have worked so hard to practice for so many years, all for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After Ma Jiao's last reminder, he understood instantly. His feelings for Sun Rong were not caused by "hate."</p>

    <p>But a kind of adoration, like and love...</p>

    <p>He practiced so hard just to catch up with the footsteps of the goddess in his mind.</p>

    <p>Regarding Ma Jiao's question, Jisaki's answer was very honest.</p>

    <p>Even by looking at his expression, you can tell his true feelings for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I see."</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao replied with a low face.</p>

    <p>"Why are you asking this? Classmate Ma Jiao?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not doing anything. I just wish you a long life." Ma Jiao said.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jisaki didn't know that she was sorting out the plan on the notebook in her hand...</p>

    <p>That's a complete plan to kill Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>She felt that Jisaki would be given the good guy card anyway.</p>

    <p>She will definitely feel pain when the time comes. Then it would be better for her to end it all with her own hands.</p>

    <p>Something Jisaki can't get.</p>

    <p>Then it will be completely destroyed...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After lunch that day, Sun Rong hurried to a cafe outside the school.</p>

    <p>Lunch break in Jiudaohe. Students here can go out freely.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong pushed into the private room of the cafe, Jisaki was already waiting here.</p>

    <p>He ordered the cafe's specialty desserts and steaming hand-ground coffee. He was looking forward to the arrival of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, what Sun Rong and Jisaki don't know is that the people next door to their private room are none other than Wang Ming, Zhai Yin and Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Of course, it was not Wang Ling who asked to come. It was Wang Ming and Zhai Yin who forcefully pulled Wang Ling over after they noticed something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sipped the crisp coffee. Staring expressionlessly at the two chattering people in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Brother! Why don't you know how to be anxious..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned: "Ms. Rong is having a coffee date with another man! What do you think is so good about this Jisaki? It's not as simple as pouring a cappuccino for an old aunt... He's clearly interested in Miss Rong! "</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's mouth is like a machine cannon.</p>

    <p>In fact, of course he knew exactly what the purpose of Sun Rong was.</p>

    <p>The reason why I brought Wang Ling over was just to see my brother's reaction.</p>

    <p>The results show that.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't feel any nervousness...</p>

    <p>Sure enough.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>The thing he was most worried about seemed to have happened.</p>

    <p>Is it because Talisman was suppressed for too long?</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling became a person who was completely incapable of emotions.</p>

    <p>Although Talisman has a certain function of sealing emotions, Wang Ming has always ignored a very important point.</p>

    <p>That is if the emotions have been sealed for a long time.</p>

    <p>It is very likely that a force like "inertial thinking" will be formed in the heart and mind.</p>

    <p>The worst result is that a cage-like closure may form in the heart...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned.</p>

    <p>He increasingly felt the importance of developing a new Talisman.</p>

    <p>For the safety of the earth, the safety of the universe. At the same time... also for the happiness of his brother.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head. The coffee ladle was stirring the crispy noodle-based coffee in his hand. The waiters outside glanced in their direction from time to time.</p>

    <p>This coffee shop provides DIY coffee service. The waiter had never seen this kind of drinking method before. He was very surprised.</p>

    <p>Drinking coffee. He has seen ones with immortal grass as the base, taro balls as the base, aloe vera jelly as the base... but he has never seen one with dry noodles as the base.</p>

    <p>Is this stuff really drinkable???</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the private room.</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked at Sun Rong happily. His face was full of happiness and satisfaction: "I don't know. Sun Rong-chan came to see me today. Why? I don't want to say. I am a good person..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong almost choked after hearing these words. However, after being stunned for a moment, Sun Rong still smiled and said, "How does Jisaki-san know?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki's heart suddenly felt like a thunderbolt.</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang. So straightforward..." Jisaki smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"I have something more straightforward." Sun Rong said with a smile: "But actually I don't want to hurt Jisaki-san. Because Jisaki-san is indeed a very good person. He is also very hard-working and motivated. But the two of us. inappropriate."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong came here this time just to plan. Break everything into pieces and talk about it.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she was also afraid that she would hurt Jisaki's self-esteem.</p>

    <p>So during the showdown, Jisaki's own feelings were also taken into consideration as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"Although I am disappointed, I am still very touched that Sun Rong-chan can tell me so frankly."</p>

    <p>Jisaki smiled and said: "So. Can we still be friends in the future?"</p>

    <p>"We are friends now." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>That kind of gentle yet generous character made Jisaki feel itchy in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that a boy who could be liked by Sun Rong must have saved the galaxy or the universe in his previous life.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, you won't be able to find such a good girl even if you hold a lantern...</p>

    <p>"Since we are friends, Rong Jiang can call me Ah Jiu from now on. Calling me Jisaki classmate is too foreign."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Ah Brother Jiu."Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>Jisaki is older than her. She knows it.</p>

    <p>In order to get closer, I call him brother. Sun Rong thinks it's not too much.</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang. Can I ask another question?" At this time, Jisaki sighed slightly and asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>"I want to know. Where am I inappropriate? I have to die to understand it!" Jisaki didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was startled. Then he quickly blushed.</p>

    <p>She stared at Jisaki and said seriously: "That's because I already have someone I like... and I want to be with him for the rest of my life!"</p>
