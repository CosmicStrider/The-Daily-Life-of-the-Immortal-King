  <h1>Chapter 1893 Assassination of Wang Lingâ‘¡</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same moment, in Li Xuan's apartment, three royals suddenly saw Crispy Noodles in front of them. Dao Lord suddenly looked in one direction, showing a vigilant look.</p>

    <p>Protecting Wang Muyu was also within the scope of Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's responsibilities. He had a premonition that something was wrong with Wang Muyu, so he showed such a vigilant look.</p>

    <p>However, for the real clone, the safety of the main body is always the first priority. According to the law of primary and secondary, he cannot leave the Wang Ling main body now.</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling has three Eternal Royal Family Protectors around him, he feels that this is still not stable enough.</p>

    <p>"Crispy Noodles Dao Lord... If you have something to do, you can go do it first. We are here." The Skeleton Prince said proactively.</p>

    <p>However, he received a very cold reply from Crispy Noodles Dao Lord: "Even with the three of you here, the safety of the Lord cannot be guaranteed."</p>

    <p>"The three of us are an eternal royal family."</p>

    <p>"I Know."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord nodded with a smile: "But it's still too weak."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, the three Skeleton Princes were heartbroken. They kindly offered to guard here, but in the end, they were poured cold water on them. This was something they never expected.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not that Crispy Noodles Dao Lord looks down on these three eternal royal families. It's a conclusion drawn entirely based on the current situation through repeated comparisons and weighings.</p>

    <p>If the people we are dealing with are just ordinary Eternals, it will definitely be enough to keep three Eternal Royal Family members.</p>

    <p>But if the opponent is a dragon, everything is unknown.</p>

    <p>The reason why Bai Zhe was not killed before was also within the layout design of Wang Ling. And Crispy Noodles Dao Lord also knew about this plan.</p>

    <p>Now Bai Zhe has become particularly cautious and will not act rashly. But once the opponent launches a large-scale attack, it will definitely be the stage when all the information is revealed.</p>

    <p>The daily harassment seen by Wang Ling is already a small fight. Bai Zhe also knows that Wang Ling cannot be completely destroyed through such means. So now both sides are planning a big game.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe. Waiting for his base to be fully prepared before launching a general attack.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling was waiting for Bai Zhe to be fully prepared to launch a general attack, and then directly attacked them all without leaving any capital for the opponent to make a comeback.</p>

    <p>Analyzing the current situation. It is obvious that Wang Muyu is a very key element in Bai Zhe's overall plan.</p>

    <p>This can be seen from the repeated kidnappings planned by the other party.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling is also waiting for Bai Zhe to launch a general attack, this is not inconsistent with protecting Wang Muyu. Even though he was a little uncomfortable with this sudden arrival of the little guy at first.</p>

    <p>But after getting along for a long time, Wang Ling felt as if he had an extra brother. He began to have a vague feeling that he couldn't let go.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu is so similar to him. Even their preference for eating crispy noodles is exactly the same. It's hard to find a true friend. Based on this alone, Wang Ling cannot let Wang Muyu go.</p>

    <p>So now, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord knew about the battle situation on Wang Muyu's side. Since he couldn't leave, he had no choice but to send a text message to Old Wang's house to ask for help.</p>

    <p>Soon, he received a text message reply. It was a short string of voices. What was displayed using the voice-to-text function was the word "Yiya."</p>

    <p>This is Ah Nuan girl's direct reply through Father Wang's mobile phone.</p>

    <p>Although the little girl is only less than half a year old, she is already very familiar with the use of smart devices. A few days ago, she went shopping online to buy herself a new model of celebrity co-branded diapers.</p>

    <p>When the courier delivered the diapers to their home, Wang Nuan also signed for them in person. She wrote the word "Nuan" directly on the courier box with her foot. The courier was shocked to see it.</p>

    <p>He said in his heart that the development of today's children is too advanced. It made him feel a little frustrated!</p>

    <p>He couldn't even sit up when he was half a year old... This little girl can actually shop online and sign for express delivery by herself. It's outrageous!</p>

    <p>"It's a message from Crispy Noodles. It says something happened at the Sun Family Castle." Father Wang looked at Wang Nuan. The child in front of him was only less than half a year old.</p>

    <p>He actually shouldered the heavy responsibility of saving the world. He felt inexplicably moved for a moment. He picked up Ah Nuan girl and looked at her lovingly: "Ah Nuan. Don't push yourself too hard. Isn't it too much?"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan shook her head at the speed of light. Although she was only half a year old, she already understood the principle that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is extremely fond of her. As a younger sister, she can feel this directly. Because of this, now her brother is in trouble. As a younger sister, she naturally wants to help.</p>

    <p>But once she leaves, the safety of Father Wang and Mother Wang will no longer be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>So before officially leaving, Wang Nuan left her shadow behind and hid it under the sofa at Old Wang's house.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The dragon's breath fills the sky. Huge dragon shadows cross the sky. Dozens of thunder dragons are entrenched in the high sky. Dark clouds cover the city, showing a tendency of collapse.</p>

    <p>This is Jingze's core world power. Wang Muyu knows it very well. He has fallen into another "cage" of Jingze. But this is also of Wang Muyu's own free will.</p>

    <p>Because it's better than hurting innocent people.</p>

    <p>Jingze, on the other hand, fulfilled his promise and did not attack innocent people. He only targeted him.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu knew that this was a kind of arrogance stemming from Jingze as a dragon descendant of the dragon clan. Wang Muyu still had a little hope for Jingze. He believed that this electric dragon had a sense of justice. It was just being used.</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the core world, Jingze is the master and god of this world. He will have more powerful oppression.</p>

    <p>If you want to convince such a god with your mouth, Wang Muyu feels that the difficulty level is quite high.</p>

    <p>"Can I just beat you down?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu sighed in his heart. As Jingze said, he has not yet developed into a complete body. However, he has improved a lot during this period.</p>

    <p>Although he has never tried what it feels like to fight against the pressure of the core world. But he feels that since his father Wang Ling can ignore the power of other people's core world, he can do it too!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Just for an instant. The seven-color glazed dragon's breath surrounded his body. Dragons of different colors of elements lingered around his body. The colorful phantom dragon wings opened at this moment, carrying a kind of light. In a trance, he looked like a beautiful splash-ink ink painting which shows the charm of an ancient dragon.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu grew up. The dragon's breath in his body was purer than when he was born. And such an astonishing growth rate shocked Jingze.</p>

    <p>Even though he was silent on the surface, Wang Muyu's growth ability suddenly made him realize why Bai Zhe tried so hard to get Wang Muyu back.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he understood everything.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Muyu is the hope for the revival of the Dragon Clan!</p>

    <p>This is the hope for the dragon clan to become the overlord of the universe again!</p>
