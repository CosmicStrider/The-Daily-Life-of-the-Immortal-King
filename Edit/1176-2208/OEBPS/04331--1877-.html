  <h1>Chapter 1877 The gradually deviating script</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Among the Trade Central Star. King Tiankun is actually astonishing. His power alone caused the black clouds above the temple to overwhelm the city. There was a magical force that completely obscured the sky above the entire temple. No light could penetrate.</p>

    <p>The two snake girls who were following him were far away from each other. They were afraid that they would be affected. They not only hid far away, but also put several layers of spiritual shields on themselves.</p>

    <p>They did not participate in the battle. They just kept encouraging King Tiankun from behind: "Come on, Your Majesty! Kill this gangster in Room 1! Get the Book of Nine Realms back! There is a statue of Emperor Xi in the temple. He is an old man. We are watching!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Snake Girl Number 2 followed closely and encouraged: "Your Majesty, come on! These people are mediocre in strength. They will definitely not be able to defeat you! You have been on the battlefield for a long time. How can you be afraid of these guys!"</p>

    <p>After hearing this, King Tiankun sneered heavily. He stood proudly in the void, full of momentum, as if he didn't notice the people below.</p>

    <p>At this time, all the believers in the temple were fleeing and scattered. King Tiankun watched these people flee in all directions without making any move to stop them.</p>

    <p>His target was obvious. He was here for the Dongda group. As for the other believers in the temple, they were not his target and he had no such interest.</p>

    <p>But this is on the Trade Central Star. From the past until now, few people dare to do it directly here.</p>

    <p>There was a strange movement in the ancient city. As the alliance army, the guards of the ancient city in the central galaxy could not ignore it. Immediately, there were dozens of guards with spiritual swords on their feet. They appeared densely on the other side of the sky like meteors.</p>

    <p>They saw that the person standing there was King Tiankun. The expressions on everyone's faces changed accordingly. This was the representative of the Western Emperor. He had superior combat power. Now he chose to take action here. The guards of the ancient city instantly looked very... passive.</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty, this is not the place to do anything."</p>

    <p>A captain of the ancient city guard stood up and talked to King Tiankun with cold sweat on his head. He was under great pressure and felt awe-inspiring. This King Tiankun was worthy of being the representative of the Western Emperor, a battle-hardened big shot. Just standing in front of him one can feel that terrifying sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Seeing that King Tiankun was silent, his Adam's apple rolled involuntarily. Then he said: "If the prince can activate the core world operations, we will leave immediately."</p>

    <p>This is the current approach of the ancient city guards to retreat in order to advance. It is their duty to mediate conflicts and wars in the central galaxy.</p>

    <p>However, the person they were facing was King Tiankun. He was a very difficult figure. The ancient city guards knew that they were powerless to stop him. They could only retreat to the next best thing. They hoped that King Tiankun would use the core world to fight.</p>

    <p>But how can King Tiankun care about this? He doesn't take these ancient city guards seriously at all: "Then my core world will be a mess? I will fight here! Don't worry. I won't cause any trouble to you. I will take action with my own discretion. I won't cause any big damage here."</p>

    <p>When the guards of the ancient city heard this, they couldn't help but look at each other. They hesitated to speak. Even with King Tiankun's guarantee, most of them still seemed very hesitant.</p>

    <p>The battles between Soul Formation realms are all city destroyers. Not to mention a strong ancestral realm like King Tiankun. If the ancestral realm is overtaken, it will not only destroy the world, but also a serious planet. Great war!</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Everyone, since King Tiankun wants to compete with me, then I have no reason to refuse. Don't worry, I won't let King Tiankun wreak havoc here."</p>

    <p>At this time, Emperor Dongda said with a kind smile: "If it is damaged, the idol of Emperor Xi is here. You can ask Emperor Xi for the cost of repairs. I believe Emperor Xi is wise and powerful. He will pay for it. On his account."</p>

    <p>At this moment, a powerful spiritual energy rushed up like a flame and was released from the body of Emperor Dongda. This was just the most common fire spell. It was not the magical power of the Suzaku method, but it was already terrifying.</p>

    <p>This is because Emperor Dongda did not want to reveal his true identity directly and deliberately hid it. The role he is playing now is that of a royal family from the Eastern Region. Therefore, having fire spells on his body will not make people feel abrupt or strange.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun had already seen that the guest in Room 1 was not an ordinary person. But the intensity of the psychic energy still made his eyes jump slightly.</p>

    <p>The two people's breaths collided at this moment. The scene immediately became impossible to end. Those ancient city guards in the sky simply could not bear such a breath collision. Being caught in the middle made them extremely embarrassed. They had to be forced to fall from the air. Responsible for dispersing the crowd and building a barrier around them.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Shanxiu. It's very dangerous here!" An ancient city guard came to Mrs. Shanxiu and tried to take Mrs. Shanxiu away.</p>

    <p>However, Mrs. Shanxiu just smiled slightly: "It's okay. I'm right here."</p>

    <p>Immediately she glanced at Sun Fu, Chen Ren and Guo Jie beside her: "These three young people are also protected by me. There will be no accidents. You go and drive away the other loose cultivators first. Their safety is more important."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu's expression was calm. It was an unexpected calmness. Looking at Sun Rong, Zhang Zhui and Wang Zhen were both a little dazed.</p>

    <p>They were certain that Mrs. Shanxiu had definitely not traveled from modern times. But her calm attitude, as if she already knew the identity of Wang Ling, made several people feel very confused at the same time.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>King Tiankun pressed forward with his palm. Immediately there was a roaring sound from the Dao. He moved very quickly, like a dragon exploring the sea. It brought out a blazing light that shattered the surrounding space. The flash of dark purple lightning was extremely frightening.</p>

    <p>This is the magical power of the Western Region's "The Romance of Dragons and Snakes." King Tiankun has cultivated to the tenth level. It's just one palm. It shows different changes with terrifying speed. Like a snake, like a dragon. Earth-shaking. Intertwined together. Together with the blazing fire emanating from the Eastern Emperor, they formed a dazzling two-level pattern of yin and yang.</p>

    <p>One yin and one yang. One is like a devil coming to the world. The other is like a flying golden crow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hides in Dongda's body and secretly observes everything. He has never directly helped Dongda take action. Everything he sees now is all Dongda's own power.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that he is worthy of being a strong man with the appearance of an emperor. He just stood there with his hands behind his back. With unusual stability,</p>

    <p>As Emperor Dongda said before, he was facing just a prince. How could an emperor like him be afraid of a mere prince?</p>

    <p>So, he stood there and wrapped his palms with fire. Then he clenched his fist fiercely and blasted out towards King Tiankun in front of him!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Huge and blazing fire burst out from Dongda's fist. Like a fire dragon, it rushed straight towards King Tiankun's body. Dongda's blow was devastating. It exploded with astonishing power and blasted towards Kun Tianwai and then straight into the sky. Forming an amazing pillar of fire that is invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>The next scene was unexpected by everyone present. Including Emperor Dongda himself, they all felt shocked.</p>

    <p>Because Emperor Dongda didn't think of it at all.</p>

    <p>His punch.</p>

    <p>He actually beat King Tiankun to death...</p>

    <p>And this. This is something that was not written at all in the diary!</p>
