  <h1>Chapter 1891 The story of another timeline</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wednesday, January 7th.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong did not return all night. They also did not report to school the next day. At this time, they attracted the attention of the two adults.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was so anxious about his granddaughter. She disappeared without any reason.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that in Sun Yiyuan's cognition, Sun Rong has been extremely obedient and well-behaved since she was a child. She will never disappear for no reason. But now that people are missing, Sun Yiyuan begins to have a full sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>The incident of the Shadow Stream Killer last year was still vivid in his mind. It seemed like it was yesterday. His heart was in a mess at the moment and he didn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>He called Zhuo Yi and found that Zhuo Yi was also missing. After going through a lot of connections, he finally found Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun. My granddaughter. You have to tell me the truth. You really don't know where she went..." Office of Strategic Deception. Sun Yiyuan was at Lord Diulei's desk with his hands behind his back. He was pacing back and forth. He was sweating profusely. This was because he was frightened. Because of the ancestral brain-magic gene, he thought of many terrible things.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, old man. I have sent people to search for her. Of course Miss Sun is safe and sound." Lord Diulei comforted him.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was also an insider on this matter. How could he, a sect leader, transfer so many core members of the Office of Strategic Deception and not know what they were doing?</p>

    <p>As for not returning home all night, Lord Diulei's judgment was that maybe they had encountered some trouble. So last night he called Wang Ling overnight. He found that Wang Ling's phone number could not be reached either.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Lord Diulei's judgment is that Wang Ling must be with this group of people and are performing the same task.</p>

    <p>So there is Wang Ling here. Then there is no need to panic...</p>

    <p>It's only a matter of time before those troubles are solved. They just need to be patient and wait for them to proactively reply to messages.</p>

    <p>"Do you have any basis for what you say, Zhenjun? My Rongrong can't even reach the Golden Core! She is a cultivator in the Foundation Building period. In this huge world, accidents are too easy to happen! What if she is bullied... Or rather..."</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Yiyuan thought of something more terrifying, Lord Diulei quickly interrupted and stopped him: "Master, don't think too much..."</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. Boss Sun doesn't know the true combat power of Sun Rong. Therefore, many things cannot be explained clearly.</p>

    <p>During the Foundation Building period... were bullied?</p>

    <p>Of course it doesn't exist for her...</p>

    <p>Your granddaughter is being protected by Ling Zhenren. It's good if she doesn't bully others.</p>

    <p>This is truly the first Foundation Building phase on earth!</p>

    <p>The memory of Lord Diulei, watching her chop off the Old God of the Protoss with one sword, is still vivid in his mind.</p>

    <p>And the nine-core Aohai hadn't yet reached the point of being a nine-core Aohai. The current Aohai has nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes integrated into the sword body... It's like a god blocking a god and a Buddha blocking a Buddha.</p>

    <p>However, he had already expected Boss Sun to do this when he answered the phone earlier. Therefore, he had already thought of a way to comfort him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei fiddled with it and took out something from his sleeve. It was a Talisman that contained huge spiritual power. Sun Yiyuan's eyes immediately lit up: "This is..."</p>

    <p>"Death Talisman." Lord Diulei said. In fact, these are the surplus ones that Wang Ling asked the two brothers Heavenly Dao to make last time.</p>

    <p>But now, he used it as an excuse to comfort people. He said: "This was something I got by chance. I wanted to give it to Miss Sun, but Miss Sun refused to accept it. So I thought of something Fazi secretly bound Miss Sun. In other words, the owner of this death talisman is Miss Sun Rong. The death talisman has not yet taken effect. This proves that Miss Sun is definitely still safe. We only need to expand the search. Just wait for a reply."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Yiyuan finally breathed a sigh of relief: "That's good... that's good..."</p>

    <p>The tense thoughts in his heart eased. He even forgot to ask about the true origin of this death talisman.</p>

    <p>After all, there is no one in this world who can draw such a Talisman.</p>

    <p>It was almost impossible to find it. He looked at Sun Yiyuan's relieved expression and felt a little mixed in his heart. He raised his head and looked at the sky at this time. He felt that the Crispy Noodles Dao Lord he had sent out before. There is already news from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As a real clone, although all thoughts and consciousness are completely independent, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord still has the ability to sense the original body. So he easily found the apartment where Li Xuan lived. The security guard roughly guessed the origin of some things.</p>

    <p>Because this entire apartment building is now owned by the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Therefore, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's first judgment is that Wang Ling and Sun Rong must be investigating this Li Xuan matter. I just came here. And I must have discovered something in the apartment building.</p>

    <p>Choosing a small hidden corner near the apartment building, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord amplified his spiritual awareness. With his amazing sensing ability, he accurately found the location of Wang Ling with a teleportation method.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, the three eternal royals who were quietly guarding Wang Ling, the Skeleton Prince, the Lion-Headed Man and Meng Liuli, were all shocked.</p>

    <p>After a moment of awkward hurriedness, Meng Liuli looked at Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, who looked similar to Wang Ling, and asked with a look of realization: "Are you... Ling Zhenren's clone? No. It looks more like It's the real clone."</p>

    <p>As a member of the eternal royal family, Meng Liuli still has some knowledge. Seeing that these three people are concentrating on protecting Wang Ling, Lord Crispy Noodles Dao also relaxed a little bit of his vigilance.</p>

    <p>He could tell that these three people did not mean any harm. Otherwise, they would have taken action the moment he landed.</p>

    <p>"I understand. You must be anxious because you can't find Ling Zhenren, right? Don't worry. Ling Zhenren is fine. He just followed the path of the mysterious text and entered the world where the mysterious text is." The lion-headed man was rough. came the voice. They are really serious. They work extremely hard to guard Wang Ling. They abide by their responsibilities as guards.</p>

    <p>This look of working hard made Crispy Noodles Dao Lord laugh a little. But now the whereabouts of Wang Ling was finally found. This made him breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>He immediately took out his cell phone and planned to report back. The text message was sent in bulk. It was sent to Lord Diulei, Father Wang and Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"We found Ling Ling. I knew this kid would be fine." Father Wang looked at his phone and said.</p>

    <p>"Then what's the answer from the school teacher?" Mother Wang didn't know whether to laugh or cry: "This kid doesn't know how to say anything if he doesn't come back at night. Even if he is guarding world peace, he at least needs to send a text message."</p>

    <p>"He must have run into some trouble. I couldn't calculate the time. But it doesn't matter." Father Wang said, "If there is any problem, our Ah Nuan can go to support at any time."</p>

    <p>"Eaaah!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Nuan has put on diapers by herself. She looks ready to go.</p>
