  <h1>Chapter 1854 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng's concerns are not unreasonable. After all, even Wang Ling has issued a warning. He is unwilling to let others get involved in too many things.</p>

    <p>However, the person who knows the Eternal One best is the Eternal One after all. Although Wang Ling is invincible in the universe, it is still difficult to clarify some historical secrets and the complexity of the Eternal One in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>Eternal affairs are like a complex problem. Even though there are thousands of ways to solve it, there is often only one way to the truth.</p>

    <p>After calming down, Monk Jin Deng finally slowly closed his eyes. After a few seconds, when his eyelids reopened, two shining "swastikas" appeared in his pupils.</p>

    <p>"Let me, poor monk, take a look at the doorway inside." Monk Jin Deng said in a steady voice.</p>

    <p>This is an eternal mysterious text that he has never seen before. There may be certain risks in peeking into it. Perhaps he predicted that his direct probing might cause damage to his eyeballs. He directly wrapped two balls of past Buddha fire in the swastika. Go up. Penetrate the pupil force into it.</p>

    <p>No one knew what would happen after Monk Jin Deng's temptation. Everyone stared at the monk intently. Li Xian, Zhang Zhui, Qin Zhong, and Xiang Yi sat down together around Monk Jin Deng in a circle. These are the four most powerful people here. They form a human spirit formation to protect the others.</p>

    <p>"Is there any danger?" The atmosphere at the scene was far more tense than Sun Rong imagined. In the end, even her breathing became noticeably faster.</p>

    <p>"I...I'll do the fortune telling." You Yueqing was also very nervous. She hurriedly took out the turtle shell, half-closed her eyes, and then entered a state of meditation.</p>

    <p>When the ancient coins inside the turtle shell made a crisp collision sound, the ancient coins fell from the gap at the bottom of the turtle shell.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>Standing firmly on the floor.</p>

    <p>"It's an unknown hexagram. The danger is unknown." A surprised look appeared on You Yueqing's face.</p>

    <p>She has never encountered such an ancient coin standing upright on the floor after falling from the turtle shell. The probability of this is extremely slim.</p>

    <p>In other words, she could not predict anything about Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen?" You Yueqing frowned slightly, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>In order to eliminate the possibility of coincidence, she stuffed the ancient coins back into the turtle shell and entered an ethereal and peaceful state again, trying to perform fortune telling again.</p>

    <p>"Go..."</p>

    <p>The second time, the ancient coin fell from the turtle shell. After shaking for a few times, it stood upright on the floor.</p>

    <p>"Standing up again..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also looked at the ancient coin that looked like a straight man of steel. At the same time, he was lost in thought.</p>

    <p>Once was a coincidence. Both times they stood on the floor. The probability is too low...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help sweating on her forehead. The water here is too deep. Maybe they just can't control it!</p>

    <p>Such a hexagram has never been seen before. Even You Yueqing did not expect that it would appear twice in succession.</p>

    <p>So here we go again. What kind of hexagram is the scariest?</p>

    <p>If it were those hexagrams that were very bad, You Yueqing would actually think it was fine.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is always those hexagrams full of unknowns that are the most terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the villa of Wen Immortal Garden, with Monk Jin Deng as the center, a powerful wave came from the monk's body, setting off a powerful psychic wave. At the same time, the monk's swastika was also bleeding. Tears of blood continued to flow from the corners of his eyes.</p>

    <p>Obviously, in the process of infiltrating the mysterious text, Swastika has already shown a high load. And it has become an overwhelming situation.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen, and Liu Qingyi responded quickly. The remaining four people immediately surrounded Sun Rong and You Yueqing to form another human formation. First, protect the safety of the two.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin, on the other hand, was holding a kitchen knife in his hand, as if he was ready to sacrifice his own blood at any time... He, like Er Ha, has entered the ranks of mythical beasts. In addition, he has the unique healing ability of the Silver Wild Horse clan. Xiao Yin's blood is almost a natural healing elixir.</p>

    <p>The reaction of this psychic wave was too high, making everyone here think that there might be a big explosion in Lord Diulei's villa.</p>

    <p>At this moment, monk Jin Deng's temples had veins popping out. He clasped his hands together and shouted angrily. He even forcibly suppressed the spiritual energy wave.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Is this suppressed?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "It seems to be under control. But I feel that something is wrong."</p>

    <p>The remaining people came forward to take a look. They found Monk Jin Deng and the four people who were protecting Monk Jin Deng, Zhang Zhui, Li Xian, Xiang Yi, and Qin Zhong. Everyone seemed to have lost their connection. Their heads were lowered and their eyes were closed. Although they could feel their even breathing, no matter how much Zhuo Yi shouted, there was no response at all.</p>

    <p>"The situation is not good. They may have fallen into this mysterious world." Gu Shunzhi shouted in a deep voice. He expressed his thoughts almost immediately.</p>

    <p>"Can this still be an immersive experience?"</p>

    <p>"After all, this is a mysterious text that even senior Jin Deng has never seen. It is not surprising to have such power."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi frowned: "In such a state, it is difficult to wake them up using normal methods. Moreover, they have entered an unknown world."</p>

    <p>"It is currently uncertain if in a soul penetration state, if they are in danger in that world, they may also suffer heavy losses."</p>

    <p>"On the other hand, if they don't follow the script recorded in the mysterious text, it may change the trajectory of the existing world!"</p>

    <p>After the analysis, Sun Rong knew immediately that this was a big deal. She felt extremely regretful. She regretted that she should not have listened to Wang Ling and forcefully intervened in this matter.</p>

    <p>She was immersed in the scene for about ten seconds. Faced with the situation in front of her, the rest of the people didn't know how to deal with it.</p>

    <p>"Is it true that I can't wake you up? Do you want me to give a slap?" Wang Zhen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. In fact, he didn't know whether he could do this. But he couldn't think of any other way at the moment.</p>

    <p>He stepped forward without saying a word and directly chose Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>"Did Senior Zhang blame Brother Wang Zhen?" Sun Rong asked weakly.</p>

    <p>"Not really. I just heard that he had a dark history of stealing people before, so I was a little unhappy." Wang Zhen answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>"..." The rest of the people.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do. A dead horse is treated as a living horse." Wang Zhen, an expert in art, was bold. As a result, he slapped Zhang Zhui on the face. His whole body instantly felt as if he had been electrocuted. His whole body began to twitch.</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen! Be careful!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi looked anxious and rushed forward.</p>

    <p>"Don't go. Danger!"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing had quick eyesight and quick hands. She immediately took action to pull Liu Qingyi back.</p>

    <p>"Sister Qingyi! Taoist Priest You!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also reacted very quickly. She immediately released Aohai's sword energy. She tried to simulate the sword energy into a long whip to draw the person back.</p>

    <p>"Master's wife. It's dangerous!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is secretly speaking something bad. They are also rushing to save people.</p>

    <p>But in the end, it was still a step too late. Along with his last heart-rending cry.</p>

    <p>The remaining four people, in the form of gourd dolls saving grandpa, connected to Zhang Zhui's body, and entered the world outlined in the mysterious text together...</p>
