  <h1>Chapter 1717 I wish. Life can live up to all those who want to live hard...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Poverty alleviation work in the cultivation world has always been a long and arduous task. There are also many volunteers among the teachers who have participated in poverty alleviation work. For example, Lao Gudong is one of them.</p>

    <p>Due to the exclusive teleportation array setup, as long as you obtain a volunteer certificate, you can easily use the teleportation array to travel from one city to another. Then use the sword to reach the area that needs help.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong has the habit of going to remote areas to teach on a voluntary basis every weekend.</p>

    <p>On this day, he carried a box of strawberries with cream to the home of the student he was helping. The simple house was crumbling in the wind, as if it would fall down at any time.</p>

    <p>He knows that there are too many people hiding in corners in the world who are stubborn and refuse to ask for help but are in desperate need of help. But it is impossible for him to save them all by himself. So now he can only do one thing: One point. Use your own actions to infect more people.</p>

    <p>I only hope that life can live up to all those who want to live hard.</p>

    <p>After finishing everything he had done, Lao Gudong sighed with emotion.</p>

    <p>If possible, he hopes that one day, everyone can have endless strawberries every day...</p>

    <p>After leaving the student's humble home, Lao Gudong used several reinforced Talisman to coat the crumbling house with a layer of film. He was not ready to leave until the repair work was completed.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to take advantage of his sword and walk away, there was a loud roar in the clear sky. A silver spear struck down and turned into an electric ball that landed precisely in front of him.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong reacted very quickly. He took a quick step back almost subconsciously. As a famous epic killer in the killer world, his sword is still young and his reactions are extremely sensitive.</p>

    <p>He took a step back and threw a few silver needles in his hand, aiming at the vital parts. He could feel that the other party was evil and had murderous intent, so he didn't have any worries when he took action.</p>

    <p>However, these needles stopped in the air before they could get close to the visitor. There was an electromagnetic force barrier that stopped these flying needles.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong calmed down and stared at Yan? and Jingze with vigilant eyes.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" He could tell. These two people were not ordinary.</p>

    <p>"Are you Wang Zukang?"</p>

    <p>Jingze said in a cold voice: "I need you to come with us."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong frowned. He couldn't feel the breath of the two people at such a close distance. This was enough to prove how powerful these two people were. Although they looked young, their combat power might indeed be extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Whether you resist or escape, there will always be risks. And it may affect the students in the house behind you.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the two people were trying to do with him. But in this situation, he seemed to have no choice: "I can leave with you. But... don't hurt the people in the room behind."</p>

    <p>Jingze's face was neither sad nor happy. His voice was cold: "Don't worry. He is not on our list."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Lao Gudong nodded. Then he felt a change in front of his eyes. It seemed that he was swallowed by a force into another space.</p>

    <p>When he opened his eyes, he was already in a cell inside the core world of Jingze. What surprised him even more was that Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Su Xiao, Li Youyue and others were also captured...</p>

    <p>"Teacher! Why are you here too!" Everyone was surprised when they saw Lao Gudong was also brought in.</p>

    <p>"These two people are very strong and I can't deal with them. If they resist stubbornly, I'm afraid they will only die." Lao Gudong frowned.</p>

    <p>"He caught us all together. What was the purpose? Is it for blackmail? Are we all hostages?" At this time, Su Xiao asked.</p>

    <p>"Probably." Lao Gudong nodded.</p>

    <p>He has never met Jingze and Yan?, and he has never remembered his sins against them. But he was caught here. Therefore, the only possibility is that all the people caught here have a common intersection. And their ultimate goal is probably to use them as a threat.</p>

    <p>It's just that Lao Gudong still hasn't figured out who this intersection is...</p>

    <p>After coming to this conclusion, in the cell, a group of people were thinking.</p>

    <p>"This intersection partner should be from our class..." Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"That's not right. Since I'm in your class, why are you capturing me?" Li Youyue was confused.</p>

    <p>"Among the people you know in our class, the person you have the best relationship with is your classmate Sun Rong." Su Xiao said.</p>

    <p>"So we were captured to blackmail Rongrong?" Li Youyue guessed.</p>

    <p>Everyone was puzzled. At this moment, Chen Chao suddenly thought of something. He suddenly raised his head and looked at Li Youyue: "Wait a minute! You are in our class. In addition to knowing a few of us and Besides classmate Sun Rong, you should know someone else, right? And last time, we just went to the ancient street together..."</p>

    <p>"You said Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was even more unbelievable: "No way... Classmate Wang Ling... isn't his family poor? Moreover, he is also a harmless mascot. They captured us to threaten him... what are these robbers are thinking? My classmate Wang Ling doesn't have anything to give them. Could it be that they just want noodles?"</p>

    <p>Obviously the current situation is not the time to joke. But when Guo Hao heard this, he still couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Then we are in a terrible situation. Let's talk about it... If this is really the case, I think Wang Ling will give up on us directly and choose crispy noodles instead."</p>

    <p>"+1..." Su Xiao silently raised her hand and agreed with Guo Hao's answer.</p>

    <p>"In short, everyone, please stay calm and wait and see what happens. Don't worry, the teacher will definitely protect your safety." Lao Gudong said seriously.</p>

    <p>Although it is indeed a bit incredible to reason about this matter at present.</p>

    <p>But as the conclusion is drawn now, the most likely reason why they were caught here may be because of Wang Ling or Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>All along. As the teacher of Wang Ling, Lao Gudong has been vaguely aware of it. He feels that Wang Ling is hiding something...</p>

    <p>But the two people outside just now were both beings with astonishing combat power. He chose not to resist because he judged that it was impossible for him to escape. He just waited and waited to see what would happen.</p>

    <p>If the purpose of capturing them was to threaten Wang Ling into restraining himself...</p>

    <p>So what is the true strength of Wang Ling? This is really an intriguing question.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Lao Gudong was captured, Teacher Pan was soon captured too...</p>

    <p>All people related to Wang Ling. No one escaped.</p>

    <p>Jingze and Yan's methods are clean and neat.</p>

    <p>Soon, only the last one was left on their list. A special person named Wang Nuan...</p>

    <p>"This is it."</p>

    <p>At the entrance of the Wang family's small villa, the two men appeared here again accompanied by a flash of lightning.</p>
