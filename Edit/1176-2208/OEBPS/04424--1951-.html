  <h1>Chapter 1951 Crazy temptation for Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The three choices spread out in front of him made Wang Ling fall into silence. Now he completely understood what Li Changzhe meant by the "selective reward" he had said to him before.</p>

    <p>Three options. He had to make a choice. Although the reward for choice Number 3 did look very tempting, Wang Ling knew clearly that this was actually a test for him by Teng Luchen.</p>

    <p>This is the choice before entering Trial Ground Number 2. Facing an unknown trial. A normal person would definitely choose a partner to go with him for stability.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that all rewards obtained in this trial can be taken back!</p>

    <p>And a prudent choice can not only get help from partners, but also get a high-grade spiritual weapon for free, leaving sufficient guarantee for the unknown trials that follow.</p>

    <p>If you ignore the first two options, Wang Ling directly chooses to go alone. Following Teng Luchen's logic, Wang Ling feels that he is very likely to be trapped.</p>

    <p>That Teng Laobao wanted to observe whether he dared to go on the road alone.</p>

    <p>He stared at choice number three, feeling itchy in his heart. At the same time, he was confused about which of the first two choices should be better.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, Wang Ling found that his left and right hands were being held by Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe at the same time: "Wang Ling. Let's hit the road together!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, when the voices of Li Changzhe and Qu Shuling came in unison.</p>

    <p>In front of the surveillance screen, Teng Luchen's expression twitched: "What's going on... I didn't just open the choice to this classmate Wang! Why did this classmate Li and classmate Zhang also receive the choice at the same time? Question?"</p>

    <p>"This system is newly developed by Teng Lao. It was put into use directly without testing. There may be a bug... According to Teng Lao, do you want to temporarily take the selection system offline. Let us check it carefully." A staff member from the research laboratory asked.</p>

    <p>"Troubleshooting? It's too late. The day lilies are cold. That's all. Just continue to arrange multiple-choice questions to make things difficult for this classmate Wang."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen said: "By the way. If you don't make a choice in time, how will you deal with it?"</p>

    <p>Staff: "Generally, a choice needs to be made within 30 seconds. If there is no choice, it will be regarded as giving up the reward. If there is no choice for more than three times, it will be regarded as a negative game. At that time, the mission will be declared failed and eliminated."</p>

    <p>"So classmate Wang has wasted an opportunity?"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't count... because now the other two students have chosen him. The system directly determines that he chose both options Number 1 and Number 2 at the same time. And he got two high-grade spiritual weapons."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teng Luchen and Jing Heqiu wiped their sweat at the same time. They never expected that the plot would develop in this way.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen felt that he was clearly the one who arranged the script. Why did he feel like he was being arranged by Wang Ling in turn?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually didn't expect that he was so popular. He was grabbed by two people at the same time.</p>

    <p>Then there was nothing more. What was originally a single-person mission turned into a three-person mission in an instant.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan each held Wang Ling's arm. Then they were teleported to an open space on a dilapidated mountain peak.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that they were all put into rough linen clothes belonging to the sect on this mountain peak.</p>

    <p>"Interesting. It seems that the Number 2 trial site is scripted. The three of us have become disciples of the Haoren Sect." Li Changzhe laughed. He pointed at the two huge "Hao Ren" on the back of Zhang Linyan's linen clothes and said .</p>

    <p>"It's so ugly."</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan complained. It happened to be heard by a senior brother here.</p>

    <p>The young man with the mark "Elder Brother of the Haoren Sect" on his head immediately frowned: "What are you still doing? Why don't you hurry up and get ready on the futon! Wait for the leader to come to hold the morning meeting!"</p>

    <p>"She didn't mean it. Senior brother, don't blame her." Li Changzhe bowed. He was very playful. It really seemed like he had completely taken on the role.</p>

    <p>"That's good.</p>

    <p>Today's morning meeting is very important. You must listen carefully." After the explanation, the senior brother Haoren Peak finished his explanation and sat in the center of the first row. Wang Ling and others knew it well. This trial There is no countdown. I'm afraid you have to follow the prompts of the following NPCs to perform specific tasks.</p>

    <p>At this time, the first ray of sunshine in the morning fell on the melodious mountain peak. The misty fog swept away in an instant, shrouding this Haoren Peak in a warm spiritual light.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a looming cloud appeared on the Haoren Peak.</p>

    <p>An immortal old man with wind and bone came riding on the clouds.</p>

    <p>With something ethereal and a bit mysterious, it landed in the open space next to the Bamboo Forest Villa on Haoren Peak. Facing the crowd of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After he appeared, he made a precise ****. He stuck his butt to his futon with great skill.</p>

    <p>Then he started singing:</p>

    <p>The Haoren Sect on the Haoren Peak. The path of immortality is impermanent and requires hard work.</p>

    <p>Accumulating good deeds and cultivating immortal virtues will make the Tao and Dharma empty.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the decree of King Hunyuan Wuji Immortal, he will bless the world of cultivation for generations to come.</p>

    <p>All disciples need to remember that no matter when and where, everyone must not forget these four immortal Wang Zhen's words.</p>

    <p>These are the four sentences that King Immortal personally gave to my Haoren Peak Haoren Sect back then. No other sect has such treatment...</p>

    <p>"Master. Has our sect really produced an immortal king?"</p>

    <p>A pure and pleasant-looking female disciple raised her hand. Her name was Su Qiaoer. She had only been in the sect for a short period of time. It had only been a year. She was not particularly familiar with the "corporate culture" of the Haoren Sect.</p>

    <p>Over the past year, she has been practicing with her fellow disciples. She has been repeating this morning practice session day after day. Listening to these four familiar immortal Wang Zhen sayings, she feels like her delicate ears are getting calluses.</p>

    <p>She had been holding this question in her mind for a long time. Today she finally summoned the courage to ask the headmaster of the Haoren Sect.</p>

    <p>The old headmaster's surname is Hao. His single name has the character for sword.</p>

    <p>In response to this question, the old master of the Haoren Sect stroked his long beard and replied calmly: "Qiaoer's question is good. The immortal king is the highest level in the world of cultivation today. If you become an immortal king, you can become the world and integrate with the universe. As one body. No different from gods... And the reason why my Haoren Sect received four mantras from the immortal king is not because there was an immortal king."</p>

    <p>"What's that for?"</p>

    <p>All the disciples couldn't help but show curious eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ahem. It's because the first headmaster of Haoren Sect and the Immortal King are Taoist companions."</p>

    <p>The old headmaster cleared his throat, shook his fly whisk and replied: "It's a pity. Since the modernization of cultivation, the tall buildings that have been rising up around us have destroyed the spiritual feng shui around our Haoren Peak. The Haoren Sect originally occupied the The spiritual energy around the place that is conducive to first-class cultivation is getting weaker and weaker..."</p>

    <p>It was a rare occasion for the old head master to talk about the history of the sect with everyone. Su Qiaoer sat on the futon. Her fair face looked like she was thinking hard. She seemed to be trying hard to understand the sect's past: "Then head master, why don't we Change place?"</p>

    <p>"Haoren Peak, the Haoren Sect has been established for more than a thousand years. We must not abandon it easily. Although our Haoren Peak is incompatible with the surrounding sects, at least it is within this Donghuang City. It is just a little bit off location..."</p>

    <p>The old leader laughed uncontrollably: "But don't worry, everyone. Although the Haoren Sect is located in the 10th Ring Road of Donghuang City, the 10th Ring Road also has the advantages of the 10th Ring Road. At least it is quiet and comfortable. And it is outside the 10th Ring Road. I The Haoren Sect also has a certain right to speak."</p>

    <p>"As long as everyone remembers the four mantras of the Immortal King. Practice hard. Practice day and night. Sooner or later, you will be successful in practice. Practice the Foundation Building, form the Golden Core, condense the Nascent Soul, and then become immortal."</p>

    <p>"If you can touch the Immortal King's Avenue, it will be the glory that will shine on the lintel of the world of cultivation for thousands of generations..."</p>

    <p>"Then, Master, what is your current level?"</p>

    <p>"Ahem... Practitioners don't tell lies. My teacher is still a few hundred million points away from Nascent Soul. It should be not far away."</p>

    <p>A little bit?</p>

    <p>All said so.</p>

    <p>It seems like it can't be fake.</p>

    <p>He is worthy of being a master teacher!</p>

    <p>When the disciples heard this, they suddenly regained some confidence in the Haoren Sect.</p>

    <p>"Let's not talk about this anymore. As usual, we will enter the last step."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the old headmaster shook his fly whisk. After a burst of dense immortal light appeared, a simple eight-immortal altar suddenly came into view like magic.</p>

    <p>This eight-immortal table was taken out by Master Hao from the space magic weapon.</p>

    <p>On the table is a wooden tablet plated with gold powder and written with the words "The Immortal King of Hunyuan Wuji." There is an incense burner in the center. On the left and right sides are some immortal fruits such as spiritual peaches and jade apples.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is a portrait behind the wooden tablet.</p>

    <p>It is said that this is a portrait of the Immortal King. However, the disciples could only see the clothes of the Immortal King. They could not see clearly the specific appearance of the legendary Immortal King.</p>

    <p>Because the appearance of the immortal king is a mosaic.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe frowned and said using the team voice technique: "This portrait is full of mana. I can't see through it at all. It's very strong!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan nodded and said: "Yes. Me too! I can't see through it at all. Our spiritual power is still too low! Wang Ling What about you? Can you see it?"</p>

    <p>Just a moment. Three options appeared in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>[Choice 1: Tell everyone what the mosaic is. I can see it clearly. Mission reward: One Golden Core of Humanity.]</p>

    <p>[Option 2: Echo that what you see is also a mosaic. Mission reward: a random privilege card.]</p>

    <p>[Choice 3: Tell everyone. I am the immortal king! Mission reward: One Heavenly DaoGolden Core. Three random privilege cards.]</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
