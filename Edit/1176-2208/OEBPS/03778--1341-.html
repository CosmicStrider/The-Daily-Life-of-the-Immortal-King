  <h1>Chapter 1341 The price of disobedience</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Boss Sun found out that the person Sun Rong liked was Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>For the first time, he had the urge to crash into tofu.</p>

    <p>Although love can transcend age...</p>

    <p>But the span is too big. It can easily reach the waist!</p>

    <p>At the tender age of 16, how did Rong Rong fall in love with the head of the Office of Strategic Deception?</p>

    <p>He thinks young people are too impulsive.</p>

    <p>At this time, the elderly at home must come out as a calming agent to calm down the head in love again.</p>

    <p>Of course, the old man strongly opposed this marriage. In fact, there is another very important reason, that is, someone entrusted him to be a matchmaker for Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>What should I do now?</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun himself doesn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception and Huaguo Shuilian Group are currently also partners.</p>

    <p>Even if you can't become a grandson-in-law, you are still a friend.</p>

    <p>At least in terms of wording. He needs to pay extra attention.</p>

    <p>You can no longer just throw money at someone's face like you usually do with ordinary people. Then ask: "How much money do you need to leave my precious granddaughter?"</p>

    <p>That kind of picture was applied to Lord Diulei. Sun Yiyuan felt that he couldn't figure it out and was out of place.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is.</p>

    <p>This matter is of great importance!</p>

    <p>It also concerns the reputation of his precious granddaughter...</p>

    <p>Never let others know.</p>

    <p>He can only negotiate privately in person.</p>

    <p>With a frown on his face, Boss Sun's cell phone rang.</p>

    <p>It's Lord Diulei calling...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei received a text message from Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>For the first time, he had the urge to kill himself on broccoli.</p>

    <p>Isn't my USB flash drive used to complete Miss Sun's memory?</p>

    <p>Why did he suddenly become opposed to his marriage to Miss Sun?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Lord Diulei shivered.</p>

    <p>I almost couldn't even hold my phone steady...</p>

    <p>Don't say that Mr. Boss Sun is opposed to this marriage.</p>

    <p>Even if he carries eighty sedans to ask him to be the son-in-law of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have the guts either!</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>How did this misunderstanding arise...</p>

    <p>After being greeted by this text message from Boss Sun, Lord Diulei couldn't sleep now.</p>

    <p>He felt that he must explain clearly as soon as possible before it caused a big problem.</p>

    <p>After dialing Boss Sun's cell phone, Lord Diulei looked aggrieved.</p>

    <p>As soon as the phone was picked up, Mr. Boss Sun's first words were: "Zhenjun! You finally called! It's okay! You can slowly raise the conditions... We can all discuss it. As long as you don't be with Rongrong."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't laugh or cry: "I actually didn't want to be with Miss Sun..."</p>

    <p>"Could it be that, Zhenjun, you still want to ride on a few more boats?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath: "Mr. Sun, calm down! I think there may be a misunderstanding about this matter!"</p>

    <p>"What misunderstanding? My granddaughter's heart beat faster after receiving the USB flash drive from your Office of Strategic Deception! The doctor said that Rongrong is in love. So I think there must be some confession video recorded in it, right?"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun didn't watch the video?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't look at it. This is Rongrong's."</p>

    <p>"But Miss Sun received more than just my USB flash drive... Why did Mr. Sun think that she would like me?"</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was stunned when he heard these words.</p>

    <p>Then very quickly. Boss Sun was suddenly startled: "Maybe! Rongrong likes this guy Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "</p>

    <p>Have to...</p>

    <p>This is completely missing the point!</p>

    <p>Compared to Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi actually made Boss Sun even more unacceptable.</p>

    <p>There is no other reason. Mainly because I don't like the hairstyle.</p>

    <p>Every time Mr. Boss Sun sees Zhuo Yi's curly hair, he has the urge to cut it off...</p>

    <p>Helpless. Lord Diulei had no choice but to remind her more deeply: "Boss Mr. Sun, do you still remember that not long ago... Miss Sun actually confessed her love?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun was confused: "Rongrong confessed his love? When did it happen?"</p>

    <p>As soon as the words came out.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei noticed that something was wrong with the whole thing. At that time, the incident of Sun Rong confessing to Wang Ling caused a sensation on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Although it was quickly suppressed afterwards, it stands to reason that Mr. Boss Sun's memory cannot completely forget it.</p>

    <p>Could it be that the effects of the "physical amnesia" caused by the death of the Heavenly Dao brothers, combined with the "5% directional global amnesia" effect caused by excessive force... directly caused Mr. Boss Sun to intermittently have "sequelae." The effect of causing amnesia Be strengthened. Forget things that should not be forgotten?</p>

    <p>After much thought, Lord Diulei felt that this was the only explanation that was the most reasonable.</p>

    <p>If there is no such thing as your brother in Boss Sun's current memory.</p>

    <p>My current act of sending a USB flash drive may indeed arouse suspicion...</p>

    <p>Now, since Sun Yiyuan no longer remembers Sun Rong's confession.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that if he mentioned it again, he might make the whole incident more complicated.</p>

    <p>He took a deep breath and explained clearly: "Mr. Sun, you misunderstood. I can be 100% sure. The person Miss Sun likes is not me. Nor is I the one who gave the gift this time. Anyone... Sun The guy the girl likes is at Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that he could only remind him so much.</p>

    <p>The best thing left is to wait for Mr. Boss Sun to calm down and recall it.</p>

    <p>"Then...I'm really sorry, Zhen-kun. I bothered you so late."</p>

    <p>Now it was Boss Sun who felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>He believed what Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>The dignified head of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>When faced with such a personal issue, you would never lie to him.</p>

    <p>After hanging up the phone, Mr. Boss Sun also touched his chin and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Did Rongrong confess to someone before?</p>

    <p>This is a big deal!</p>

    <p>There's no way he doesn't remember...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was calling Jiang Xiaoche to ask about the situation.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, a sweet female voice suddenly sounded in his ears: "His name is Wang Ling--"</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" Sun Yiyuan stood up in shock.</p>

    <p>However, the room was empty. No one appeared.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun didn't notice.</p>

    <p>Right in the blind spot of his sight.</p>

    <p>There was a figure. It quickly spread out from the gap...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, the expression on Sun Ying'er's face looked a little excited.</p>

    <p>It turns out that taking revenge on Wang Ying is such a happy thing!</p>

    <p>Ha! I want her to delete the information in the cloud disk. Isn't it because she doesn't want Sun Rong to know Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>She just did the opposite!</p>

    <p>Here. After reminding Boss Sun, Sun Ying'er quickly came to Sun Rong's room.</p>

    <p>She did not reveal her true form, but instead used the form of a shadow to whisper in the girl's ear: "Cloud--Disk--Small--Note--Book--"</p>

    <p>However, she just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>A more domineering shadow quietly appeared behind her.</p>

    <p>"Um?"</p>

    <p>The familiar voice made Sun Ying'er's whole body stand up.</p>

    <p>"I...I didn't mean it...really!" She tried to be cute.</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's shadow was dragged out completely by Wang Ying...</p>
