  <h1>Chapter 1937 Office of Strategic Deception Level 1 Alert</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was already suspected by Teng Luchen. Wang Ming and Zhai Yin shared it almost immediately.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ming had already previewed this matter with Zhai Yin to prepare for the development of this matter.</p>

    <p>Currently, the only people who know the true strength of Wang Ling are those who are related by blood. The remaining people are Zhai Yin, Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi, Jiugong Liangzi, Zhou Ziyi, Gu Shunzhi, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>Most of the remaining core members of the Office of Strategic Deception, such as Lord Diulei, Zhenyuan Immortal, etc. are actually still half-brained cognitions.</p>

    <p>In their instinctive knowledge, they did not think that Wang Ling was just a sixteen-year-old boy.</p>

    <p>But a thousand-year-old monster who is experiencing the daily life of a high school student...</p>

    <p>But fortunately, as one of the few close friends in Wang Ling's cultivation world, Lord Diulei will still cooperate with Zhuo Yi very tacitly even if he is in such a half-brained state.</p>

    <p>His emotional intelligence is very high, and his temper is very suitable for Wang Ling. This is one of the main reasons why Wang Ling initially supported the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>However, Teng Luchen has doubts about Wang Ling. It is obviously inappropriate to be the first to inform such half-brained core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Extraordinary times call for extraordinary people.</p>

    <p>Now. Inside, Sun Rong uses the power of Gray Cult to cover Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Externally, a two-pronged approach may be needed at the same time.</p>

    <p>In this case, Zhuo Yi needs to coordinate the work.</p>

    <p>"Master. What's wrong? You look solemn?"</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception training ground. Zhuo Yi is here to guide Zhou Ziyi in spiritual sword practice. After receiving the news from Zhai Yin, Zhou Ziyi saw Zhuo Yi frowning and asked quickly.</p>

    <p>"Something went wrong. Your master may have been suspected by a senior." Zhuo Yi did not hide it and said directly to Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>Under his training these days, Zhou Ziyi's newly grown legs and body coordination have made great progress. They are no different from normal people. He has passed the test in walking, running and jumping.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I think it's a miracle that Master has only been suspected until now..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi looked at Zhuo Yi dumbfounded and said, "Who is doubting Master?"</p>

    <p>"A senior named Teng. Everyone calls him Teng Lao."</p>

    <p>"Is he also called Teng Luchen?"</p>

    <p>"You know him?"</p>

    <p>"The owner of Jiutian Tea House. And he also knows me. In fact, Mr. Teng is a good person. He is very concerned about the development of young people in the world of cultivation today. When I broke my leg, he even came to our house to see me with tea leaves." Zhou Zi Yi said.</p>

    <p>"But you also know your master's situation. It's true that he is very strong. But not everyone likes to be shrouded in light."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed: "Live a quiet life. This is also a kind of practice... Such a spirit. You and I will not be able to understand it for a while."</p>

    <p>"Indeed."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi nodded.</p>

    <p>He knew that he would never be able to reach such heights as Wang Ling in his lifetime.</p>

    <p>However, Zhou Ziyi also has his own way of cultivation. And he found that his way of cultivation is very similar to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>That is the great chivalrous person who serves the country and the people.</p>

    <p>This was also the reason why he admired Zhuo Yi infinitely and became his disciple.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi imagined that if he also had great strength, maybe he would take the completely opposite route from his master Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For example, take the common people as your own responsibility and become a benchmark for cultivators in the world.</p>

    <p>As a benchmark, it is impossible to follow the path of low-key hermitage... By then all the wealth, fame and fortune will follow.</p>

    <p>If you want to wear a crown, you must bear its weight.</p>

    <p>How can we not forget our original intention and maintain our true nature under these infinite auras? Zhou Ziyi feels that this is the path he needs to explore in the future.</p>

    <p>Although they follow different paths of cultivation, Zhou Ziyi does not feel that there is an antagonistic relationship between him, Zhuo Yi, and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The nature of the world is that light and shadow follow each other.</p>

    <p>Some people want to be the shadow. Some people want to be the light.</p>

    <p>Where there is light, there is shadow. No one can leave the other.</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao is very powerful. It's not easy to fool him. Of course, I don't have much contact with Teng Lao. It's just an intuition. Master must handle this matter carefully..."</p>

    <p>After thinking for a long time, Zhou Ziyi said: "I can handle the training alone. Master is in trouble now. You'd better solve Master's problem first."</p>

    <p>"On the internal side, your Master's wife is already helping secretly. But the external side still needs to be solved."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "The command center of Jiutian Jingyuan was hijacked by a group of criminals. Teng Lao was being held hostage by the criminals to control the system. The trial field deviated from the originally set script. More powerful spiritual beasts were scheduled to attack that A group of high school students participating in the trial."</p>

    <p>"hijack?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi asked curiously: "No way... Teng Lao should be very strong. Can they beat Teng Lao?"</p>

    <p>Soon, his eyes lit up. Without waiting for Zhuo Yi's reply, he said, "Oh! I understand! Mr. Teng did this on purpose... He wanted to see how Master would react! That's why he arranged this!"</p>

    <p>I can only say that Zhou Ziyi is indeed Zhou Ziyi. He is indeed extremely smart. He can tell the truth in just one point.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is very satisfied with this analysis: "You continue. If I want to solve it externally now. If it were you, what would you do?"</p>

    <p>"Since Mr. Teng deliberately refrained from taking action because he wanted to test our master, then we should force Mr. Teng to take action. And not only must we force Mr. Teng to take action, we ourselves must also send people to rescue him."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi smiled and said: "Teng Lao's identity is not simple. There is a reasonable reason for us to send people to rescue Teng Lao. And Teng Lao is in Songhai City, right? Doesn't he also happen to exercise power in the Office of Strategic Deception? I remember that Huaxiu Alliance originally signed a long-term security outsourcing agreement with the Office of Strategic Deception..."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. You are so smart, Ziyi. You almost think the same thing as me."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help laughing: "The training will continue later. I will send a message to Zhenjun now. Let him take action immediately. And he must be on the highest level of alert. To show that The Office of Strategic Deception takes this matter seriously."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later. The Office of Strategic Deception sect headquarters is located in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>In the Zhengyang Square in front of the True Venerated Immortal Hall. Accompanied by the Hongmeng horns arranged on hundreds of peaks by the entire sect, they sounded like the roar of ancient mythical beasts.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, each peak sent a total of 6,000 Golden Core and above Office of Strategic Deception disciples to gather in the square.</p>

    <p>Two hundred elders of various peaks with Nascent Soul stage and above formed a team in the sky with magic weapons on their feet.</p>

    <p>This is the first wave of rapid response troops after the Office of Strategic Deception entered the first level of alert. The Office of Strategic Deception has been practiced several times before. However, no one expected that it would be put to use so quickly.</p>

    <p>"It's the Hongmeng's voice... The elder wants us to return to our clan quickly! Captain. What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the sect disciples who were performing sect missions in Songhai City also raised their heads the moment they heard the Hongmeng.</p>

    <p>"Listen to my orders. Unless you have tasks such as surveillance that you can't let go of! Others who can return to the clan! Follow me and return to the clan immediately! There is a tough battle to be fought!"</p>
