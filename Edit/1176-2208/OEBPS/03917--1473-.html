  <h1>Chapter 1473 Just draw cards</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Previously, Jiang Xiaoche witnessed everything that happened when Ah Wei and others went to the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>It's just that he didn't know what happened inside the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw Zhuo Yi walking out of the Taoist temple with a girl with very flat breasts. Jiang Xiaoche thought the girl looked familiar, but for a moment he couldn't think of where he had seen her before.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, the three Jiugong family members followed the two of them obediently.</p>

    <p>There was something wrong with their condition. Their faces turned pale, as if they were frightened by something.</p>

    <p>Who is this girl?Zhuo Yi and why are you here...</p>

    <p>So with curiosity, Jiang Xiaoche followed all the way to the door of the Holiday Inn on Gujie. He murmured in his heart: "It turns out I'm not here for Yingying..."</p>

    <p>To be cautious, he did not go in directly. He just noted down where a few people stopped.</p>

    <p>Then turn back to Jiang Yingying's location.</p>

    <p>Now the ancient streets are full of people from the Huaguo Shuilian Group. It is very convenient for him as a secretary-general to inquire about his whereabouts.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Secretary General, that girl is still in my store." The manager of the cold weapon store secretly connected with Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"Why is she still here..." Jiang Xiaoche's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"It will probably take a long time. This girl bought 30 Stone Spear throwing opportunities. We also gave her 30 more times. And then this girl just threw to a distance of 66 meters. Because it is an auspicious number, we gave her 66 more times."</p>

    <p>"How long will it take to vote..." Jiang Xiaoche said with embarrassment, "You won't be able to persuade me?"</p>

    <p>"I tried to persuade him. And the boyfriend who came with him also tried to persuade me. She refused to give up. She said that the eldest lady can throw 5,000 meters. She can do it too. She has to surpass the eldest lady." The store manager said.</p>

    <p>"..." Jiang Xiaoche was shocked after hearing this.</p>

    <p>He and Jiang Yingying pretended to be a couple. Didn't they just come here to cause trouble?</p>

    <p>Why is this little girl still competing with the eldest lady...</p>

    <p>Suddenly Jiang Xiaoche discovered.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Jiang Yingying is quite similar to myself.</p>

    <p>Originally I was going fishing, but as I kept fishing, I became the fish being caught...</p>

    <p>"Calculate for me how long it will take for her to survive."</p>

    <p>"Under normal circumstances, it can be completed within 2 hours."</p>

    <p>"It takes so long?"</p>

    <p>"Because there aren't many Stone Spears in the store. If you throw them out, you have to pick them up again."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the store manager looked at Jiang Yingying's throwing record and sighed: "Miss Jiang is currently on the eighth throw and is resting... But I think it's better for the secretary-general not to get involved in this matter."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Jiang Xiaoche was a little unhappy. He did things by himself and asked an employee to give instructions?</p>

    <p>"Because this is what the eldest lady means."</p>

    <p>The store manager said: "The eldest lady seems to have noticed this stalking girl. So let's find a way to keep her in the store. I can only follow your orders."</p>

    <p>"This stupid girl..."</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Jiang Xiaoche suddenly had a bitter expression on his face.</p>

    <p>At this time, the store manager asked again: "So, does the secretary-general have any questions now? As long as it does not conflict with the tasks assigned by the eldest lady, I can help with other things."</p>

    <p>As an employee of the group, he certainly doesn't want to offend either party.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Jiang Xiaoche had no choice but to say: "Since it is the lady who asked her to stay in the store, I would like you to keep an eye on her. Also, you have to keep an eye on his fake boyfriend for me."</p>

    <p>He had a hunch that something might happen on the ancient street today. It would be safer to let Jiang Yingying stay in the store.</p>

    <p>The Cold Weapon Shop is all our own. I don't expect that the fake boyfriend will do anything strange in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"Secretary-General, please rest assured." The store manager nodded.</p>

    <p>"In addition, you have to replenish her strength. This Stone Spear is very heavy. You must not let her get hurt, you know. If this girl gets hurt, I can't protect you... Even if the old man takes action, the most he can do is push you out. Being cannon fodder..."</p>

    <p>"Does this girl have another identity?" the store manager wondered.</p>

    <p>He looked at Jiang Yingying. He didn't look like a lavish spender...</p>

    <p>Mainly because Jiang Yingying was in the payment process just now. The store manager accidentally glanced at the balance in Jiang Yingying's mobile wallet.</p>

    <p>Including the expenses paid out, the total deposit is only about 80,000. It is far worse than the eldest lady.</p>

    <p>"I'm telling you. But you are not allowed to leak it." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Secretary-General." The store manager nodded.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche took a deep breath and said, "His grandfather is Marshal Jiang...yes. That's the one. Martial Saint."</p>

    <p>Store manager: "..."</p>

    <p>The call was interrupted. Jiang Xiaoche felt a lot more relieved now.</p>

    <p>If someone helps keep an eye on it, he won't need to be so worried.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the store manager now knows Jiang Yingying's identity. There is no need to worry about service attitude.</p>

    <p>However, Jiang Xiaoche still felt that there was something strange about the content of the call just now...</p>

    <p>--etc!</p>

    <p>He remembered that the store manager just said that the eldest lady's Stone Spear threw 5000 meters...</p>

    <p>It's not like Jiang Xiaoche has never played with that stuff before. Under normal circumstances, a Foundation Building period can do this?</p>

    <p>Therefore, if it is not cheating, then the most likely result is that the eldest lady hides her own strength.</p>

    <p>Of course, so far, he has no conclusive evidence.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche discovered that although he came today with the purpose of secretly protecting Jiang Yingying, he seemed to have a lot of unexpected gains...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling walked out of the snack shop satisfied. All the lottery tickets had been consumed.</p>

    <p>Basically, Wang Ling can choose from all the special flavored versions of crispy noodles available in the store on the ancient street, and he drew almost 100 boxes of samples, all of which are special flavored limited editions.</p>

    <p>Because there are not enough in the store, 99 boxes of them will be produced from other places and delivered directly to the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>So now Wang Ling only has one box in hand.</p>

    <p>If it's 20 packs, it can be eaten in the next two days...</p>

    <p>Mainly the taste is different.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't know why. This crispy noodle flagship store seems to have a lot of special flavors. He has never tasted them before.</p>

    <p>"I understand the truth. So what exactly are the roasted silkworm chrysalis-flavored crispy noodles... Are you sure this thing is edible?" Everyone walked out. Guo Hao saw the bag of new noodles in Wang Ling's hand. It tastes like crispy noodles. I immediately felt a strong taste.</p>

    <p>"The roasted silkworm chrysalises are delicious. They are very famous in the winter market. They are full of protein." Li Youyue said with a smile.</p>

    <p>At this time, she saw Wang Ling take out a shiny thing from the dry noodles.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling drew something again..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was surprised.</p>

    <p>After all, snacks like crispy noodles often have activities where cards can be exchanged for prizes. So it is not strange for small cards to appear.</p>

    <p>But this card... is so flashy!</p>

    <p>It's a flash card with golden light!</p>

    <p>Everyone calmed down.</p>

    <p>Then I saw the words engraved by laser on the card: Holiday Inn Ancient Street Presidential Suite Annual Card...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked: "?"</p>

    <p>These days, you get a room card for eating crispy noodles???</p>
