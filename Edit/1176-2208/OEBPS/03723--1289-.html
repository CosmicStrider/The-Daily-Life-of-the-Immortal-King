  <h1>Chapter 1289 Dao God's Will</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Both the martial arts and literary battles ended with the disastrous defeat of the Seven Dao Supremes...</p>

    <p>If you can't beat him, you can still practice slowly. But as a big shot in the God's Domain, it's a bit unreasonable to suffer the disadvantage of being uneducated.</p>

    <p>But the monk knew very well that this matter was not over.</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Supremes are still struggling.</p>

    <p>Because they still have the last hope.</p>

    <p>That is to invite the heads of their seven major families.</p>

    <p>The Wang family, the Gu family and the Liu family. These three family heads definitely cannot be counted on.</p>

    <p>But as long as one of the remaining seven major families can come forward, Zhou Zhentian feels that there is still room for change.</p>

    <p>So while the "literary struggle" is going on.</p>

    <p>The seven Dao Supremes are secretly communicating with the heads of various families who are in retreat.</p>

    <p>I hope someone among them can step in and help them.</p>

    <p>There is no need to kill the monk. As long as the monk can retreat from the difficulty and preserve the interests of the divine domain.</p>

    <p>And faced with such little tricks.</p>

    <p>The monk always smiles.</p>

    <p>His heart is like a mirror.</p>

    <p>Whether it is a civil fight or a military fight.</p>

    <p>Those were all Zhou Zhentian's tricks to delay time.</p>

    <p>"Monk, this is the last wave. If you can withstand Dao God's will, I will no longer interfere in upgrading the earth." As Zhou Zhentian spoke, he flicked his sleeves and laughed wildly.</p>

    <p>Just a second before the wealthy elder of the Zhou family spoke, the head of the Zhou family had already communicated in place.</p>

    <p>They retreated to the side of Daoxuan Hall, intending to watch the show unfold.</p>

    <p>No matter how strong this monk is, can he still be stronger than God?</p>

    <p>They still don't believe it.</p>

    <p>Except for Dao Ancestor Wang in this world, the realm of Dao God can be said to be inferior to one person and superior to ten thousand people!</p>

    <p>Dao God comes. No one can compare!</p>

    <p>"Na na na. It's fine. Why do you want to die?" At this moment, the girl Ajuan who was watching sighed.</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian who stepped aside looked like he was watching a show. He was in a very good mood: "Lord Boundary King, why not persuade the master to leave quickly. Dao God's will has not yet come. In fact, there is still room for recovery. What if this happens here? He was injured and his cultivation was damaged. We don't care. This is indeed an act of seeking death!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Miss Ajuan rolled her eyes at Zhou Zhentian and silently shook her little head.</p>

    <p>She said seeking death...</p>

    <p>It doesn't mean a monk!</p>

    <p>People without self-awareness are really terrible.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The fragmented Daoxuan Hall. The monk raised his head and looked up at the sky at a 45Â° angle.</p>

    <p>He could see that the originally cloudless sky above God's Domain was suddenly shrouded in countless white clouds.</p>

    <p>These white clouds gradually separated into blood in sight, turned into blood vessels, and finally condensed into the shape of a brain.</p>

    <p>"The brain of Dao God appears. The will is coming!"</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Supremes look up to the sky.</p>

    <p>Now the sky above the entire God's Domain is dyed with a gloomy blood color. There is a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>The strong mental pressure is only taking shape. The sky is stained with blood and the earth is shaking.</p>

    <p>"Dao God will...Oh no. It's too late." Death Heavenly Dao frowned. This pressure made him feel breathless.</p>

    <p>He had no choice but to expand his core world and take in Zhuo Yi who encountered the Buddha's Golden Lotus. He also protected Sun Rong together.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, senior?" Zhuo Yi didn't know what happened.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Dao Supreme actually summoned the will of Dao God...and it should be the Zhou family's initiative..." Death said with a frown.</p>

    <p>When God's will comes, the entire space of God's Domain will be sealed. You can't get out or get in.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to leave directly with Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong. But it was still a step too late.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about the power of Dao God.</p>

    <p>None of the six main themes, Heavenly Dao, is a match for Dao God.</p>

    <p>It is conceivable that it is so strong.</p>

    <p>"You have to stay away!"</p>

    <p>Feeling this extraordinary spiritual pressure, Heavenly Dao's subconscious intention was to stay away from Daoxuan Hall.</p>

    <p>This will of God is directed at the monk Jin Deng in the center of Daoxuan Hall.</p>

    <p>The main pressure is concentrated there. The surrounding areas are only radiated by the will of Dao God.</p>

    <p>So the farther away they are. The less pressure there is.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Ah hahaha! Monk! You have transcended! Aren't you very capable? You have the ability. Transcend, transcend this God's will!" At this time, Zhou Zhentian, the elder of the Zhou family, couldn't stop laughing.</p>

    <p>He has endured the monk for a long time. Now the will of God is about to come. He can already imagine the scene of the monk being beaten up.</p>

    <p>In the Daoxuan Hall, the monk silently turned the rosary in his hand.</p>

    <p>He stared at the blood-stained sky.</p>

    <p>The brain of Dao God, which is made up of clouds, is becoming clearer and clearer in sight. It has almost condensed into substance.</p>

    <p>This huge brain of Dao God almost filled the entire sky of the God Realm. Countless spiritual energy was absorbed by it, and then bloomed from it, emitting a soul-shaking immortal sound.</p>

    <p>This is the sound of God breathing!</p>

    <p>And Dao God's will is God's will</p>

    <p>"A powerful force indeed."</p>

    <p>The monk looked at this scene with his heart still.</p>

    <p>Compared to the seven Dao Supremes, this kind of power is barely enough.</p>

    <p>"Monk, why don't you take action? Are you too scared to move?" Zhou Zhentian asked scolding.</p>

    <p>It takes a certain amount of time for God's will to form. If it finally takes shape, its power will be at its strongest.</p>

    <p>If you want to stop Dao God's will, the best way is to take action before it is completely formed. Defeat the Dao God's brain in the air.</p>

    <p>But defeating the brain of Dao God is not an easy task.</p>

    <p>The monk hesitated to take action. This made Zhou Zhentian confused.</p>

    <p>He felt that the monk was probably frightened out of his wits.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, how could we miss such a good opportunity?</p>

    <p>In the center of Daoxuan Hall, the monk recited Buddhist scriptures silently. He waited for about three minutes.</p>

    <p>Then. He suddenly raised his head.</p>

    <p>Facing the Dao God's brain in the air. Stretch out your hand!</p>

    <p>The moment the monk's hand reached out, it almost doubled in size. Countless spiritual energy was accumulated in his palm. He slapped Dao God's brain hard!</p>

    <p>This hand stretches for hundreds of kilometers. It seems to cover the entire world in one grasp!</p>

    <p>"Is this monk crazy..."</p>

    <p>"No! He did it on purpose! This monk is not afraid of Dao God at all!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my God! Who is this monk?"</p>

    <p>Now the Seven Dao Supreme finally understood the reason why the monk had not taken action yet.</p>

    <p>He wasn't stunned.</p>

    <p>But waiting on purpose.</p>

    <p>Until the will of Dao God finally takes shape. Take action when the spiritual pressure is at its peak! Compete with the will of Dao God!</p>

    <p>The monk resisted the operation of Dao God's will with one hand. The whole audience was shocked.</p>

    <p>The brain of God sensed the disobedience at hand and instantly released the powerful divine thunder.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The sky is full of waves, and the silver snakes are dancing wildly. It seems as if they want to smash the monk's big hand that wraps the brain of God into pieces!</p>

    <p>"Useless work."</p>

    <p>The monk shook his head.</p>

    <p>This divine thunder struck his palm, like itching.</p>

    <p>It's just the will of Dao God. He hasn't fully paid attention to it yet.</p>

    <p>Need to know.</p>

    <p>When Dao Ancestor Wang was promoted to Dao God, he was by Dao Ancestor Wang's side.</p>

    <p>That kind of scene of Tribulation Transcendence. The heaven and earth are deviated, the space is disintegrated, everything is distorted by the powerful force and mixed into a ball like a twist. It is like the beginning of the universe.</p>

    <p>The monks have all witnessed such a big scene with their own eyes.</p>

    <p>This is God's will. He really didn't take it seriously.</p>

    <p>"Let's disperse..."</p>

    <p>The next moment, the monk gradually closed his five fingers.</p>

    <p>As long as the brain of God is crushed, everything will be solved.</p>

    <p>But at this moment!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, another Dao God brain appeared in the sky!</p>

    <p>Standing side by side with the brain of Dao God that the monk is about to capture!</p>

    <p>"The head of the Li family also took action!" At this time, a Dao Supreme exclaimed.</p>

    <p>Although the head of the Li family's Dao God brain has not yet been fully formed.</p>

    <p>But the two heads of Dao God appear side by side, and it is rare to see the same enemy!</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, all the cultivators in God's Domain were dumbfounded!</p>

    <p>Who is it!?</p>

    <p>It can attract the attention of the two Dao Gods! Let the two Dao Gods join forces to resist!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the mental pressure between heaven and earth became even greater!</p>

    <p>However, facing this scene, the monk remained calm.</p>

    <p>"Two brains of Dao God..." The monk raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>After confirming that the Gu family, Wang family, and Liu family will not take action.</p>

    <p>In other words, the remaining seven Dao Gods may join the battle at any time.</p>

    <p>Although the monk can still control the current situation.</p>

    <p>But if all seven Dao Gods join in, he might not be able to stand it anymore.</p>

    <p>After all, in the previous battle with Wang Ling, the monk had already lost 3,000 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>With his remaining 910 lifetimes of cultivation, being able to withstand three is already his limit.</p>

    <p>If more.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren needs help.</p>

    <p>But the monk was not panicked.</p>

    <p>Because he has sensed that the strongest man on earth has noticed this.</p>

    <p>He is peeking into the screen, ready to take action if necessary.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk should try to solve it by himself first..."</p>

    <p>So the monk sighed inwardly and opened his palm wider.</p>

    <p>At the same time, two Dao God brains are covered in it.</p>

    <p>Then it's like those old men in the park playing with walnuts.</p>

    <p>He held the two Dao God brains in the palm of his hand and turned them around...</p>

    <p>The two Dao God brains were in the monk's palm. They were constantly rubbing and rotating like a drum washing machine, making a rattling sound.</p>

    <p>This scene made the Ajuan girl laugh again and roll on the floor.</p>

    <p>It's still that devilish laugh. Like a barbell...</p>
