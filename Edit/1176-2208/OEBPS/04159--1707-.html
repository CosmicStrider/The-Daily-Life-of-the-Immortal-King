  <h1>Chapter 1707 The Monk Eating Hot Pot</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"The key has been confirmed. Unlocking the specific containment space passage related to SCB-L002..."</p>

    <p>When the familiar electronic sound sounded in Jingze's ears, Wu Xin took him to the specific containment space of SCB-L002. This is the special space provided by Bai Zhe for all the noble dragonborn born. Every one The space is an independent core world. There is no sense of oppression of being comfortable in a cubic container.</p>

    <p>Such an improvement was something Wu Xin did not expect. Back then, he imprisoned the creatures in those cubic containers. Unexpectedly, some of the creatures became even more cruel after being restrained inside.</p>

    <p>The scene before him also served as a reflection on the past for Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>However, such a big deal as one dragonborn and one core world cannot be accomplished by ordinary people.</p>

    <p>A normal cultivator is full of difficulties and obstacles from the beginning of giving birth to an inherent spiritual realm. And from the inherent spiritual realm to the big and small worlds and the subsequent supreme world, the years spent in this period must have gone through eternal changes...</p>

    <p>Not to mention gestating the space in one's own body to the "Supreme World." Even to gestate to the "Core World", it would take thousands of years. Nearly ten thousand years...</p>

    <p>But now Bai Zhe's side has given away the core world to this person for free, and even laid eggs to equip each dragonborn with one. This person's skill is indeed a bit sensational.</p>

    <p>This is a high-temperature core world. The core temperature in the deep area reaches over 70Â°. Wang Ming's body is only a mortal body. It is impossible to withstand such a temperature. But fortunately, Master Wu Xin has been prepared.</p>

    <p>He is wearing an improved defensive suit, allowing him to walk unhindered on this land with the help of the black technology he created.</p>

    <p>Jingze, who was beside him, was completely indifferent. It was impossible for such a temperature to harm the dragonborn who had stabilized and was almost ready to mature.</p>

    <p>The two of them approached the core area one after another. In front of the huge pyrotechnic waterfall, magma with a temperature of tens of thousands of degrees fell from above. A loud roar could be heard.</p>

    <p>"Yan?. I brought your partner here. Look, I also prepared your favorite thing." Wu Xin said while standing at the port where his feet were a little hot.</p>

    <p>Then he took out a special blue small box from the storage space. The box gave off a frightening cold air. Jingze thought that there might be some magic weapon inside. But when Wu Xin opened the button and opened it, he was stunned on the spot.</p>

    <p>Inside this box, there are actually all kinds of ice creams. There are colorful cones, sundaes topped with strawberry jam, and attractively colored, crystal clear durian popsicles.</p>

    <p>These desserts were protected by special boxes. Even in this high temperature environment, they did not melt.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether I was surprised by Wu Xin's words or attracted by these desserts, but not long after, under the hanging Bakudan waterfall, a young girl with light blonde hair finally reveals the upper half of her face from the waterfall in a tentative manner, and then gradually exposes her entire body.</p>

    <p>This girl named Yan? was wearing a lace red dress. She had a delicate face like a doll. Jingze was stunned for a moment when he saw it.</p>

    <p>Soon, a string of data about Yan was synchronized to his smart goggles.</p>

    <p>SCB-L002:Yan?</p>

    <p>Dragonborn Age: 7 months</p>

    <p>Dragon Power: Explosive Dragon</p>

    <p>Dragon Breath Attribute: Fire</p>

    <p>Current actual combat power conversion realm: Early stage of Earthly Ancestor</p>

    <p>Exclusive Dragonborn Chaos Weapon: Burning Sky Chain Hammer</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Chain hammer?" Regarding the weapon used by Yan?, Jingze had some doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that such a small person could actually wield weapons that were completely inconsistent with her size and specifications.</p>

    <p>"Same as your diamond gloves. The Burning Sky Chain Hammer of Xian? is made from the chaos of the dragon bones corresponding to the power of your dragon. It is the exclusive chaos weapon of the Dragonborn. The Dragonborn Chaos Device on each of you is It is unique. It has more potential than those chaos devices that are directly bred from chaos." Wu Xin said.</p>

    <p>"So. What level is her Dragonborn Chaos Device?"</p>

    <p>"eh... The concentration of chaos is not as good as yours. It's only 61%. But it has reached sequence four."</p>

    <p>"Sequence four?" Jingze's calm face finally showed a surprised look.</p>

    <p>The sequence level of the chaos device represents the future potential of the chaos device. He was originally very satisfied with his diamond gloves that reached sequence three, which was the annihilation level.</p>

    <p>But after hearing the sequence level of the chaos device used by Yan?, I immediately felt that my diamond gloves were no longer fragrant.</p>

    <p>The dragon is more than a dragon, and the dragon is very angry.</p>

    <p>But if you think about it carefully, Jingze is not so unbalanced. Because the exclusive chaos device on his body is not just the diamond gloves. In fact, there is also a black umbrella that has not been used so far.</p>

    <p>And so far, among all the dragonborn, only Jingze was born with twin dragonborn chaos weapons.</p>

    <p>This particularity is one of the reasons why Jingze is so valued by Bai Zhe and others.</p>

    <p>The baby-faced girl with light-colored blond hair and a red dress lazily raised her eyes and glanced at Jingze. Then she squatted beside the blue box and started to devour these desserts.</p>

    <p>Ice cream is her favorite.</p>

    <p>"Yan?. I brought your partner." At this time, Wu Xin said.</p>

    <p>Yan? He was spooning strawberry sundae on his mouth. The expression on his face was a bit dissatisfied: "But... what I want is the guy who uses ice!"</p>

    <p>She has reported to Bai Zhe several times that she hopes to find a dragon with ice attributes as her partner. However, this request has been rejected.</p>

    <p>Mainly because of the conflicting attributes.</p>

    <p>If it were really that combination, the lethality would be greatly reduced.</p>

    <p>"Yan? Be good. You follow Jingze. You can eat as much ice cream as you want after that. He is very rich." Wu Xin said.</p>

    <p>"Really!" The girl glanced at Jingze dubiously.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she still doesn't have a good impression of this man wearing a khaki trench coat.</p>

    <p>But for the endless supply of ice cream, I can still endure this.</p>

    <p>Finally. She nodded: "Okay."</p>

    <p>"Is this right?" Wu Xin encouraged on the side: "Next, you will go on a mission together. You need to get rid of a very bad monk."</p>

    <p>"How bad?"</p>

    <p>"He likes to eat hot pot. He often puts the hot pot on his head and burns it."</p>

    <p>"But what I hate the most is hot pot!" Yan? suddenly became angry: "He will definitely die!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jingze sighed silently.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was right to guide Yan in this way. But what had to be said was that this kind of little girl who was not familiar with the world was indeed easy to deceive.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhang Zhui took Li Xian and Zhai Yin and quickly returned to the Office of Strategic Deception for help. Zhai Yin's condition was okay. But Li Xian's injury was really serious. He vomited again on the way back to the Office of Strategic Deception. Several mouthfuls of blood.</p>

    <p>The annihilation-level diamond gloves were so lethal that their souls were damaged.</p>

    <p>Although Li Xian's state would not lead to death, it is rare for such serious injuries to appear on an eternal person.</p>

    <p>He had notified the core group of Office of Strategic Deception on his way to the Office of Strategic Deception. As soon as he arrived at Zongmen Mountain Pass, Immortal Toya, Cailian Zhenren and Monk Jin Deng had already appeared in front of the mountain gate to greet him.</p>

    <p>"How could the injury be so severe?"</p>

    <p>"It's too late to explain. Monk, let's talk as we walk." Zhang Zhui carried Li Xian on his back. He was very anxious in his heart. At the same time, he also had ten thousand regrets in his heart. He regretted that he acted arbitrarily with Li Xian and went deep into the enemy without any report.</p>

    <p>I didn't even expect to receive such backlash...</p>

    <p>Of course, the most critical situation before may not be just Li Xian's injury.</p>

    <p>There is also Wang Ming who has been completely controlled and remains in the floating boat in the air.</p>
