  <h1>Chapter 1647 5 Lightning Whips</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi didn't want to admit it, she did feel a little bit irrational at this moment. When she thought about Zhuo Yi, she felt that she could no longer think about the problem normally.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the door of the nearest police station, the three of them stopped in front of the door.</p>

    <p>By establishing a team chat window, Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi achieved spiritual communication between the two girls. This ensured that it would not be heard by irrelevant people.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Liangzi. Do you really want to go in and report Senior Li Xian and Senior Zhang Zhui..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi sighed: "I...actually don't want to, especially Senior Li Xian. He is the benefactor of our Jiugong family. But, these are extraordinary times."</p>

    <p>"But have you ever thought about it. Even if we sell two seniors, for just tens of thousands of dollars, the people in this underground boxing ring won't even take a look..."</p>

    <p>Cloak Underground. Sun Rong looked helpless. Although she didn't understand the rules of the underground boxing ring.</p>

    <p>But with her basic understanding of the elite circles, such a place was opened underground because it was not popular. And the admission conditions are also very demanding.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, you are extremely rich. Maybe you can make an exception.</p>

    <p>So just like that, the scene fell into silence again.</p>

    <p>About a few minutes later, two service-type intelligent robot police officers outside the police station carried out a man covered in blood on a stretcher from an off-road police vehicle.</p>

    <p>The man's body was covered with blood-stained bandages. His entire right arm had been broken. The wiring inside was exposed, and sparks kept making sizzling sounds.</p>

    <p>Inside the police station, a middle-aged man with a big belly wearing a brown windbreaker and chewing a cigar walked out. His lower body was very strange. He had no legs, but two tracks... resembling a humanoid tank.</p>

    <p>As soon as the man appeared, all the smart robot policemen in the car saluted him: "Director Ducas!"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man waved his hand, blew out a puff of smoke, and looked at the man under him. The expression on his face was a bit resentful: "How many rounds has he lasted to?"</p>

    <p>"We're on to the fourth round. Unfortunately, we still can't make it through." Robot Police replied.</p>

    <p>Their voices have an electronic sound effect. It feels very funny when they speak. But when faced with answers, their reaction speed is amazing. It's like Zhenren.</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. We still have one round left to get in. I'm afraid I won't be able to play in this restaurant. It's boring."</p>

    <p>In the middle-aged man's sigh, the sound of electricity sizzling out from the person on the stretcher just disappeared. He breathed his last completely.</p>

    <p>On the side. The two girls, Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi, felt sick at heart.</p>

    <p>Aohai's healing sword energy only has an effect on humans. When half of the tissues in a cyborg's body are mechanical, Sun Rong has no choice at all.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you send him to the clinic first?"</p>

    <p>"The doctors at the scene judged that there was no hope of recovery. The clinic was in short supply of spare parts. The treatment was not good and it was taking up resources."</p>

    <p>"That's pitiful." The middle-aged man said, "That's all. Just send him home. In addition, the pension stipulated in the contract must be paid."</p>

    <p>"Understood. Director." Then, two mechanical policemen carried a stretcher and put the poor dead man back into the car.</p>

    <p>Seeing the police car leaving. The middle-aged man named Dekas suddenly turned his head to look at the three Sun Rongs at the side: "You three. Are you also here to prove yourselves as my fighters? What's the matter ? Seeing a dead man. Are you too scared to speak?"</p>

    <p>He laughed: "You're kidding. I don't expect two girls to box for me. This guy next to me looks thin and tender. He doesn't look like a trainer. Are you three brothers and sisters?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi objected awkwardly: "They are not brothers and sisters. They are just purely curious about the boxing ring. I remember, isn't it the decisive battle between Mr. Jian Xiaoqiang and Mr. Niu Baoguo tonight? The semi-finals are over, right?"</p>

    <p>She tried to talk.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the man named Ducas not only did not find it troublesome, but actually found it interesting for a girl to inquire about such things.</p>

    <p>He took a puff on his cigar. He said, "You women know nothing of the pleasures of the rich and powerful. What would you know of the joys that the rich and powerful have. Before the final, there's a kickboxing tournament. You' ll have to play five rounds to qualify. And then a pre-match with last year's champion."</p>

    <p>"Because the fight is for life. One of the two people must die. The person just signed a life-and-death contract with me and was sent over."</p>

    <p>"Is that person doing it for his family?"</p>

    <p>"In such a slum, it's natural for livelihood considerations. The debt their family owes. If he hadn't stood up to fight this battle for me, I'm afraid it wouldn't be a big deal at all."</p>

    <p>Ducas smiled mockingly: "But it's a pity. We have already reached the fourth level. If we can break through the fifth level and challenge last year's Kickboxing King and win, we will get a full 6 million bonus. We can jump out of this slum in one fell swoop. !"</p>

    <p>"6 million? Silver gear coins?"</p>

    <p>"No! It's the Golden Gear Coin!"</p>

    <p>Ducas's voice got louder: "And it's not just the 6 million! There is also a pass to the core area! I made an agreement with the man just now. I will provide the registration funds and the entire cost. He will fight for me. If I win, I will win. Get three million. The remaining three million and the pass are mine!"</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi nodded.</p>

    <p>They figured out the general situation.</p>

    <p>And judging from the director's narration, this person is not too bad...</p>

    <p>At least he fulfilled his promise to the man on the stretcher.</p>

    <p>"So. That final was just a betting fun for the poor. This life-and-death match is the most exciting!"</p>

    <p>"However, last year's kicking champion was very strong. I think he will flourish this year. Because until now, no one has passed the fifth level. If no one can challenge him, he will lie down and enter the core area.</p>

    <p>"Then who was last year's best player?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Actually, last year's Kick-Kick King was none other than Mr. Niu Baoguo's master, Hu Baoguo. Last year, he single-handedly challenged the five major masters arranged by the powerful circle. He only used one move to defeat the Kick-Kick King of the year before. Kill!"</p>

    <p>"One move?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! A move! It is said that when he used it, it was so fast that people couldn't see his movements... By the time he reacted, the person was already at the bottom. Those who were watching at the scene only felt that there was thunder, lightning, and thunder in front of them. !"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And this move is also called by him!--Five Lightning Whips!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The more Ducas talked, the more excited he became. Veins popped up on his forehead. He had to rub his temples, which were twitching with excitement: "Sorry. I was too excited by accident. I talked too much with you girls."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Director, can you let me try?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiugong Liangzi took the initiative to stand up.</p>

    <p>This initiative made Sun Rong and the Monk's eyes twitch.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect Jiugong Liangzi to do this...</p>

    <p>Of course. Jiugong Liangzi has this confidence. He is not just giving his head away.</p>

    <p>She had just estimated the level of strength of the seriously injured man. It felt like he was at the peak of the late Golden Core.</p>

    <p>If the ghost talisman on her body is added, she might be qualified to challenge it on her own. If not, Monk Jin Deng will be behind to guarantee it. It is very stable.</p>

    <p>"You?" Ducas laughed: "A woman shouldn't join in the fun...even though you don't look like a woman."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's forehead veins twitched: "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Ducas hehe: "Of course I mean your breasts are so flat. You can hardly be considered a woman. Forget about the Martial Arts Competition."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt a strong negative air wave in front of him!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi mobilized the power of the ghost talisman. He struck the ground heavily with his lowered fist. What he imagined in his mind was the scene of Zhuo Yi cheating... and cheating with a man!</p>

    <p>Such a double rage coupled with Ducas's accurate lightning strike caused Jiugong Liangzi to explode in an instant with unparalleled explosive destructive power.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The ground in front of the police station was smashed by Jiugong Liangzi into a deep pit of more than ten meters. The ground nearby was cracked. It was like an earthquake.</p>

    <p>"hiss!--"</p>

    <p>This scene made Sun Rong and monk Jin Deng gasp at the same time.</p>

    <p>The woman in "Caught in the act"... I'm sure it's horrible...</p>

    <p>The most horrifying thing is naturally the director Ducas.</p>

    <p>After being stunned for less than three seconds, his face instantly became filled with surprise: "Hahahaha! I didn't expect that! I, Ducas, also made a mistake one day! This girl, I'm sorry for my gaffe just now." I shouldn't look down on you and attack you..." (Although. Ducas doesn't think Jiugong Liangzi will be able to grow breasts in the future... As a man who has met countless people, he has experience in this area. He basically sees it at a glance. Understood...)</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi patted the dust on his hands and looked at Ducas: "There is no need for a life and death contract. Anyway, I will definitely win. But after winning, the pass will be yours. The prize money. I want five million gold."</p>

    <p>"Interesting." Ducas laughed: "Well, that's what we have agreed! But there are less than five hours left before the finals start. This means that you have to challenge five levels in a row."</p>

    <p>"But there's a problem. Five levels plus the winner of last year's tournament, right? l Jiugong, am not afraid."</p>

    <p>"So your name is Jiugong."</p>

    <p>Ducas' eyes darted around: "Here's the deal. I'll give you a new fake identity. You can call yourself Gong. No one uses their real name in that underground boxing ring. They all have fake identities when they go in."</p>

    <p>"Then can you get one for my sister and brother?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh, so those are your sister and brother behind you? I see. Since it's Jiugong... Oh, no. It's Ms. Gong's request. I'll do as I'm told! Wait for me here. I'll have a new ID card made right away." Ducas was thrilled. Rolling on his tracks, he rushed into the station.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi saw him leave. Hastily looking back at Jin Deng, Liangzi looked at the leading monk with a kind of pleading gaze: "Senpai... Can you... Can you... help me...? Can you enlighten me a little bit?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "..."</p>

    <p>He knew this was going to happen...</p>
