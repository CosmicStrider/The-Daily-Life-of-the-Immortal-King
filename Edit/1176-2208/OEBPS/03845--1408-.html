  <h1>Chapter 1408 Miss Sun has insomnia!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The King of Sword Spirits. Come to the end in person! Shocking the entire Sword King World!</p>

    <p>This is something that no sword spirit would ever think of.</p>

    <p>"A newly born little sword spirit was chosen by the sword king and became his disciple..."</p>

    <p>Jian Shen Square. Countless sword spirits were stunned.</p>

    <p>Their emotions were ups and downs, and they knew deeply that they might be witnessing history!</p>

    <p>"Has the Sword King ever had an apprentice?"</p>

    <p>"No... this little sword spirit named Leng Ming is the first!"</p>

    <p>"We actually openly accepted disciples. My youth is over!"</p>

    <p>Many sword spirits sighed with emotion on the spot. As a newly born little sword spirit, Leng Ming was spotted by the king of sword spirits with extremely high qualifications. He accepted him as a disciple...</p>

    <p>Maybe Dian Ming is right. People like Carter and Wu Jin cannot protect Leng Ming's thoughtfulness.</p>

    <p>There are always times when Leng Ming is not by his side.</p>

    <p>But now, the boss of the entire sword king world has appeared and openly accepted this little sword spirit as his disciple.</p>

    <p>If anyone dares to stir up trouble again, Dian Ming will end up with his eyes being pressed by a sword and being knocked into the ground, bleeding from seven holes.</p>

    <p>This is a deterrent. It is also a warning.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the sword spirits in the Sword Master Square who were originally hostile to Leng Ming out of jealousy all restrained their thoughts.</p>

    <p>This little sword spirit has a different starting point...</p>

    <p>The King of Sword Spirits is often absent from the Sword King Realm. In fact, the Sword Spirits have never found an opportunity to curry favor with Jingke.</p>

    <p>Now Leng Ming has become Jingke's disciple. Naturally, he has become the first person to fawn over.</p>

    <p>The Sword Spirit Square instantly became lively. Many Sword Spirits who were well-known in the Sword King world came forward one after another and began to offer benefits to Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>"Little brother, I run the Royal Sword Spirit Bathing Center. Come here to bathe. Tell me my name, Qiao Shan! No charge!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Leng Ming, our family runs a medical clinic! Chen Cang Medical Clinic! If you feel unwell, uncle will come and check your body!"</p>

    <p>"You all go away. Don't bring up the children... Come here! Xiao Leng Ming. My sister runs a tutoring institution. If you are in need of teachers, you can always look for me!"</p>

    <p>For a time, because of Leng Ming's little episode, the situation got out of control.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Jingke's fate gave clear instructions to Carter, Wu Jin, and Lao Man. Now they have made their attitude towards Leng Ming clearer.</p>

    <p>The chaotic scene lasted for about ten minutes.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Jiu You and Yu Ling passed by that the noisy square regained its calm.</p>

    <p>A man and a woman fell from the sky. They looked like a beautiful couple.</p>

    <p>"It's Master Jiu You and Master Yu Ling! They are here too!"</p>

    <p>"I heard that Mr. Jiu You specially asked Mr. Yu Ling to be the judge this time."</p>

    <p>Many people have long mistakenly believed that there is a relationship between Jiu You and Yu Ling.</p>

    <p>Jiu You is also very helpless about this.</p>

    <p>He would rather...</p>

    <p>But what about Yu Ling? The only two people she cares about are Jingke and Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Take this time for example. As soon as I heard that Bai Qiao invited me to be a judge, I came without saying a word.</p>

    <p>After all, he is the third-ranked sword spirit on the sword list. There is no need to give him the honor of being ranked fifth...</p>

    <p>Hey. Being one level higher on the list is overwhelming!</p>

    <p>On the way to the square, Jiu You smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Yu Ling rarely appeared in crowded places. Facing the unprecedented grand scene of Jian Shen Square in front of her, she even felt a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>But it can be seen that she is still trying to adjust her mood.</p>

    <p>Yu Ling waved her hand and held her waist with one hand. She had a graceful figure and showed off her perfect curves: "Please take care of me. I am also one of the judges for this Sword conference."</p>

    <p>The sweet voice suddenly swept through the entire Jian Shen Square, making many male sword spirits think about it.</p>

    <p>I can't stand just hearing the sound!</p>

    <p>"Master Yu Ling is so beautiful! She looks like an immortal who stepped out of a painting!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! Master Yu Ling's voice is as beautiful as Master Mo Yu's! The contestants who take part this time are blessed!"</p>

    <p>"With Master Yu Ling joining us, I believe the competition will be fair and just!" Fei Lu</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And as Yu Ling appeared.</p>

    <p>So far.</p>

    <p>The lineup of judges for the Sword competition has also been finalized. They are the ones ranked 3456th on the sword list.</p>

    <p>According to the order of the sword list, they are: Yu Ling, Mo Yu, Jiu You, Xiao Qian.</p>

    <p>"Everyone is quiet. Jian Shen Square. No noise!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiu You whispered, and it had an immediate effect.</p>

    <p>Although he is only an escrow, Jiu You still has the dignity of an escrow.</p>

    <p>Later, under the suppression of Jiu You and others, order was restored at the scene.</p>

    <p>Everything is going on in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>Jiu You estimates that there will be 1,000 shortlisted auditions for five groups, and they will all be done tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Then, just wait for the girl to come and compete the day after tomorrow.</p>

    <p>It can be said that everything is ready and all we need is the east wind.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, December 8.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had a sleepless night.</p>

    <p>Girls always worry about their skin. So even Sun Rong. Her habit is to go to bed early.</p>

    <p>But that painful feeling of tossing and turning. The girl fully experienced it last night.</p>

    <p>All she could think about was Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I am constantly guessing about this girl's background, personality, hobbies, etc. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Because Sun Rong was born with a huge brain and the ability to make up her mind, in the process of thinking about Jiang Yingying, she directly created a girl romance novel of more than 100,000 words in her mind from the perspective of Jiang Yingying.. The story became more complicated and bizarre the more she thought about it. It directly caused her to fall into insomnia.</p>

    <p>When I got up, Sun Rong looked in the mirror. After discovering that I had no dark circles, I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"You're a cultivator. Some people can't sleep without sleeping for several years. Rongrong didn't sleep for just one night? He won't have any dark circles!" Sun Ying'er comforted him at the side.</p>

    <p>She witnessed the girl setting a new rolling record in bed last night.</p>

    <p>Rolling back and forth on the big bed that was tens of meters long. In the morning, it felt like I had completed a marathon.</p>

    <p>The girl was worried that her complexion would look bad. She looked in the mirror as soon as she woke up.</p>

    <p>However, as a shadow, Sun Ying'er's focus was not on the girl's face at all. He was just looking at the girl's chest in front of the mirror with worry...</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. If you can't sleep in the future, try not to roll around." Sun Ying'er suggested with sincerity.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "???"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "It's not big to begin with. What if it gets flattened?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong clenched her fists in embarrassment. She wished she could sew Sun Ying'er's mouth shut...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This morning. Wang Ling walked in directly from the school gate.</p>

    <p>He no longer dared to take the convenient teleportation circle. Mainly because he was worried that the circle would be blown up by him again.</p>

    <p>When they arrived at the classroom, Wang Ling found that Guo Hao and Chen Chao were already sitting in the classroom.</p>

    <p>The two of them probably got up early in the morning to copy each other's homework...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling Have you heard? Something happened to Wang Zhen next door!" Guo Hao took the initiative to talk to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Eh?"Wang Ling pretended to be calm.</p>

    <p>"It seems to be related to the strange group of people who appeared at the door before... Those people said they were actors. I think they are from the underworld..." Guo Hao said very mysteriously: "I heard. Wang Zhen's My knees were broken by those gangsters!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>So sometimes people still can't be too confident in their knees...</p>

    <p>How hard is the Heavenly Dao durian he inspired?</p>

    <p>Who knows who is kneeling!</p>
