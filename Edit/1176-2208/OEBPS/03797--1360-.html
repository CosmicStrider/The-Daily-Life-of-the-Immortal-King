  <h1>Chapter 1360 The list of people who must not be provoked</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao River God was destroyed in an instant. Zhao Qingxian's surprise could no longer be described in words.</p>

    <p>He only knew one Buddhist sage, "Monk Jin Deng." He did not expect that Mr. Shuangji in front of him was also a Buddhist sage.</p>

    <p>The strength of monk Jin Deng. Zhao Qingxian has already experienced it</p>

    <p>Even before coming to this earth, Zhao Qingxian still remembered the words his father left for him.</p>

    <p>His father was afraid that he would cause trouble when he came to Earth, so he left him a list of people he must not mess with.</p>

    <p>In this list, in addition to Ling Zhenren at the top of the list, the name of monk Jin Deng is also on the list.</p>

    <p>"A list that must not be messed with?" At this time, Mr. Shuangji smiled slightly in front of him.</p>

    <p>His mind-reading ability is as powerful as Monk Jin Deng's.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Shuangji knows things like a god"</p>

    <p>"It's just some little tricks." Yang Shuangji said: "Your list is quite interesting. I didn't expect that even my senior brother's name is on it."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Shuangji, are you talking about senior Jin Deng?" Zhao Qingxian was shocked.</p>

    <p>The Yang Shuangji in front of me is actually the junior brother of Monk Jin Deng?</p>

    <p>"Jin Deng is indeed my senior brother. But he probably doesn't know that I'm still alive."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji said casually: "Maybe for him, my existence may be bad news. Because then, he will no longer be the only successor of the master."</p>

    <p>"Zhao Qingxian didn't dare to talk.</p>

    <p>Although Yang Shuangji in front of him claimed to be monk Jin Deng's junior brother, Zhao Qingxian felt that this man had a strange feeling all over his body.</p>

    <p>"If Donor Zhao feels that my words are not credible, it is actually normal. It is necessary to be on guard against others. But I believe that time and reality will prove everything."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji looked at the information on the list carefully. He couldn't help but smile: "Donor Zhao, how about we kill all the people on this list together?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian thought he heard wrongly: "What are you talking about, sir?"</p>

    <p>He couldn't believe that the person in front of him was so bold and would say such a thing.</p>

    <p>"Donor Zhao, don't worry. In fact, I have returned to secular life a long time ago. So killing a few people can only be regarded as a basic operation for me."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji said calmly, as if he was just talking about a few ants: "I'm not even afraid of the Heavenly Dao. I dare not even go against the sky. Not to mention the killings under my hands."</p>

    <p>"But sir, you don't understand." Zhao Qingxian tried his best to stop Yang Shuangji's crazy thoughts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's method. Although he has not witnessed it with his own eyes</p>

    <p>Because when Wang Ling took action in God's Domain, the sense of oppression was too strong. Zhao Qingxian did not react at all. He had already fainted.</p>

    <p>He learned about Ling Zhenren from the servants of the Zhao family, several clan elders, and his father.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, the head of the Zhao family gave many instructions, saying that this person should not be provoked.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian naturally couldn't turn a deaf ear to it.</p>

    <p>He came to Earth on the orders of his father. He also came to curry favor with Ling Zhenren. Therefore, it was absolutely impossible for him to do such a treasonous thing.</p>

    <p>Of course, Liu Qingyi's matter is also very important.</p>

    <p>The relationship between Liu Qingyi and Ling Zhenren is extraordinary. So if he wants to catch up with Liu Qingyi, it is even more impossible for Zhao Qingxian to offend Wang Ling</p>

    <p>"I know what you're afraid of."</p>

    <p>At this time, Yang Shuangji said: "The donor named Wang in the list. If my guess is correct, this is all a trick of my senior brother."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean, senior?" Zhao Qingxian was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"My senior brother is originally a complete liar. He sings a double act, but this is his common trick."</p>

    <p>"Sing an double act?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. My senior brother has created countless legendary characters. He was even named the Vest Buddha."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji said: "Senior brother, he has been reincarnated for so many lives. He has experienced everything from pretending to be a woman to being an emperor, to being a beggar, an eunuch, and dying in a fat house. With such rich experiences, he has created a vest for himself. It is absolutely amazing. It's not difficult."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhao Qingxian understood instantly.</p>

    <p>Vest Buddha</p>

    <p>In other words, Ling Zhenren is actually a vest issued by monk Jin Deng?</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian was completely confused when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Now. He is beginning to be unable to tell which side is correct.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, he really didn't see Wang Ling's strength with his own eyes. He only knew from word of mouth that there was such a ridiculously strong man.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Yang Shuangji spoke categorically, as if he was extremely confident in his reasoning. This made Zhao Qingxian full of doubts.</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji's eyes gradually became crazy: "My senior brother's strength is beyond eternity. If I were not still alive, I am afraid there would be no one in this world who could restrain him. Except for me, there would be no one. Than He is even stronger than a human being. If he has one, it must be his vest."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "What does that mean?"</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji: "I just need you to follow me for the time being and then witness with me the moment when my senior brother's conspiracy is exposed!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "But I still don't understand. Why did Mr. choose me?"</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji: "Maybe you haven't realized it yet. You are a very important witness."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian couldn't believe it: "Me?"</p>

    <p>"Your father asked you to come to earth just to curry favor with the so-called powerful one. But in fact, you don't need to curry favor with anyone."</p>

    <p>When Yang Shuangji said this, he couldn't help but smile: "Everything is destined. In short, follow me and you will get everything you want."</p>

    <p>"Then I am willing to give it a try with your husband." Zhao Qingxian gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p>"Very good." Yang Shuangji nodded with satisfaction: "First of all, our first step is to expose my senior brother's conspiracy and eliminate the vests he spawned."</p>

    <p>"Are you confident, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji chuckled: "No one can resist my Shura pestle."</p>

    <p>On the other side. The Wang family's small villa. The monk is solving the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>The hexahedron Rubik's Cube. Wang Ling played with it like a toy for a while after visiting the King's Eyes store, and then put it aside.</p>

    <p>Now I heard that Jin Deng wanted to use it to make a utensil. Wang Ling did not hesitate to give it to him. Anyway, it was useless to him.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren gave it to me. It's so refreshing."</p>

    <p>The monk thought that finding the Rubik's Cube might not be an easy task.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was holding the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. The expression on his face suddenly became melancholy.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Jin Deng thought of the scene where he and his junior brother competed to play with the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>"Do you have a junior brother?" Wang Ling read the monk's thoughts and asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes. My junior brother. But he passed away a long time ago. And he was also a Rubik's Cube enthusiast."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng holds the Rubik's Cube in his hand. The feeling of seeing things and thinking about others arises spontaneously.</p>

    <p>The monk considers himself not a particularly sentimental person.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why. He held the Rubik's Cube and suddenly felt as if his junior brother was not dead yet.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure? Is your junior brother dead?" At this time, Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said concisely and concisely: "He must be dead. I scattered the ashes."</p>
