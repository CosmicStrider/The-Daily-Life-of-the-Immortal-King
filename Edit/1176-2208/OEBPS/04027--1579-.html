  <h1>Chapter 1579 The tacit understanding between brother and sisterâ‘¢</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the moment when she recognized the reality, five words immediately popped into Fenmu Shen's mind.</p>

    <p>That is: What a slap in the face!</p>

    <p>The inheritance rights to the sky tomb that he had worked so hard to obtain were actually completely copied by a girl using her own abilities.</p>

    <p>This is a fact that Fenmu Shen neither dares to imagine nor accept.</p>

    <p>Now he is trapped in the shadow space. He is restricted by Wang Nuan at every turn.</p>

    <p>Coupled with the constant impact of the herringbone seal just now, Fenmu Shen's face turned pale for a moment. It was quite ugly.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to really lose at the hands of a baby.</p>

    <p>So I had to work hard to think of ways to get out of the predicament.</p>

    <p>Eternal-level powerhouses. Creatures that have survived since the beginning of the universe... How many people have turned into bones in the eternal years. But Fenmu Shen is still alive. The reason behind this is probably the continuous accumulation of experience and some specific factors.</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen stared at Wang Nuan and thought deeply.</p>

    <p>Although the current situation was very unfavorable to him, he never thought of showing his trump card in front of a newborn girl...</p>

    <p>I remember the match between Dao Ancestor Wang and him.</p>

    <p>He did not play that card until he was about to die. Instead, he exercised extreme forbearance.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of others, it is a spiritual game between eternal powerful men.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen knew very well that the last trump card he had was an existence that even the old guy Dao Ancestor Wang was afraid of... Therefore, the old guy only dared to separate and seal him, but did not dare to kill him completely.</p>

    <p>That old guy knows his personality. If he decides that it's a dead end, he will definitely drag someone down to support him.</p>

    <p>However, the current situation cannot be called a "dead end" for Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>It's just a "dilemma."</p>

    <p>It's like a game of chess. He believes that as long as he plays it correctly, there is still room for a comeback.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen's brows condensed. Laws appeared on his body. Countless black curse marks seeped out from every inch of his skin, covering his whole body instantly like a reptile.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his evil purple pupils burst out with a horrifying light, as if he was analyzing something.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, Fenmu Shen looked ecstatic and raised her lips again: "I see...this is the power of Shadow!"</p>

    <p>He seemed to have seen through something. He fell into that aloof posture again.</p>

    <p>Facing Fenmu Shen. Wang Nuan could not help but shed a drop of cold sweat on his forehead.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. From that second on, she really felt that the aura of the "monster" in front of her seemed to be a little different...</p>

    <p>I have become a lot more cautious.</p>

    <p>Inside the core conference room of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiThrough the sword light of "Yu", the battle images of Wang Nuan and Fenmu Shen in the universe are released.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that in addition to chopping vegetables, it also has such a function." Everyone was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It is the sword of prophecy, the sword of destiny. The sword light itself has the ability to analyze time and space." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face should have been a proud smile. But there seems to be something wrong with the current battle situation in the universe.</p>

    <p>"What the hell is Fenmu Shen up to..."</p>

    <p>"I don't know. But I feel that this person seems to be a little different from before. It seems that he has an aura of greatness."</p>

    <p>"There's an extra air of greatness?"</p>

    <p>Soon, Lord Diulei seemed to have thought of something. He suddenly raised his head and said, "Could it be said that the other party can complete the study of the art in an extreme time and learn Sister Nuan's Shadow like Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>"This... this is impossible..." Among the core members, many people looked in horror, showing disbelief.</p>

    <p>They couldn't understand it because it was so nerve-wracking!</p>

    <p>But it seems that there is only one reason for the situation in front of me. To explain...</p>

    <p>After all, the other party was the eternal evil god who gave Dao Ancestor Wang such a headache that he couldn't completely deal with it.</p>

    <p>Having such an ability is unexpected. But it is also reasonable.</p>

    <p>At this moment when everyone was thinking, another riot broke out in the shadow space of the universe!</p>

    <p>A big riot broke out in the originally stable shadow space. It seemed like it was about to burst apart.</p>

    <p>A powerful wave of energy is released!</p>

    <p>This is the unmistakable power of Shadow!</p>

    <p>But what is extremely shocking is that this energy was not released by Wang Nuan!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The pre-broadcast video was momentarily interrupted.</p>

    <p>On the other side, inside the waiting room of the players in Sun Island.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ming suddenly felt his eyes go dark. A force stopped him. The brain waves that caused him to scatter into the universe had to be taken back.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Zhai Yin walked over with concern and touched Wang Ming's forehead. It was very hot, but not to the extreme.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Sun Rong very skillfully applied a {cooling technique} to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Tear it apart!</p>

    <p>A large amount of white mist was instantly released above Wang Ming's head.</p>

    <p>"Much better..." Wang Ming breathed a sigh of relief. He had just used brain waves to watch the battle. He directly used brain waves to connect the nerves of Ah Nuan girl's body. Then he saw the differentiated shadow of Ah Nuan girl was fighting with Fenmu Shen battle scene.</p>

    <p>Everything was working fine originally. The result was just that second.</p>

    <p>After Fenmu Shen smiled evilly, this neural link was forced to be interrupted.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling. Something seems wrong..." Wang Ming said while rubbing his head.</p>

    <p>He saw that Wang Ling was sitting cross-legged in the corner of the lounge. His soul had already left his body and he was wandering in the sky.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help laughing: "It seems that someone is more anxious than I thought."</p>

    <p>However, the words were not finished. It only lasted for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling retracted his thoughts and opened his eyes again.</p>

    <p>The reason was that Ah Nuan wanted to fight again. He drove him back...</p>

    <p>"He is an eternal warrior after all. His combat experience is not comparable to that of Ah Nuan. You shouldn't pamper her so much. Besides, that person has already learned Shadow... his abilities and room for growth are beyond our imagination." Wang Ming was obviously worried.</p>

    <p>"It's okay."Wang Ling shook his head and said.</p>

    <p>He had just been in a state of wandering. Although he was driven back by Ah Nuan girl, he also made a basic assessment of the battle situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen did indeed learn Shadow in a very short period of time. And it is true that he tried to use Shadow to unlock the shadow space.</p>

    <p>The learning ability exceeds all opponents Wang Ling has encountered before.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen actually didn't realize what kind of opponent he was facing...</p>

    <p>There is more to Dao than imitation.</p>

    <p>Although some people are born with Heavenly Dao, the existence of Heavenly Dao itself, the order and laws established behind it are all determined by the original creator.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Nuan is the founder of Shadow.</p>

    <p>Then you have supreme authority.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Fenmu Shen is learned, it will be useless.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>It can be confiscated.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Of course. In the above order and rules.</p>

    <p>There is only one person in the universe that can be ignored.</p>

    <p>And this person is Wang Ling.</p>
