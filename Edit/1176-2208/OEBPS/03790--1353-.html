  <h1>Chapter 1353 Boss Sun's self-positioning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi didn't expect that the truth of the matter would be like this.</p>

    <p>He turned out to be the child of Liu Qingyi's shadow...</p>

    <p>Regarding this result, Gu Shunzhi's mood immediately became complicated after hearing it.</p>

    <p>Even if the shadow awakens spiritual wisdom, it is also a thing transformed from the original body. Since it is such an original body, then in fact Liu Qingyi's shadow can also be called Liu Qingyi's "daughter."</p>

    <p>So under this layer of relationship, the relationship between him and Liu Qingyi's ontology seems to become more complicated.</p>

    <p>Previously, Gu Shunzhi had always regarded Liu Qingyi's identity as "mother."</p>

    <p>In fact, he should have called "Grandma"???</p>

    <p>"You seem to be feeling very complicated."</p>

    <p>At this time, the book of Sage Immortal said: "But, this is not incomprehensible. After all, my mother suddenly became my grandmother. There is always a sense of gap. You'd better be more open-minded. Having an elder in the family is like having a treasure. Well."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Returning to life in the cadre apartment that day, Gu Shunzhi had just arrived at the door and found Liu Qingyi holding Wang Zhen's arm, talking and laughing, waiting at the elevator door.</p>

    <p>The two of them traveled lightly and looked as if they were getting ready to go out. They interacted intimately.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi hesitated to speak.</p>

    <p>Mainly I am torn between the two names "grandma" and "mom." I don't know which one is better.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I know everything, Brother Gu. Don't be sad." At this time, Wang Zhen raised his head and looked at Gu Shunzhi. He patted Gu Shunzhi's shoulder sympathetically.</p>

    <p>Although Gu Shunzhi has the status of being an orderly person, when they usually live together in Wei Zhi's house, Gu Shunzhi does not have any airs. Therefore, Wang Zhen and Gu Shunzhi are also considered brothers.</p>

    <p>And now, Gu Shunzhi stared at "Grandpa" who called him brother in front of him. His mood became even more complicated.</p>

    <p>"What do you know?"</p>

    <p>"That's what Qingyi said. You have a serious Oedipus complex." Wang Zhen said.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Now that Qingyi and I are together, I will definitely keep this matter secret. I won't tell others." Wang Zhen said: "Orders are under a lot of pressure. It's normal to have some quirks. I heard my father say that before. There have been even stranger cases."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"There is a man of order who has been single for a long time. He can look at the shadow with a pretty face. He can actually have desire for the shadow of a woman!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi didn't want to continue discussing this topic. He quickly changed the subject: "Where are you going now?"</p>

    <p>"That's it. I, Qingyi, have discussed it. I plan to go out and look at the house and move out."</p>

    <p>"You have money?"</p>

    <p>"Qingyi is now Miss Sun Rong's master! Miss Sun said it. As long as it is a real estate property owned by the Huaguo Shuilian Group, just tell her which one you like."</p>

    <p>"Then... I wish you happiness." Gu Shunzhi said.</p>

    <p>Then, he walked towards his bedroom without looking back.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, he shouldn't be in such a depressed mood.</p>

    <p>Now that he knows that his mother is not Liu Qingyi, he should be happy.</p>

    <p>However, today, too many things happened, and the amount of information was too large...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi felt a little indigestion for a while.</p>

    <p>"What happened to him?"</p>

    <p>Faced with Gu Shunzhi's reaction, Wang Zhen was a little confused.</p>

    <p>"The three of us are from God's Domain after all. But we just left now. Isn't it bad to leave him here?" Liu Qingyi asked worriedly.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Then just find him a roommate." Wang Zhen said.</p>

    <p>"You said...Zhao Qingxian?"</p>

    <p>"Anyway, we have moved out now. And we are already together. So there is nothing to be afraid of."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen suddenly embraced Liu Qingyi, circling her like a giant wolf dog: "This fatso has never been an orderly person in the Divine Realm. Old Gu is at least an Orderer. Under the watchful eye of the Orderer. I don't think Zhao Qingxian will go too far."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. You're right." Liu Qingyi nodded.</p>

    <p>"And I remember. The Zhao family also runs a beast workshop in the God's Domain! They can also help Wei Zhi! At least it's much better than the two of us with two swords!" Wang Zhen said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Where is Zhao Qingxian now?"</p>

    <p>"I asked about him before. Because he is a gangster and his behavior is suspicious. He is still squatting in the detention center."</p>

    <p>"Okay! I'll call Rongrong later and ask her to arrange for someone to bring Zhao Qingxian here."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to eat at night? Western or Chinese?" Wang Zhen asked.</p>

    <p>"Anything is fine!" Liu Qingyi smiled.</p>

    <p>"What about...barbecue?"</p>

    <p>"It's too greasy. Is there anything else?"</p>

    <p>"hot pot?"</p>

    <p>"It's so boring to eat hot pot. It just tastes like the sauce."</p>

    <p>"Then you say..."</p>

    <p>"Anything works!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thursday, December 3rd.</p>

    <p>This is the day Sun Rong is officially discharged from hospital.</p>

    <p>At Sun Rong's own request, the old man chose to deal with it in a low-key manner. There was no big deal. Nor did he recruit a bunch of media reporters to hold a press conference like in the past.</p>

    <p>After experiencing this incident, Mr. Boss Sun really felt that his precious granddaughter seemed to have matured a lot.</p>

    <p>Things have become more steady.</p>

    <p>"It is said that classmate Wang Ling likes to keep a low profile. I'm afraid Rongrong has also been influenced by classmate Wang Ling." In the car, Mr. Sun, the boss, was actually very pleased.</p>

    <p>Everyone has a time when they are young.</p>

    <p>Under the basic conditions of love, your behavior will be aligned with the person you like, and then some changes will occur.</p>

    <p>For example, if a person who is not good at studying falls in love with a top student, he may become much more diligent in his studies.</p>

    <p>Try to stay in step with the person you like. This is also a science in love.</p>

    <p>So regarding Sun Rong pursuing Wang Ling. Mr. Boss Sun is also very clear about his positioning.</p>

    <p>He can only be a remote assistant. He cannot interfere too much.</p>

    <p>Let alone rely on the financial power of your own group to disturb the life of classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>This will not only cause trouble to Wang Ling. It will also hinder his precious granddaughter's plan!</p>

    <p>"Come on Rongrong!" Mr. Boss Sun watched the girl walk into the villa. He couldn't help but cheer in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Sir, where are we going now?"</p>

    <p>"Go to the Office of Strategic Deception. I have an appointment with Director Zhuo."</p>

    <p>"Okay." The driver nodded. He stepped on the accelerator and drove away quickly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Returning to his bedroom. Sun Rong saw that all the furniture that had been burned by the "Great Sacrifice Technique" had been restored. It was the same as before when he left. They were all newly bought.</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu knew that Sun Rong was discharged from the hospital today. She ordered the exact same furniture in advance and had people come to install it overnight.</p>

    <p>"Thank you Aunt Qiu."Sun Rong smiled politely at Aunt Qiu.</p>

    <p>"Miss, you are serious. These are all things I should do. I have other things to be busy with. If you need anything else, miss, just call me."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>She saw Aunt Qiu retreat respectfully and close the door.</p>

    <p>He couldn't wait to open his computer.</p>

    <p>There are too many things recorded in the cloud disk.</p>

    <p>The girl finished watching less than 10% of the film while in the hospital.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>Those. In the state of her soul.</p>

    <p>She personally recorded every bit of her memories in the "little notebook."</p>

    <p>In an instant, everything was released...</p>
