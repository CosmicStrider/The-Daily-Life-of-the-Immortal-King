  <h1>Chapter 2059 Qiao Yanyuan's first appearance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Close to the Great Sering Sea southeast of Mixiu Country Fuye Island. There is a mysterious triangle area.</p>

    <p>For many cultivators on Earth, this is a restricted area for navigation. Due to the existence of special magnetic field interference, countless ships once lost their way here and even disappeared directly in the fog.</p>

    <p>The most famous incident is the legend that the black cruise ship Satan completely disappeared in the Triangle a thousand years ago.</p>

    <p>After the Satan disappeared that year, Mixiu Country collaborated with neighboring cultivating countries to form a fleet to conduct a blanket search and rescue in this sea area. However, no trace of the Satan was found.</p>

    <p>It was not until 666 years later that the Satan suddenly appeared on the coast of Puye Island.</p>

    <p>What's even more surprising is that when the Satan was discovered, the entire hull was as new as before. There was no trace of the baptism of time at all.</p>

    <p>However, the crew members trapped on the Satan and the captain at the time were all reduced to corpses...</p>

    <p>This incident caused a great sensation at that time. It was even listed as one of the top ten unsolved mysteries in the world of cultivation today.</p>

    <p>Even though there is various direct or indirect evidence that the Satan incident is indeed true, there are still many experts in the field of cultivation who believe that all this is a story fabricated by Mixiu Country in order to promote the tourism industry of Puye Island.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether the story is true or not. This restricted area of navigation in the Daxiling Sea has become a nightmare among contemporary cultivators. No one knows what will happen if they insist on going their own way to enter the restricted area. No one would have imagined that at this moment, a ship that is completely emitting The Moonlight ship, illuminated by the bright moonlight, was circling the famous triangle area unscrupulously.</p>

    <p>No one would have expected that this Moonlight was the base camp on earth that Bai Zhe took the lead to set up for his son Bai Zijing - the Honghuang Headquarters.</p>

    <p>In the captain's cabin of the Moonlight, a handsome young man with side-parted hair is flipping through the files in front of him. He has dark purple to black hair, which makes his skin appear fairer against the background of his hair color. Just on his forehead At the position, there is a pair of gold and silver dragon horns. The one on the left is gold and the one on the right is silver.</p>

    <p>His name is Qiao Yanyuan. He is exactly what Bai named before. He is the second chess piece placed on the earth since Mingyue Ye. Once Mingyue Ye is killed in battle, he will directly come out to take charge of the Mingyue ship. He will be in charge of all matters in the prehistoric era and has the right to act on his own initiative. All decisions do not need to be reported to Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>An old man in white robes had been waiting at the door of the captain's cabin for a long time. Qiao Yanyuan read the last page of the file left on the bright moon night. He sat on the recliner relaxedly and snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>The old man received the instruction and tiptoed into the captain's cabin. He stood in front of the desk and saluted respectfully to the current manager of the Great Desolation: "Mr. Qiao, I came here to do Qu Shuling's business. So far, it's going well. Good luck."</p>

    <p>"He has hatred and unwillingness. Only with this emotion can he digest the dragon scales given to him by the Moon Lord." Qiao Yanyuan stood up. He was wearing a straight suit, showing his extraordinary magnanimity as a dragonborn.</p>

    <p>Such a young face exudes a terrifying aura.</p>

    <p>The old man was terrified. He was an Eternal One who was forced to join the Great Desolate World. Because he signed a contract with Bai Zhe, he could only serve Bai Zhe wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>His past identity is no longer important because Bai Zhe gave him a new name: Bai Yinshou.</p>

    <p>The surname Bai means that he is already a servant accepted by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>The silver character in the middle symbolizes the seniority of the servant. This is arranged according to the eight characters "Galaxy in the sky. Dragon travels around the world."</p>

    <p>As for the last birthday, I heard that Bai Zhe randomly named it through the automatic naming software after inputting the first two characters.</p>

    <p>Today, Bai Yinshou's realm remains at the ninth level of Dao God. However, standing in front of Qiao Yanyuan, he still feels like his soul has been lost.</p>

    <p>It is said that Qiao Yanyuan's strength is stronger than that of Jingze and Yan? combined. Bai Yinshou has also met the two dragonborns. He was lucky enough to observe the competition between the two. At that time, Bai Yinshou felt that even his own breathing was weak. Being completely suppressed. I can't even stand still...</p>

    <p>Now when facing Qiao Yanyuan, it was just a normal face-to-face communication, but it was already filled with the illusion that the whole person was being manipulated.</p>

    <p>"Through the dragon scales of the Moon Lord, this Qu Shuling is still the first person to transform into a dragon descendant. All experimental data on him must be recorded closely." Qiao Yanyuan said after staring at Bai Yinshou for a while.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Bai Yinshou nodded. He knelt down.</p>

    <p>"So based on the current progress, how long will it take before he officially becomes a Dragonborn?"</p>

    <p>"Go back to Mr. Qiao. According to the current progress, it only takes three days."</p>

    <p>"Three days? It's very fast."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan nodded: "I'll leave this matter to you. I have other things to deal with."</p>

    <p>He didn't deliberately avoid talking about Bai Yinshou. As soon as he finished speaking, he directly placed his hand with clear finger bones on the astrolabe in front of his desk.</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou knows. This is the spiritual in-body amplification weapon specially given to Qiao Yanyuan by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the monk's soul cannot be too far away from the body. If it is too far away from the body, the combat power of the soul will be greatly weakened. Moreover, it is also easy to suffer from external interference that prevents the soul from returning to the body.</p>

    <p>But with this augmented astrolabe, Qiao Yanyuan can use the separation of his soul to move freely in the cosmic space outside the earth without leaving the earth.</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou was shocked in his heart. The Dragonborn were too strong. They were simply invincible... His time with Qiao Yanyuan was not too long, but it was not short either. So far, Qiao Yanyuan has not exposed his strength.</p>

    <p>Just from the gold and silver horns on his head, it is difficult to tell what kind of dragon warrior genes Qiao Yanyuan has inherited from the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy. Holy Clan Temple.</p>

    <p>When Qiao Yanyuan's soul broke into this place, the saint creatures with golden swirling faces were panicked for a while. But they quickly calmed down after seeing the dragon horns above Qiao Yanyuan's head.</p>

    <p>Because he knew that this was a dragonborn. And he must be someone sent from Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>"Sir, it would be too rude to break into our Holy Clan's temple." said the Saint creature with a golden swirl-like face. He is the Holy Clan's Holy Lord and the first minister under the Holy King's throne.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was holding a scepter and the white robe on his body was moving automatically without any wind. He was trying to use his spiritual pressure to give Qiao Yanyuan a blow.</p>

    <p>It's just a soul that has separated from its true body. He doesn't think that a soul, no matter how powerful it is, can do anything in the sky.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In an instant, Dao Ancestor-level spiritual pressure dropped.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan's expression did not change. He was as calm as ever. He walked directly along the red carpet of the temple and walked easily to the largest leader of the Holy Clan.</p>

    <p>He never knelt down. www.uukanshu.net He just looked at the man in front of him who was wearing golden unicorn armor and an eternal cloak: "Holy King of the Holy Race, my soul left my body this time. I have no ill intentions. I just want to do something for the sake of our relationship." cooperation. Add some trust."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by Mr. Qiao's words?" The Holy King narrowed his eyes. He already knew the origin of the person in front of him.</p>

    <p>I even know that Qiao Yanyuan's true body is actually on the earth.</p>

    <p>From the temple of the Infinite Galaxy on Earth...such a long distance. Unexpectedly, there is no fear of the spiritual pressure of the Dao Ancestor realm...</p>

    <p>This person's strength can only be described as terrifying.</p>

    <p>Even Qiao Yanyuan's strength is like this. Sooner or later, Bai Zhe will become the world's number one immortal...</p>

    <p>"Didn't the Holy King realize that your Holy Clan was tricked?" At this time, Qiao Yanyuan narrowed his eyes slightly and asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>Ps: For a review of the past, please see Chapter 1998: Really inserted an eye</p>
