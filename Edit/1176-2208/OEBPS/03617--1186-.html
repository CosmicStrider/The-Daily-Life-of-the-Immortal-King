  <h1>Chapter 1186 Demonic Shadows</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue didn't expect that she would be defeated in this way by an enemy she didn't want to lose the most. In a completely claustrophobic space, no light could penetrate. The slippery and sticky space spirit fluid under her feet was even more intense. A thick layer of haze enveloped Jiang Yingyue's psychology.</p>

    <p>"I will take you down. You seem unwilling?" After swallowing Jiang Yingyue, Er Ha was also paying attention to Jiang Yingyue's reaction. He had no doubt that the other party was planning a plan to escape from the space.</p>

    <p>What needs to be done now is to be more vigilant. Don't let Jiang Yingyue find any opportunities.</p>

    <p>"How many masters are there in this stalactite cave?" Er Ha transformed himself into a human form again and asked Jiang Liuying about the situation.</p>

    <p>His special space was personally arranged by Wang Ling. It is isolated from all external information factors. It is no different from a small black hole. Jiang Yingyue is imprisoned in his heart and is completely isolated from the outside world. He has entered another dimension. Medium. Only Er Ha's voice can be heard.</p>

    <p>"Do you think I'm someone who would betray others?"</p>

    <p>"You don't need to tell me the information about the people behind the scenes. You only need other people's information. I need to know their abilities and methods of defeating the enemy. We can study it ourselves." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"So. What's the difference between this and collaboration with the enemy?" Jiang Yingyue sneered.</p>

    <p>"Do you really want to rely on the person who helped you resurrect? He is a traitor who disobeys Heavenly Dao. He acts against heaven and will suffer divine punishment sooner or later." Er Ha calmly analyzed Jiang Yingyue, "You stay here. It is absolutely safe." Even if the person behind the scenes is punished by Heavenly Dao... all the resurrected people will disappear. As long as you stay here, you can save your life. And I promise you another condition."</p>

    <p>It is said that if you know yourself and your enemy, you will never be defeated in a hundred battles. We still don't know how many enemies there are in the other side's camp. Er Ha feels that choosing this time to win over Jiang Yingyue is an excellent opportunity. And he has a trump card in his hand that Jiang Yingyue cannot refuse.</p>

    <p>"I am also a person who has seen the world. Ordinary conditions are not effective for me." In the space, Jiang Yingyue gently rotated the umbrella handle and opened the umbrella. She crossed her legs and gently raised her buttocks to sit on the umbrella. The whole person levitated. Leaving the ground.</p>

    <p>"If I say that the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother you saw is fake, can you believe it?" At this time, Er Ha continued to speak.</p>

    <p>"False? This is impossible! She is so strong! And so intellectual and elegant..."</p>

    <p>"As you said. She is an intellectual and elegant woman. Do you think such a person will be addicted to material things? Will she be obsessed with money?"</p>

    <p>These words made Jiang Yingyue fall into deep thought. In fact... this matter is indeed a bit strange. Such behavior as charging tuition is not in line with the character of Ghost Ax Spirit Mother.</p>

    <p>This is the person she admires most in her life. If the enemy she has paid so much for tuition is still a fake, it will be a lifelong regret for her.</p>

    <p>"What kind of person is the real Ghost Ax Spirit Mother?"</p>

    <p>"A more powerful being than the fake you see. She is a person with a strong heart." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Over there. Jiang Yingyue thought hard for a moment, "Do you dare to swear on everything you said?"</p>

    <p>"The inner demon's oath is not reliable. If you feel that I lied to you, I can swear it."</p>

    <p>"That's all. There's no need to go to such trouble. I can trust you once. But I'm only responsible for the capability information I know." Jiang Yingyue took a deep breath and gave her final answer.</p>

    <p>She didn't care at all what the person behind her resurrection had planned.</p>

    <p>But meeting the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is indeed what Jiang Yingyue wants to do most at the moment.</p>

    <p>She told herself in her heart that if she couldn't see the idol of her dreams, even if she was given a chance to live again, it would only be a regret after all.</p>

    <p>We successfully entered the second area of the stalactite cave. The humidity in the cave is heavier. The walls are covered with mushrooms of various colors. These mushrooms are colorful and emit weak fluorescence. At first glance, they are highly poisonous and cannot be eaten.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen discovered an old four-legged furnace tripod. The surface of the furnace tripod had been affected by the moisture in the stalactite cave and had become rusty.</p>

    <p>Opening the stove, Wang Zhen reached out and touched the embers in the stove. He put two fingers together in front of the tip of his nose and sniffed, "This stove was last used a month ago."</p>

    <p>"Can you smell this?" In the chat channel, Xiao Yin was surprised by Wang Zhen's sense of smell. Logically speaking, this should be Er Ha's job.</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen is absolutely right." Er Ha also took a whiff and said, "The elixir is made from nearby fluorescent mushrooms. It can be used to relieve moisture in the body."</p>

    <p>Judging from the clues collected so far, Huang Lao is actually a very particular person. Cultivators... especially elderly cultivators are still very afraid of moisture entering the body. The moisture in the cultivation world is unusual. Once the body is wet Excessive Qi will cause the meridians to be frozen, affecting the output of spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>Mr. Huang has been stationed in the stalactite cave in Jiulong Mountain all year round. Naturally, he also knows how to use the natural resources here to eliminate dampness. He is a very particular old man.</p>

    <p>"Living here for a long time. This level of dampness and poison must be discharged at least once a week..." Wang Zhen frowned. The last time this alchemy furnace was used was a month ago. In other words, it is possible that the real Huang Laozao I was transferred a month ago.</p>

    <p>After thinking about this matter carefully, Wang Zhen suddenly felt a sense of fear. If Mr. Huang had been transferred as early as a month ago, then the enemy would most likely adopt a coordinated action method... In other words. It is very likely that all their current actions are within the control of the other party!</p>

    <p>Because of his combat experience in the divine realm, Wang Zhen suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Do you feel it?" Jiang Yingyue sighed softly in the space, "I think the three of you might not even be able to get through the second area."</p>

    <p>These "resurrectors" arranged in the stalactite cave are ranked according to their comprehensive combat power. The later the resurrectors are, the stronger they are. Solving the problem alone does not explain the problem.</p>

    <p>In fact, if we look at realm strength alone, Jiang Yingyue's ranking can be ranked in the top three of the resurrected. But if the power of "Shadow" is added, this ranking will have to be reset.</p>

    <p>Some of the shadow abilities are so disgusting that even Jiang Yingyue herself can't stand it. Her shadow bomb seems to be very perverted. However, it has the fatal weakness of being easy to reset and having a short range. Once seen through, it will be the opposite. It will become easier to deal with.</p>

    <p>"Here we come." At this time, in the claustrophobic space, Jiang Yingyue opened her slender eyes. She felt a familiar breath.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>"The seventh person among the resurrected is Li Huanran. His image is called Demonic Shadow."</p>

    <p>"There are many shadows?"</p>

    <p>"It's dangerous. Be careful."</p>
