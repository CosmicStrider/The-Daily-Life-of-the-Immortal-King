  <h1>Chapter 1241 Queuing for Detection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's move can be described as unprepared and unexpected.</p>

    <p>The various forces that previously competed for Keorn. Except for the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shuilian Group, the other two parties have also fallen into a temporary stagnation.</p>

    <p>"Bald Virus. What is this..." In the castle, Xu Bai vaguely felt that there was something wrong with this matter, but he couldn't tell what was wrong.</p>

    <p>He asked the Lord of the Void for instructions. The answer the Lord gave him was:</p>

    <p>This can be used as a cover to accelerate the void invasion plan.</p>

    <p>Let more ethereal spirits join the action. Go find the people they want to find.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai, who was originally a human being, had some doubts about the Lord of the Void for the first time. But he did not dare to disobey the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>It was the Lord of the Void who gave him everything.</p>

    <p>Since I can give it to him, if he becomes unhappy, he will take it back.</p>

    <p>At this time, Xu Bai discovered for the first time a drawback of Xu Ling as a higher creature.</p>

    <p>That is because they are used to living a carefree life in the empty world. They have never experienced the deception, lies, and intrigues of the human world...</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this group of void spirits, including the Lord of the Void, are a group of "honest people" through and through.</p>

    <p>Now Xubai can only pray that things can continue to be realized according to the established plan. This so-called "bald virus storm" must not be a moth.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The baldness storm swept across the world in just one morning and became a hot topic among the people.</p>

    <p>How to prevent such terrible influenza viruses has suddenly become the focus of discussion among all cultivators.</p>

    <p>Some experts say that washing hands and wearing a mask is not enough. This is because the baldness virus can also be transmitted through contact. For example, being touched on the head by someone who has been infected with the baldness virus can also cause scalp hair loss...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows that this is of course unreliable nonsense.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Some people really believe this kind of unreliable news.</p>

    <p>Take Number 60 High School as an example. That afternoon, an epidemic prevention team composed of the Xiuzhen Police Department and the local health department came to Number 60 High School. They took away several teachers with bald heads for investigation.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong and the epidemic prevention personnel wearing thick protective clothing repeatedly explained: "Brother, I am really not sick... I have less hair to begin with!"</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, Lao Gudong even had the urge to restore his true form as "Gorgeous itinerant."</p>

    <p>I think of him in Gorgeous itinerant form. But with flowing waist-length hair...</p>

    <p>This feeling of being misunderstood is really uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>But the epidemic prevention personnel did not listen to the explanation at all. The instructions they received were that they would rather kill everyone by mistake than let anyone go.</p>

    <p>"This teacher asks you to cooperate with the work first. We will take you to the testing point later. If it is confirmed that there is no problem, you can leave on the same day. Now, please cooperate to get in the van..."</p>

    <p>The attitude of the epidemic prevention personnel is very firm.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong had no choice but to cooperate.</p>

    <p>The back of the van has been expanded.</p>

    <p>When Lao Gudong entered, he found that the space had been divided into several single-person areas.</p>

    <p>This is a separate design to prevent cross-infection.</p>

    <p>"Brothers, where did you come from?" Lao Gudong got close to the people next to him through the transparent space wall.</p>

    <p>"Hey. My name is Shiraishi Xiu. I am a monk."</p>

    <p>"My name is Pipitu. I am a short, bald author..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As suspected cases from various places were taken away for testing, epidemic prevention work was carried out in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>The matter was not over after Lao Gudong was taken away. Everyone was notified to stay in school before the end of school. It was said that a school-wide screening was to be conducted.</p>

    <p>Every student, teacher, and school employee must be checked. No one can escape.</p>

    <p>And the way to check is also very simple.</p>

    <p>Just spray the test reagent on your head.</p>

    <p>As long as there is no large-scale hair loss, it proves that you are not infected with the "virus." You can directly receive a free mask and go home.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent cross-infection, testing is conducted on a class-by-class basis. All classes whose numbers are called will gather at the entrance of the gymnasium. Temporary testing points have been set up inside.</p>

    <p>When it was Number 60 High School's turn to wait, Wang Ling blinked and stared at Class 2, where Fang Xing was in front.</p>

    <p>So far, all detections are normal. No abnormal phenomena have occurred. According to Wang Ling's knowledge, the number of void invasions is still very limited. Number 60 High School It is a small probability event for someone to be invaded by voids.</p>

    <p>Void spirits need hosts with strong physical fitness. Generally speaking, they will not focus on students who are only in the Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p>In the front, Class 2, led by the head teacher Liu Ruoxu, is doing an inspection.</p>

    <p>This teacher Liu teaches mathematics. He also taught the class of Wang Ling before. He is proficient in calculation. He is a master at the peak of the late Golden Core. He can become the head teacher of the elite class. It proves that Teacher Liu does have two qualities. The one who puts the brush in.</p>

    <p>There are actually not many good-looking female teachers in the school. Teacher Pan is one, and Teacher Liu is another.</p>

    <p>"Do you feel that the quality of Teacher Liu's teaching has become higher and higher recently?"</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Teacher Pan is having a headache over this matter." Guo Hao said: "Do you remember the test two days ago? Our class and Class 2 took the joint examination. In the end, our average score was ten points behind Class 2."</p>

    <p>"Is it the period of rest after our national competition?" Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>"Yeah! Teacher Pan is so angry! Even if a few of us didn't take the exam, it's a bit unreasonable that the other people's scores are 10 points different from the average score of Class 2... Otherwise, Su Xiao was in front to pull the points. The gap is probably even bigger."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed and said: "And it's not just the written test scores that are poor. Our class's experimental scores are also lagging behind. Using an induction cooker to make elixirs can blow up the furnace. They are also talented people... Adjust the formula according to the proportion. Add water to it and it will be over?"</p>

    <p>When he said this, Guo Hao deliberately spoke in a low voice. He only complained to Chen Chao. Although he was telling the truth, if other students heard it, it would easily affect the unity of the class.</p>

    <p>According to Guo Hao, Teacher Liu Ruoxu seems to have become enlightened in teaching recently. He has found new teaching methods, allowing the students in Class 2 to learn new knowledge faster.</p>

    <p>Previously, the class of Wang Ling was in the lead. This sudden fall behind naturally hit Teacher Pan hard.</p>

    <p>In just ten minutes, Fang Xing's class, led by Liu Ruoxu, the second class teacher, completed all inspections.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Liu Ruoxu was stopped by an inspector: "Teacher, please take a test too."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Teacher Liu sat down cooperatively.</p>

    <p>The inspector squirted the test spray on Teacher Liu Ruoxu's head.</p>

    <p>Then... a scene that horrified everyone happened...</p>

    <p>Teacher Liu Ruoxu, who used to have a full head of hair, suddenly changed her face drastically. She seemed to be in great pain! Her face began to become ferocious and distorted. She couldn't help but pick her scalp with her hands!</p>

    <p>Large swathes of hair fell off naturally or were torn off by her out of control... In less than a few dozen seconds, all of Teacher Liu Ruoxu's hair had fallen out!</p>

    <p>"Quick! Control her!"</p>

    <p>The epidemic prevention personnel and the surrounding students and teachers were all shocked.</p>

    <p>The crazy teacher Liu Ruoxu has completely lost control!</p>

    <p>Boom! A sound!</p>

    <p>She kicked the ground violently and flew out quickly, smashing through the ceiling of the gymnasium.</p>

    <p>A pair of red high heels were dug into the gym floor like nails.</p>

    <p>This virtual spirit seems to want to escape.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling will not make this virtual spirit so happy.</p>

    <p>Just use {Great Gravity}.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made a decision immediately. He wanted to use gentle spells as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Under the condition of not harming Teacher Liu's body, let Teacher Liu stay.</p>

    <p>But at the next moment, a huge light flashed across the sky...</p>

    <p>A meteorite fell from the sky from the distant starry sky! Right opposite the Number 60 High School gymnasium!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes twitched. He controlled his strength as much as possible. But it seemed that he still used too much force...</p>
