  <h1>Chapter 1178 Three Men-style Brothers</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This sword. Zaomen Rokuro is extremely confident.</p>

    <p>His katana is called "Yougang." It is made of the cold iron of the abyss of the Howling Abyss. It is indestructible! If his prediction of the Seven Kills is really wrong, he can definitely cut off Er Ha's dog head!</p>

    <p>However, it turned out that his prediction was obviously wrong.</p>

    <p>The power of this sword was of no use to Er Ha. He didn't even feel the slightest pain. His green hair fell back against the strong wind of the sword energy and floated in the wind...</p>

    <p>"This!" This is the first time Zaomen Rokuro has faced this situation.</p>

    <p>In the case of unequal strength, Zaomen Rokuro's chance of winning against anyone is very slim. Now that Wang Zhen and the others have gained the power of Shadow, this sword is naturally impossible to cause any harm.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Zaomen Rokuro also lost his Yougang Sword in it.</p>

    <p>"My Yougang... My Yougang is extremely sharp. It can cut iron like clay, the blade is sharp, and the hilt can be used for my girlfriend..." Part of the Yougang Sword. Zaomen Rokuro cried heartbrokenly. The Dark Steel Sword has been with him for many years. The first thing he did after his resurrection was to find his own Dark Steel.</p>

    <p>But what Zaomen Rokuro didn't expect was that the Yougang Sword in his hand hadn't completely warmed up yet. It actually split into two pieces due to his misjudgment.</p>

    <p>When the sword broke, the spiritual connection with the sword master was instantly cut off. Zaomen Rokuro felt like his heart was cut by a knife for a moment. He couldn't help but cough up a large mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>The pain of the backlash is far more powerful than imagined. It is a severe pain originating from the soul. When the pain starts, you can't even find any wounds. You can only feel the qi and blood surging in the body, and a splitting headache.</p>

    <p>"You... will never beat the master..." After saying that, Zaomen Rokuro stabbed himself in the abdomen with the remaining half of Yougang. After confirming his death, his body scattered on the spot and turned into a pool of black light. Grains of powder are scattered in the wind.</p>

    <p>Did he actually choose to commit suicide?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen pinched his chin and thought about the situation that was happening in front of him. A powerful swordsman like Zaomen Rokuro, who was extremely wanted on the dark web, would never choose to commit suicide because of the severe backlash.</p>

    <p>To be able to reach such a wanted level, both his cultivation experience and combat experience are second to none. He would not choose to commit suicide in order to alleviate the pain.</p>

    <p>So Wang Zhen immediately thought of another possibility.</p>

    <p>In an independent mental space, Wang Zhen, Xiao Yin, and Er Ha established a face-to-face communication channel. In this completely isolated mental space, all the information they communicate will not be heard by outsiders.</p>

    <p>"It's a fake death." Wang Zhen quickly made a judgment. He did not use any magic skills or his own eye power. Instead, he made a judgment entirely based on his own experience.</p>

    <p>"Why are you so sure?" Er Ha asked. As a person who once pretended to die in front of Wang Ling... Er Ha is particularly sensitive to the word "faking death."</p>

    <p>Pretending to be dead and then taking the opportunity to escape is a profound skill and knowledge. In the world of cultivation, the method of pretending to die can be used in combination with various spells.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has seen a spell specially developed for cheating death. It is specifically called: {Fragmentation}. During the operation of this spell, the body can be split into countless fragments of different sizes. Finally, the jigsaw puzzle method is used to reconnect.</p>

    <p>This is a very good trick to cheat death.</p>

    <p>Of course, the required proficiency is also very high. Generally, you need to practice at home to reach the corresponding proficiency before you can put it into normal use. Because if you are not proficient, you will spell the wrong part.</p>

    <p>And once you spell it wrong, you can only wait until the next time the spiritual energy accumulation is completed to cast the spell again and spell it again. There once was a male cultivator who turned into a little elephant man because he spelled his part wrongly.</p>

    <p>And if you want to use this spell during the battle, if you are unskilled, it is very likely that the enemy will see through it due to uneven splitting. It is very likely that you will be "whipped", thereby destroying the integrity of the fragments.</p>

    <p>"I know a curse-type suspended animation technique. It can be achieved by hurting oneself. These people commit suicide to bless their remaining soul power to a specific person. And this specific person must be a blood relative."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "In other words. Zaomen Rokuro has brothers?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded: "According to the information, Zaomen Rokuro does have brothers. And the three brothers are all very strong swordsmanship practitioners. It's a pity that Zaomen Rokuro's aura was too big back then. As a result, their other two brothers were buried."</p>

    <p>"Is there such a thing? He has two brothers?"</p>

    <p>"One is called Kaimen Qilang. The other is Yimen Jiulang."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Wang Zhen is indeed Wang Zhen. As a person from the God Realm, he can identify this spell of suspended animation at a glance. As expected, they have not yet stepped into the stalactites. A middle-aged man who looks exactly like Zaomen Rokuro walked out of the cave wearing the same clothes.</p>

    <p>The only difference is that the sword in his hand is obviously different from the Yougang that Zaomen Rokuro took out earlier.</p>

    <p>Although there is not much difference in appearance, it is obvious that Kamen Shichiro's sword has an evil power attached to it.</p>

    <p>"It seems that their brothers have added all the power of the curse to the spirit sword..." Wang Zhen took a deep breath. Now that it has been confirmed that Zaomen Rokuro has two other brothers, I'm afraid this situation was planned in advance.</p>

    <p>No matter it is Zaomen Rokuro or Shichiro Kamen in front of them, they are not afraid of anger. On the contrary, they can better bless their soul power to other brothers after death.</p>

    <p>So we have to deal with these three brothers. Killing them by normal means will make them stronger.</p>

    <p>"I'll do it." This time, Wang Zhen decided to do it himself. On the one hand, he also wanted to see how strong his Shadow power was.</p>

    <p>Now he still lacks some practical experience. The three Menshi brothers are here. They are undoubtedly the best candidates for practice.</p>

    <p>"The tied man!" The next moment, Wang Zhen stepped forward and called out the name of his Shadow image. When his shadow was activated from the ground, the muscular man with ropes all over his body was like a towering mountain rising from the ground.</p>

    <p>Demimen Qilang was shocked. He did not have the power of Shadow. He did not know what was happening in front of him.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Kaimen Qilang felt his whole body tighten. There was an inexplicable force binding him! This force surrounded him layer by layer, like a rope!</p>

    <p>This is a man's rope that is stronger than gold... as long as it is within the attack range of the shadow. Wang Zhen's shadow is a powerful control spell.</p>

    <p>"You three brothers, where is the third person?" At this time, Wang Zhen stared at Qilang Demimen. The power of photography was actually more handy than he imagined.</p>

    <p>It is worthy of the power of sister Ling Zhenren...</p>

    <p>These brothers and sisters are both geniuses!</p>
