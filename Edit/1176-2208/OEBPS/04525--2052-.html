  <h1>Chapter 2052 Sorry Sun Rong. I demolished your house</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Wangxian Mirror, you may not have thought of it. Just because it peeked into the future of Wang Ling, it caused the mirror to completely collapse.</p>

    <p>After all, this is an antique that has been handed down from the ancient times. The ancestor of the Sun family was able to get such a large piece of glass that can see the future. It is made of mysterious extraterrestrial meteorites. Wang Ling Just by thinking about it, knows how valuable this is.</p>

    <p>So his first reaction was to repair it. Repairing a magical artifact was no more complicated than repairing the terrain. Repairing the terrain was much more difficult than repairing the magical artifact. After all, the magical artifact was just a small thing. The terrain was too vast.</p>

    <p>So after demolishing the Ice Purgatory, Wang Ling did not directly repair it. Partly because he was in a hurry.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he felt that repairing the terrain was too complicated. He was worried that if he started repairing it, he would directly repair the Ice Purgatory into a super terrain that far exceeded the original level of Ice Purgatory.</p>

    <p>As the real head of the Sun family, Mr. Boss Sun will definitely notice something strange once he wakes up.</p>

    <p>So after comprehensive consideration, Wang Ling finally handed over this job to Zhenyuan, a terrain restoration expert.</p>

    <p>However, when it comes to repairing the magic weapon, Wang Ling still has confidence.</p>

    <p>Golden light condensed in his hand. With a fierce operation, he shot out the light beam in his palm.</p>

    <p>In front, the place illuminated by the beam is reorganizing as if it were going back in time. Those split particles flowed back together and finally reassembled into the original form of the Wangxian Mirror.</p>

    <p>There are no cracks on the mirror surface. But Wang Ling can still notice that something is wrong.</p>

    <p>Because this Wangxian Mirror...</p>

    <p>Compared to the original, it has no luster at all.</p>

    <p>"Because the weapon spirit is directly annihilated, so even if the algorithm itself is repaired, it will be useless?" Wang Ying sighed and made his own judgment.</p>

    <p>After the Wangxian Mirror peeked into the future of the Immortal King for just a few seconds, the spirit of the instrument directly paid the price with his own life and walked away peacefully...</p>

    <p>Today's Wangxian Mirror has a dull surface. Even if all the cracks are restored, it still has no original luster. It's like the author's hair that keeps falling from the head of the Mediterranean Sea and gathering at the mouth of the sewer.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if the current Wangxian Mirror looks normal, it actually no longer has the ability to peer into the future.</p>

    <p>The weapon spirit inside has been wiped out...</p>

    <p>Only the passage of life is something that Wang Ling cannot make up for. He had long ago mentioned that it involves the taboo of checks and balances in the universe.</p>

    <p>If he forcibly reverses the situation and resurrects this weapon spirit, it means that there will be other innocent lives under the control of the will of the universe. Perhaps they will die due to disasters or accidents.</p>

    <p>Of course. The Wangxian Mirror is also innocent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has no choice but to find another way to compensate the Sun family.</p>

    <p>After all, he destroyed a magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Just think of other ways to compensate.</p>

    <p>He sighed slightly in his heart. Wang Ling reached out his hand into the Wangxian Mirror. However, something unexpected happened to Wang Ling. The seven-colored light of the Wangxian Mirror should have brought him among the fifth map of the Sun family [Thousands of Thunder Ponds].</p>

    <p>However, when he stepped into the Wangxian Mirror, the tomb passage in front of him was like an imperial mausoleum, which made him slightly distracted for a moment.</p>

    <p>The Wangxian Mirror spirit being gone. This directly led to problems with the map transmission connection!</p>

    <p>In the end, he was sent directly to the Tomb of Zhenshan Knight!</p>

    <p>It can be seen that the statue of the Zunshan Knight is wearing a battle armor and holding a unified sword. Rows of majestic statues stand in the tomb passage.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling changed the ban on the Sun family's ancestral land. This unintentional intrusion did not disturb the thousands of knights who guarded the mountain. Now only Wang Ling remains of the majestic tombs of the knights. The sound of slightly empty footsteps.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling finally knows what it means that curiosity killed the cat...</p>

    <p>After arriving at the Zhenshan Knight's Tomb, it also means that Sun Ru cannot navigate behind it.</p>

    <p>Although she had visited the Sun family's ancestral land with the then head of the Sun family in ancient times, she had to follow the order. Now she accidentally entered the Zhenshan Knight's Tomb. Sun Ru couldn't stop it.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru, can you remember anything? For example, the tomb of Zhenshan Knight. Is there any exit?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"I really don't know..." Sun Ru was helpless: "This is my first time here."</p>

    <p>"Aren't there magical weapons like the Luoyang Shovel and the Dragon-Seeking Ruler..."</p>

    <p>"Heir of Lao Jun. Although this place is indeed called the Tomb of Zhenshan Knight, in the final analysis, it is our Sun family's own home. In our own home, who would prepare these things for fighting!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru. The lesson is..."</p>

    <p>"But I think instead of asking me, you should be able to think of something. You are Lao Jun's successor."</p>

    <p>"I?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that when the ancestors arranged the Sun family's ancestral land, senior Lao Jun helped a lot. Many of the Feng Shui variables and the Heavenly Dao algorithm in the ancestral land were designed by senior Lao Jun. As Lao Jun's successor, you. You should know something about it, right?"</p>

    <p>"..." These words immediately stopped Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Although he is indeed the descendant of Lao Jun, he has not told this matter outside these years. He is afraid that he, the younger generation, will lose the face of his master.</p>

    <p>Although many people know Lao Jun because of his superb alchemy skills, the problem is that the master he knows is an all-rounder.</p>

    <p>Formation, alchemy, feng shui, weapon refining, astrology, As long as it is related to various cultivation skills. His master knows almost everything. He is a true all-rounder.</p>

    <p>After all, Immortal Toya is also very ashamed. In his generation, apart from the skills passed down by his master in alchemy, he is still quite accomplished. Almost all the other skills have become legends recorded in ancient books.</p>

    <p>In those years, Immortal Toya also tried to learn. But sometimes... talent is really the key factor. Without the blessing of talent, no matter how hard you study, you will only be mediocre in the end.</p>

    <p>At best, he is better than an amateur.</p>

    <p>So many years ago, Immortal Toya had already set his goal.</p>

    <p>As a junior, he must at least ensure that Master Lao Jun's alchemy skills will never be lost...</p>

    <p>In recent years, he has been addicted to alchemy and has indeed made many achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to other aspects, Immortal Toya has to admit that he is far inferior to his master.</p>

    <p>Called out!</p>

    <p>Continuing to use the method of shrinking the ground to an inch. Wang Ling ran wildly around the Zhenshan Knight Tomb. Since he could not find any way out, he could only further understand the terrain like this. Then Construct the entire scene of Zhenshan Knight's Tomb in his mind.</p>

    <p>Finally. Wang Ling came to a wall that looked extremely thick with his hands in his pockets. He raised his arms.</p>

    <p>"Master of the family... you should think twice!" Sun Ru seemed to have guessed what Wang Ling was going to do.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. I also think you want to think about it again?" Immortal Toya couldn't help but sweat when he saw Wang Ling raise his hand.</p>

    <p>The scene they were most worried about was going to happen after all...</p>

    <p>We agreed not to cause any trouble to the Sun family!</p>

    <p>In the end, it is inevitable that the house will be demolished!</p>

    <p>"I will make up for it." Wang Ling also had a helpless look on his face. He really didn't want to do that unless he had to.</p>

    <p>But now King's Eyes is temporarily unavailable. He has no other choice. It seems that only using this simple and clear method is the fastest way to explore the path.</p>
