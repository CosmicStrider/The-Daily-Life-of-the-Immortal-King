  <h1>Chapter 1225 Why is Kuxuan so long?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Release him? Why do you ask for his release?</p>

    <p>This incident made both Warden Liang and Lord Diulei feel completely weird. The news that Keorn pretended to be the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother was broadcast to the whole country as an emergency news on Zhenyang Channel tonight. The Office of Strategic Deception is backed by the Huaxiu AllianceGeneral Alliance. The news at night was all arranged by Diulei who found someone from General Alliance in order to announce to other branches that this matter will be taken over by General Alliance.</p>

    <p>But now a mere branch dares to obstruct it. This is simply unbelievable.</p>

    <p>"How interesting. Our operation was not ordered by General Alliance?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"The General Alliance process is complicated. The relevant documents have not yet been approved... Although the Office of Strategic Deception is affiliated with General Alliance, it actually does not have law enforcement authority." Warden Liang patted the table: "This branch is far away from us. It's very close. It's a quick start. Although I don't know who ordered it, it complies with the rules and procedures."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang said this. Lord Diulei felt that this matter was starting to become interesting. Knowing that the matter was about to be taken over by the General Alliance, a branch actually jumped out in advance to obstruct it.</p>

    <p>"The co-leader of a branch does not have the courage. There must be someone behind this matter."</p>

    <p>"Who is the branch leader of Songhai City?"</p>

    <p>"Herman."</p>

    <p>"Why does it sound like a foreigner's name?"</p>

    <p>"He is originally an overseas Chinese. It was only this year that he was transferred to the Huaxiu Alliance branch in Songhai City as the branch co-leader."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang showed the summons he had just received requesting his release. It had the double stamps of the Songhai Huaxiu Alliance branch and the alliance leader Heerman. It was absolutely unmistakable.</p>

    <p>"What is the rank of a joint commander?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"The strength is similar to that of the principals of major cultivation schools. The stronger half has already stepped into True Immortal. But most of them are in the Itinerant Immortal realm. And they are basically in a state where there is no hope of breaking through in their lifetime."</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help but smile when he heard this. It turns out that this is an Itinerant Immortal. You know, True Immortal is almost written down by the author now!</p>

    <p>However, from the tone of Warden Liang, he still felt worried about this matter: "Judging from the attitude in this letter, there must be someone behind the scenes. Otherwise, he would not have the guts as a joint commander."</p>

    <p>"What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"The current joint commander Hermann is completely hostile to us. Even if he is dismissed from his post and imprisoned, he will do his best to prevent Keorn from being captured. It seems that the secrets Keorn holds are very likely to have moved someone. A cake from a big boss. And in our country of Huaxiu, there are only a handful of people with such power..." Warden Liang frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception is not a law enforcement organization. This is a key issue. If there is a conflict between Lord Diulei and the branch in Songhai City at this time, the person who wins in the end will also be the branch.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the overall strength of the branch is not weak. There are twenty groups under one branch. The weakest combat effectiveness is in the Nascent Soul period. The War Bureau has just been established. The number of people seems to be many, but the number of elite soldiers is very small. Below Many of the disciples are doing odd jobs in the Foundation Building period and Golden Core. If there really is a conflict, even if there are a few big bosses sitting in, it will be self-destructive.</p>

    <p>The first level of officialdom kills people. If a Ming sect dares to take action against law enforcement agencies, they will find reasons to kill you from all sides in minutes! Now in the peaceful era, the battles between sects will never be the same as before. Look at each other. If he didn't like it, he would ask several groups of disciples to arrange a fight in front of the mountain gate.</p>

    <p>Trade wars, information wars and public opinion wars... are all ways to overwhelm opponents.</p>

    <p>If the Office of Strategic Deception takes action now and other sects add fuel to the flames, public opinion will definitely be at an overwhelming disadvantage.</p>

    <p>A big tree attracts wind. There are too many sects that want to suppress the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang even suspected that this matter might be a bureau against the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>These days, Lord Diulei's Office of Strategic Deception has been stealing the show in all aspects. Even if it is affiliated to the Huaxiu AllianceGeneral Alliance, is there room for two tigers in this mountain?</p>

    <p>The complexity of this matter has exceeded Warden Liang's imagination: "I'm sorry, Zhenjun. This matter has already been ordered by the branch. I can't disobey the orders of my superiors. Unless there is a notice issued by the General Alliance, otherwise I will not We can no longer detain Keorn..."</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned: "How long can Warden Liang detain him for at most?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang was silent for a moment. He replied: "The order states that he will be released immediately. But including the procedures, I can keep him for another hour at most."</p>

    <p>"Then there is Warden Lao Liang."</p>

    <p>The two of them held each other's fists and bowed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei then quickly left the prison with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>One man and one dog had just left. Warden Liang immediately ordered to the guard next to him: "Go and bring me the 999-question prison satisfaction survey questionnaire."</p>

    <p>"The warden really wants to help him..."</p>

    <p>"What can I do to help? I am also completing the target given to me by my superiors. This is also a task assigned by the joint commander. It is said that the major prisons must meet the human rights of prisoners during their detention. The investigation was carried out. I am also acting in accordance with the order. "Warden Liang finished speaking and left without looking back. He already felt that this matter was very troublesome.</p>

    <p>Now he needs to find someone to calm his thoughts. Whenever he feels depressed, as long as he discusses it with this person, his mood will immediately become better.</p>

    <p>Back to the warden's office. Warden Liang picked up the coffee cup on the table and took a sip. He directly used the communication ball to connect to the Office of the Hundred Schools General Administration: "Hello. I am Lao Liang from Songhai Number 1 Prison. Help me pick up Mr. Zhuo. The department's internal information."</p>

    <p>Although he had already got off work at this time, he knew very well that Zhuo Yi, a workaholic who devoted his life and blood in the workplace, must still stick to his position.</p>

    <p>At this time, Warden Liang was stroking the communication ball and looking out the window.</p>

    <p>His intuition told him that a major earthquake was about to occur in the entire Huaxiu country... even the entire world.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Er Ha left the prison. One person and one dog clearly felt that something was wrong with the atmosphere at this time. Especially when Lord Diulei contacted General Alliance with the Office of Strategic Deception summons specially issued by Huaxiu Alliance. It was so weird. The feeling instantly poured into Lord Diulei's heart.</p>

    <p>General Alliance. No one responded to him. No hang-ups, no calls.</p>

    <p>This is definitely an abnormal signal.</p>

    <p>"No one answered." Er Ha also sensed that something was not right about this matter. From Keorn being caught to the news broadcast on Zhenyang Station. Then to Lord Diulei personally accompanying Warden Liang to hear the case. Then to Songhai City. The branch requested that he be released. The whole process took less than 6 hours.</p>

    <p>Within 6 hours, there was a pair of invisible hands that covered the sky and the sun. They had already made arrangements behind the scenes and controlled everything...</p>

    <p>Who could this person be?</p>

    <p>"Do you have an answer?"</p>

    <p>"There is no conclusive evidence. I can't doubt anyone. And there are more than one people with such power. We need to find out now. What is the other party hiding? What secrets does Keorn have that cannot be told."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about Keorn. I've planted a mark on him. He can't escape," Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded: "Now, let's divide our forces into two groups. I'll take the nearest immortal ship to General Alliance to find someone. You go and contact Zhuo Yi brothers first. In addition, take {{id_00001" with you. }}Brother, please recruit more people."</p>

    <p>"Aren't you looking for my Little Master Lingzi?"</p>

    <p>"Brother, aren't you still doing your homework? Let's settle this matter first. Don't dare to disturb your homework."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was sitting in the office. He felt a little uneasy. He looked at the peaceful and peaceful night outside the office window. It seemed that for a moment he could see dark clouds rolling in. He rubbed the back of his eyes. The dark clouds that disturbed the tranquility appeared again. It disappeared completely before our eyes like an illusion.</p>

    <p>Ten minutes ago, he received an intercom call from Warden Liang. Lao Liang didn't leave much content for him. He just talked about the newly detained prisoner Keorn.</p>

    <p>A good friend at work. Lao Liang is one of the few friends he can be close to. Although their jobs are very different, they usually talk to each other about any troubles they encounter.</p>

    <p>His tone was as calm as usual. He didn't show the slightest hint of panic: "Hey! Brother Zhuo! That news about Keorn Duncan. Have you seen it?"</p>

    <p>"Not only did I see it, I also got some information." Zhuo Yi's tone was as usual. He knew that Warden Liang most likely came to him to discuss some gossip about the prisoners. However, because the prisoners captured this time, Keorn and His master also has a certain relationship. So Zhuo Yi also learned some information through the internal channels of the War Ignorance Bureau.</p>

    <p>"I heard that this person is from the SBP Foundation. He has been in Huaxiu country 20 years ago. He travels all over the country to conduct secret investigation activities. He also pretends to be the ancestor of the killer world, Ghost Ax Spirit Mother, to earn funds for activities. He is also a A weird person." Zhuo Yi tried to recall the information he saw. The Office of Strategic Deception currently provides so much information. The information is updated almost in real time.</p>

    <p>When discussing Keorn with Warden Liang, Zhuo Yi also looked through the information in the Office of Strategic Deception's backend secret intelligence database. It was discovered that there was no latest update.</p>

    <p>He immediately knew the purpose of Lao Liang's call.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it's because the interrogation didn't go well. I wanted to find him to vent.</p>

    <p>"You know a lot, Brother Zhuo! But this matter is a bit unusual. This Keorn is different from all the prisoners I have received before..."</p>

    <p>"The mahjong trio from Songhai Prison are a weird combination. Is there anyone more weird than the three of them?"</p>

    <p>"Xi Ba! Brother Zhuo! I'm not kidding!" Warden Liang almost shouted. This sudden seriousness startled Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But soon he received an apology from Warden Liang: "I apologize to you, Brother Zhuo. I was a little too excited..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay, Brother Liang Yu. I understand. If you have any difficulties, you can tell me. Maybe I can help." Compared with the previous discussions about strange prisoners, Zhuo Yi finally felt that this time was special. feel.</p>

    <p>Lao Liang has always been a calm and bold person. The roar just now was not so much excitement as it was to embolden himself. Now Zhuo Yi also began to become curious. What is a foreign cultivator... How could Lao Liang be so upset?</p>

    <p>"You and I don't work in the same unit. But regarding this prisoner's case, based on my experience, it's better for Brother Zhuo not to get involved..." When Warden Liang spoke, perhaps he didn't even notice it. His voice was Somewhat trembling.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't want to make the atmosphere more solemn. He could only continue to talk to him in a joking tone: "I have a lot of work here. Is Brother Liang afraid that I will step in and take the credit? Don't worry, Brother Liang. This I Zhuo Yi promise you that I will not do anything about it."</p>

    <p>Over at the communication ball, Warden Liang's voice was obviously silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>At this point, the call is interrupted.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Zhuo Yi also fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>This phone call from Lao Liang is very strange.</p>

    <p>Normally, he would hardly add some modal particles deliberately in sentences, such as "xiba" and other vulgar words.</p>

    <p>Although the two of them don't work in the same company, they chat a lot. There is always a special tacit understanding between them.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi began to play back the recording of the passing ball. Carefully read every word Lao Liang said to himself. He felt that there might be hints from Lao Liang to him.</p>

    <p>He took out his notebook. Zhuo Yi recorded every word Lao Liang just said to him.</p>

    <p>"Hey! Brother Zhuo..."</p>

    <p>"You know a lot. Brother Zhuo..."</p>

    <p>"Xi Ba! Brother Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>"I apologize to you, brother Zhuo"</p>

    <p>"You and I don't work in the same company..."</p>

    <p>When these sentences are arranged together. Zhuo Yi I really found clues from the beginning of the sentence. These words are arranged together to form homophonic words. The formed words are: I have something for you...</p>

    <p>Did Lao Liang leave something for him?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels a little confused. At the same time, it feels a little funny. Because this code is so lame.</p>

    <p>But there is something to say. Even though it's lame, it just works.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't talked a lot with Lao Liang and knew Lao Liang's habit of using words and making sentences, he wouldn't have been able to understand the meaning of these words.</p>

    <p>According to the content of the call, Lao Liang probably had something to keep for himself.</p>

    <p>I waited restlessly in the office for a while. A stream of light flashed past Zhuo Yi outside the window!</p>

    <p>He recognized it at a glance. This was Lao Liang's exclusive flying sword! Infinite Sword!</p>

    <p>If someone is stabbed by the Infinity Sword, heavy chains will immediately grow out of the wound like grass, locking the enemy tightly!</p>

    <p>But this flying sword seems to have something very strange attached to it. It seems to be a burden...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi reacted quickly. He turned sideways and grabbed the flying sword firmly.</p>

    <p>The moment he took the sword, the baggage on the sword hilt rolled down. Blood instantly poured out of the bag, soaking the entire ground...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the scene in front of him in disbelief. He restrained his trembling body with force and used the infinite sword in his hand to open the baggage.</p>

    <p>And what was inside was Lao Liang's head.</p>

    <p>At the same time, several people in blue uniforms broke into Zhuo Yi's office at the same time.</p>

    <p>The man leading the charge was the captain of the Huaxiu Alliance branch in Songhai City. He stared at Zhuo Yi. He looked at Warden Liang's head on the ground. He sneered: "Director Zhuo, you killed Warden Liang. The evidence is conclusive." Now we officially capture you in the name of the branch!"</p>
