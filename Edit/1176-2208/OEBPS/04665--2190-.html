  <h1>Chapter 2190 The Surfing of the Immortal King [Love Chapter + Earth Center Chapter First Chapter]</h1>

  <div>

    <p>.The daily life of the immortal king</p>

    <p>Although You Yueqing's appearance made Sun Rong feel a sense of crisis. But judging from the results, Wang Ling seemed... to choose herself?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Sun Rong's heart almost cleared up. There was a feeling of clouds and fog dispersing, and sunlight falling on the earth. Countless beautiful flowers emerged from the ground and then "pengpengpengpeng" bloom.</p>

    <p>She wanted to ask Wang Ling why he made such a decision. But when she saw the young man rubbing the back of his head with a dull look on his face and a puzzled look on his face, she immediately stopped asking.</p>

    <p>Although this was a great opportunity, she didn't want to inquire too deeply and scare him easily.</p>

    <p>The biggest fear of wishful thinking and unrequited love is that the person you like has no feelings for you. Compared with the long-term devotion, you will not get any return. Wang Ling Such a small choice has given her great comfort.</p>

    <p>At least it proved that he might, maybe, should... probably also have a crush on her, right?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately burst into laughter.</p>

    <p>And I feel that this happiness can last for a long time. It can make her happy for at least a few days! No! Several months!</p>

    <p>Hmm... maybe I'll be happy for several years!</p>

    <p>After looking at the electronic map, they got off the tram midway and now they stopped at a rather awkward stop. The South Immortal District is to the south of Songhai. It is separated from the west by a grand canal.</p>

    <p>And now, she and Wang Ling were on the small island in the middle of the Grand Canal. After getting off the Lingtie station on the bridge across the river, they looked at the rushing river in front of them. The two of them fell into deep thought for a while.</p>

    <p>This is a no-fly zone. It is impossible to use the spirit sword to pass directly with the sword.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the south bank in the distance. Then he looked at the cross-river cable car on the right. This is one of the local tourism projects in Songhai. Monks who come to travel can take the cable car along the urgently needed Grand Canal. Enjoy the beautiful city view of Songhai.</p>

    <p>Normally, there are more people riding the cable car at night. I wonder if it's the peak tourist season. There were actually quite a few people riding the cable car during the day.</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, Wang Ling gave up the idea of teleporting over with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There are many people here and there are many eyes. Use space magic. It is inevitable that it will be recorded by the monks who are taking pictures of the scenery with their mobile phones.</p>

    <p>[A book-chasing app recommended to me by an old book friend I've known for ten years. Yeguo Reading! It's really easy to use. I rely on this app to read and listen to books while driving and before going to bed. You can download it here]</p>

    <p>Even though the possibility of just photographing them disappearing may not be high. But even if there is only one chance in ten thousand, Wang Ling should be taken into consideration.</p>

    <p>So, after thinking carefully, Wang Ling took Sun Rong to the riverside of the Central Island site. First, he took out a helmet and put it on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Then. He put on his helmet again.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling... Do you want to..."</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, Wang Ling took out Jingke. He transformed Jingke into a surf pedal and floated steadily on the river.</p>

    <p>Although you can't directly wield the sword and fly in the air. There is a flying ban.</p>

    <p>But according to Wang Ling's investigation, there is no surfing ban here!</p>

    <p>"You can also surf?"Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that Wang Ling was not only omnipotent in cultivation, but also versatile. He played guitar last semester... and now he can also surf...</p>

    <p>"It's not difficult. Just watch the short video and learn."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>In the context of the modern scientific cultivation era, the way monks receive information has become different. A large amount of knowledge can be obtained by watching short videos. Wang Ling is naturally no exception.</p>

    <p>He is also an ordinary ordinary person. Except for Heavenly Dao, which is something he is born with, many other skills need to be learned by Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>But what was different from other monks was that Wang Ling found that he learned very quickly.</p>

    <p>Many things can be understood by just watching short videos.</p>

    <p>Normal people have a good brain but their hands/feet can't keep up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Yes. I have the brain and can keep up with my hands/feet.</p>

    <p>The ability like surfing was learned by Wang Ling by watching short videos.</p>

    <p>However, based on the current direction of the river on the river, it is obvious that you cannot glide in the direction of the current to cross it.</p>

    <p>He took Sun Rong with his hand and asked her to stand behind him. Sun Rong's hands naturally hugged Wang Ling's waist.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling's sword heart was clear. He just gave Jingke telepathic instructions. Jingke consciously released a powerful turbo cyclone at the end of the spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The two people turned into a laser and rushed straight along the Grand Canal. The monks on the cable car didn't even see what was happening. The Songhai Grand Canal in front of them was briefly divided into two halves...</p>

    <p>Is this... the immortal king's surfing?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong discovered that the scene of surfing together with Wang Ling's waist was not at all what he imagined.</p>

    <p>She thought it was the kind of softer and more romantic surfing. The two of them stood on the spiritual sword together. The river wind blew against her and his ears, passing over their clothes. Fish jumped from the river surface, allowing them to have fun. Then you can spend some free time enjoying the scenery along the way.</p>

    <p>Result...</p>

    <p>Everything is done in an instant.</p>

    <p>Like a monkey flying across the river...</p>

    <p>Before Sun Rong could react, he had already reached the other side.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Along the south bank of the river, there was a tight construction site surrounded by a three-meter blue barrier. The people who were planning inside were startled by the loud noise caused by Wang Ling from outside.</p>

    <p>They are aliens who smuggled themselves to the earth from extraterrestrial planets. They have been lurking on the earth for some time. They are accepting the employer's commission to set up a secret magic circle buried underground along the south bank of the river.</p>

    <p>This array has a total of 12 components. They are only responsible for part of it. When all 12 components are completed, it will directly become a super array. At that time, it can directly cover the entire Songhai City.</p>

    <p>This plan is secret.</p>

    <p>They took over the land as a construction company. On the surface, they were laying the foundation for the construction of a new building. In fact, they were doing this kind of shameful thing behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the construction was almost completed, a loud noise on the Songhai Canal attracted their attention.</p>

    <p>"Discovered?"</p>

    <p>The alien creature in charge broke into a cold sweat for a moment.</p>

    <p>It is a humanoid tentacle monster. It has human limbs but an octopus head. Its mouthparts can spray poisonous ink.</p>

    <p>"Boss. What should we do now?" asked a subordinate who also had an octopus head.</p>

    <p>"Find someone to test it out! Remember! Let it wear a painted skin!" said the octopus-headed boss.</p>

    <p>This is how alien creatures like them survive in the human world. They usually wear custom-made paintings from the human world for work. This makes them look no different from normal human monks.</p>

    <p>Of course, these high-grade paintings are also provided by their employers. They are very breathable and durable.</p>

    <p>Now we have reached the critical stage of arranging the array. There are only a few final steps left to complete the acceptance. Then they can get the money to repair the spacecraft and leave the earth...</p>

    <p>There must be absolutely no mistakes!</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, the octopus-headed boss also took out a painted leather mask and put it on, preparing to go out to check the situation in person.</p>
