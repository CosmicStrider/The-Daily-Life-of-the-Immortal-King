  <h1>Chapter 1727 Strengthening after Moonlight Baptism</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Obviously. As a person who has experienced it, Shou Chong has some special hobbies in the process of love. But it does not mean that other people will also have special hobbies in love.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling feels that he can't fall in love at all, let alone have any fetishes.</p>

    <p>He simply couldn't imagine himself falling in love.</p>

    <p>If you write a romance novel based on him, even if you just kiss a girl, the description will have to change from "Ah! So the feeling of kissing is sweet strawberry or blueberry!" to "Ah! So the feeling of kissing is salty. The salty peppery flavor..."</p>

    <p>This scene is a bit too exciting for Wang Ling. Coupled with a slight social phobia. The more Wang Ling thinks about it, the more he becomes afraid...</p>

    <p>At this moment, a drop of cold sweat slid down Wang Ling's forehead. He said nothing. He just stared at Shou Chong through the space wall in Sun Rong's sword spirit space.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Shou Chong seemed to be aware of it. For some reason, he suddenly felt a chill running down his spine... as if he had the illusion that he was being targeted by some dangerous creature.</p>

    <p>He shrank his neck and immediately realized that maybe he had said something wrong.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Rong is just a little girl who is only in her first year of high school. The little girl's family may not be able to understand the sticky and fiery feeling when love develops to the final home run stage. Now to say this, it is indeed a bit of a saying. It's still too early.</p>

    <p>He was very sensible. He just smiled awkwardly and continued to help Wang Ming work together.</p>

    <p>"You are too anxious. For things like assists, you have to pay attention to step by step. When you get out, there will be plenty of opportunities." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"eh... I'm a little impatient."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong nodded: "Then, can I ask the last question again, Mr. Ming?"</p>

    <p>"What's the problem?" Wang Ming was curious.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong scratched his messy hair: "What is the relationship between the girl Sun Rong and the girl named Jiugong Liangzi?"</p>

    <p>"What kind of relationship can there be between women? Of course they are not love rivals. They are best friends." Wang Ming couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"So that's what it is..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong suddenly understood. He quickly thanked: "I understand. Thank you, Mr. Ming."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, everything was as he suspected!</p>

    <p>The relationship between these three people is indeed Shura Field<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("修羅場" Buddhism term referring to the battlefield.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at Shou Chong's expression, which looked a bit unbeatable. He didn't know why, but he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p>

    <p>But now, most of his attention is still on making the giant mecha in his hand. He has not been distracted by too many other things. Shou Chong's expression is certainly unbeatable, but he really doesn't think too much.</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>Does anyone really think that Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong are love rivals?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, when Jingze and Yan? were defeated from the Wang family's villa, due to Jingze's injury, the two quickly returned to the Baobai Group's floating boat.</p>

    <p>SCB-L001 is injured.</p>

    <p>As the first dragonborn to be successfully cultivated, Jingze's injuries have attracted much attention. Since his birth, he has almost never experienced the feeling of being injured.</p>

    <p>And this time, it was also Jingze's first experience of being injured. Generally speaking, it made him feel a different kind of wonderful feeling.</p>

    <p>"So, this is what pain feels like..."</p>

    <p>In the core world shrouded in golden lightning, he shook his dragon claws and bathed in the thunder.</p>

    <p>Dragonborn can accelerate the recovery of his injuries by extracting the power of natural elements that match his attributes.</p>

    <p>But what Jingze didn't expect was that Wang Nuan's two punches actually had serious injury effects, making his recovery speed extremely slow.</p>

    <p>So annoying...</p>

    <p>"Why did you run away just now? If you join forces with me, we may have been able to defeat her." Yan? Holding a cone, she stayed with Jingze.</p>

    <p>"That child is very dangerous. This time is a critical moment for the dragon clan's revival... I can't make a single mistake and do something that I am not sure about." Jingze sighed and explained.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to run away in despair like a mouse. As a dragonborn who inherited the power of a dragon, for the dragon clan, such an act of running away was a shame.</p>

    <p>Dragon warriors should die fighting! Not surrendering because of fighting!</p>

    <p>After sorting out his thoughts, Jingze rubbed his brows and said, "Don't forget, we have a labor contract. We just follow the employee system here. If we are not sure, we can choose to leave according to the task rules."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Yan? pursed her red lips and said, "But that little guy is really interesting. Even if you have to leave, you still want me to try it out just now."</p>

    <p>"If there is still a chance, I will definitely let you try."</p>

    <p>Jingze endured the pain and showed a smile.</p>

    <p>In response to this, Yan? criticized mercilessly: "You look so ugly when you smile."</p>

    <p>"Really..."</p>

    <p>Jingze looked embarrassed.</p>

    <p>He found that after meeting Yan?, his personality seemed to have changed unknowingly. He had never smiled at someone with such an expression before.</p>

    <p>But now, disgust has appeared.</p>

    <p>No matter how much he didn't want to admit it, the fact was that the evacuation had just been confirmed. A large part of the reason was because he didn't want anything to happen to his men.</p>

    <p>This injury made him realize many things.</p>

    <p>He gradually began to feel some unknown emotions arising within him.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this defeat also inspired a fighting spirit.</p>

    <p>The family named Wang...</p>

    <p>This family must not be allowed to survive.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the Dragon Clan revives in the future, this family will be the Dragon Clan's enemy in the future!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>At this time, under the continuous roar of thousands of thunders in Jingze's exclusive dragon-born core world, there was a bright moonlight that seemed to penetrate the eternal universe. It broke through the sky and fell with a kind of holy brilliance.</p>

    <p>The bright stars were dotted with an immortal dragon power. Jingze and Yan raised their heads almost at the same moment, with a bit of surprise in their eyes.</p>

    <p>"Lord Moon Dragon..."</p>

    <p>Jingze and Yan? both sensed the breath of moonlight!</p>

    <p>That is the smell of Moonlight Dragon, one of the three leaders of the dragon clan!</p>

    <p>This bright moonlight quickly focused after it fell. Then it slowly converged on Jingze. Almost instantly, his injured body became healed. The power of the moonlight poured in inch by inch, penetrating into every cell of his body. Inside... Jingze actually felt that the spiritual energy in his body was full as never before!</p>

    <p>"Your aura seems to have become stronger!" Yan? looked shocked.</p>

    <p>"That's right. This is the Moon Dragon Lord's Eternal Moon Starlight. It can quickly recover injuries. And within a limited time, it can gain power beyond its own combat power."</p>

    <p>Jingze shook hands. He felt strengthened.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I couldn't help but feel even more excited.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe's "Eternal Moon Star Glory" directly brought him five times the power of the dragon compared to before!</p>

    <p>If it is such a power...</p>

    <p>He is confident that he will completely defeat the baby girl from before!</p>

    <p>Even. Captured alive in public!</p>
