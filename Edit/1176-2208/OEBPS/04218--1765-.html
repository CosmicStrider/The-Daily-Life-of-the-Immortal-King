  <h1>Chapter 1765 If you can beat me, then fight. If you can't beat me...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At noon that day, Father Wang and Mother Wang saw that Wang Ling, for the first time, did not choose to stay at home and study while eating crispy noodles. Instead, he changed into a neat set of sportswear and got ready to go out.</p>

    <p>If they usually go out to do something, the couple would never feel strange. But today, They don't know why. Father Wang and Mother Wang felt the same way.</p>

    <p>That is. Wang Ling... something is wrong...</p>

    <p>"Tell me, will Ling Ling have a girlfriend?" On the sofa, She saw Wang Ling putting on shoes at the entrance. Mother Wang couldn't help but push Father Wang with her elbow while holding Wang Nuan in her arms.</p>

    <p>Father Wang quietly put down the newspaper with two holes dug in it. He was also confused: "No way... our son. Finally the iron tree has bloomed?"</p>

    <p>He feels that at Wang Ling's age, it is normal to like someone or be liked by others. Young people are just starting to fall in love. When they are not so mature, relationships are just a matter of time. Not to mention the Huaguo Shuilian Group's That Miss Sun was so bombarded by sugar-coated bullets. Father Wang felt that if it were him, he probably wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p>

    <p>The couple stared at Wang Ling's back as he changed shoes for a long time. With a thought in their minds, their hearts for gossip couldn't help but burn brightly.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Ling chose to close the door that Mother Wang decided to get up. She held Ah Nuan and carefully handed her into Father Wang's generous and warm arms: "This way, you can watch Ah Nuan at home. I will take a look."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was speechless for a while. Sometimes women's gossips are aroused, which is such a terrible thing.</p>

    <p>It should be said that those unscrupulous gossip reporters in the entertainment industry have been scolded every day and still collect celebrity gossip regardless of rain or shine. In the final analysis, it is because of market demand.</p>

    <p>Since there is market demand, it means there is money to be made.</p>

    <p>Father Wang thinks this is a bad trend and should be resisted.</p>

    <p>In the end, Mother Wang just rolled her eyes at him. He immediately withered, she said: "What do you know? Aren't we also caring about Ling Ling? So that he doesn't go astray. Young people's love is all temporary. Speaking of which...what if the person he likes is not the Sun Rong girl."</p>

    <p>"..." Father Wang was silent.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the second half of the sentence is the key!</p>

    <p>God? What should I do if the person I like is not the girl Sun Rong... It turns out that you have already chosen her, right?</p>

    <p>Women... are so easy to buy. Don't they just send you some high-end beauty products every month? Is it necessary...</p>

    <p>That little girl and Wang Ling are about the same age. How do they know what real love is?</p>

    <p>Father Wang thought so in his heart. And Mother Wang seemed to always be able to see through Father Wang's little thoughts. She smiled: "Do you know the person who ranks first in the rewards of your readers?"</p>

    <p>"That one you're talking about, Furong Nuxia?" Father Wang immediately reported the reader's ID.</p>

    <p>This is the champion reader who has been on the tipping list for three consecutive months. The amount of tips in just one day exceeded the total amount of tips given to him by Zhuo Yi with the ID of "Super University Level Vice President" that year.</p>

    <p>Father Wang has actually always wanted to find an opportunity to get to know this wealthy reader. However, Furong Nuxia is too mysterious. Apart from giving rewards and looking for various opportunities to dominate the rankings, they have not joined any reader groups or commented in the comment area.</p>

    <p>"Do you know this Furong Nuxia?" Father Wang raised his eyebrows and said while looking at Mother Wang who was changing clothes.</p>

    <p>"They say that one pregnancy lasts three years. Why do I feel that it's not me who is stupid, but you who are stupid... Isn't this Rongrong." Mother Wang said with a smile.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang heard this, he instantly changed his previous expression. He looked at Mother Wang with firm eyes: "Okay, dear, I support all your actions!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang chuckled.</p>

    <p>Men... are so easy to bribe.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, Ling Ling has already left. How are you going to catch up?"</p>

    <p>"Just ask Lord Ma to send me there. By the way, let Lord Ma cover for me. I believe there won't be any problem."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually felt that he was being watched not long after he went out.</p>

    <p>And the person who is spying on me is still my mother...</p>

    <p>Of course, he also understands that Lord Ma is also uncomfortable being caught in the middle. On one side is the Immortal King, and on the other side is the Immortal King's mother...it is hard to offend both sides. Lord Ma naturally has to obey Mother Wang's instructions.</p>

    <p>He was helpless. There was no other way now. Since Mother Wang was following him, he had no choice but to get Muyu to change his appearance. This would save him from having to explain to Mother Wang clearly when she saw Muyu had exactly the same face as him.</p>

    <p>Ribak Cafe in Yida Plaza in the city center. Wang Ling and Wang Muyu will meet here today.</p>

    <p>The little guy was quite obedient. After seeing his text message, he took the initiative to change his appearance. He became plump.</p>

    <p>It's just that it's different from the last time he went to Duobao City. He didn't lengthen his height. He didn't have the greasy look of a fat man. Instead, he turned into a cute little fat man.</p>

    <p>The facial features are still somewhat similar to his, but because he has gained weight, you can't really tell if you don't look closely.</p>

    <p>"Dad...brother!" When they met, the little guy almost spilled the beans in excitement. The shout made Wang Ling nervous for a while. Fortunately, he stopped it in the end.</p>

    <p>You are not allowed to call Wang Ling "daddy" in front of outsiders. This was agreed before. Wang Muyu did not disobey intentionally. He was just too happy after seeing Wang Ling for a while.</p>

    <p>Because this is the first time Wang Ling has asked him to go out. Let Wang Ling experience the cultivation life in modern society. Not counting the time he sneaked out to Duobao City before, his whole world seems to be It's the Huaguo Shuilian Group's large, unchanged science and technology park. It has everything in it, but I don't know why it feels like it's missing a bit of fireworks when walking around.</p>

    <p>The employees in the park all greeted him with smiles when they saw him. They were all polite. No matter how naughty and mischievous he was, he always had that professional smile. Wang Muyu often felt as if he was being locked up. In a set world.</p>

    <p>And now when he goes out with Wang Ling, this feeling is instantly dispelled.</p>

    <p>And now he and Wang Ling have a common hobby. That is, he is also one of the fanatics...</p>

    <p>At first, Wang Muyu had to admit that he actually didn't like eating snacks from the human world.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for hearing that Wang Ling likes to eat crispy noodles, he probably wouldn't have touched that kind of food that is full of the smell of pepper noodles.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because he wanted to understand Wang Ling that he made up his mind to give it a try.</p>

    <p>As a result of this attempt, he found that it was still very good...</p>

    <p>And he discovered that the snacks in the human world seemed to make him happy.</p>

    <p>Not just crispy noodles. He can also accept potato chips, spicy sticks, etc.</p>

    <p>This is a vice.</p>

    <p>The Dragon Rebirth and all that.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu actually thought clearly from the beginning.</p>

    <p>It would probably be difficult for him to do it alone.</p>

    <p>It's better to hug the legs in front of you tightly...</p>

    <p>He is actually very open-minded.</p>

    <p>More enlightened than all the dragon clan members.</p>

    <p>Fight if you can.</p>

    <p>Can't beat it. Then join...</p>
