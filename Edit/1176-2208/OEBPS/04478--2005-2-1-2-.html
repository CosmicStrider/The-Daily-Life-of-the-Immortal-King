  <h1>Chapter 2005 2 in 1. The troops are divided into 2 groups</h1>

  <div>

    <p>According to the current form of plan layout. Wang Ling accounting divides it into two steps.</p>

    <p>The first is to ask Zhuo Yi to ask for leave from Number 60 High School. Everyone from Number 60 High School who participated in this plan in the name of a special training camp before the Earth Center Project was summoned.</p>

    <p>Of course. The main purpose is to help Sun Rong, Chen Chao, and Guo Hao complete the breakthrough to the peak state of Foundation Building in the later stage before the plan.</p>

    <p>The rest of them are just sparring partners. After all, Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, and Liu Qingyi are also part of this plan. It would be strange if they weren't called out.</p>

    <p>As for Jiugong Liangzi, she has already broken through the late stage of Foundation Building and reached the Golden Core level. For Jiugong Liangzi, this training camp is actually equivalent to a secret date with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The second step. Wang Ling is to ask Lord Diulei to investigate the records of all the meteorites that crashed into the earth before and after Bai Zhe transformed into the Moonlight Dragon, and to investigate them as much as possible to ensure that there are no weird things falling on the earth.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this is a huge investigation project. Because there are tens of thousands of various meteorites falling on the earth every year. The key is that the coordinates and locations of these meteorites fall all over the world. We really need to track and lock them all. Will need help from the Academy of Cultivation Sciences to provide detailed data records.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although this work was led by Lord Diulei, in fact the cooperation between Wang Ming and Shou Chong was also essential.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, don't worry. Your concern is completely correct. I will do my best to investigate this matter! And brother Xiao Yin can also help with this matter." Lord Diulei quickly sent Wang Ling information.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling almost forgot that Xiao Yin is a divine beast that evolved from a holy beast. The holy beast blood in its body has a stronger danger perception ability than ordinary spiritual beasts. It is a ready-made flesh detector.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded. Then he replied with only one word, as always, sparing every word.</p>

    <p>It is almost impossible to investigate all the meteorites that fell within one to two years in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>But this matter can only be realized if it is handed over to Lord Diulei, who is now the head of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>After all, as the first True Venerated Immortal on earth. In addition, the Office of Strategic Deception's growing international influence. Even if the meteorite falls into the borders of other cultivating countries, Lord Diulei must still have a way to track it.</p>

    <p>For the Death Seeking Senior, who is already very adventurous, this meteorite investigation is not so much a test as it is an extremely enjoyable practice activity for him.</p>

    <p>Of course, this matter is also very expensive. But with the current background of the Office of Strategic Deception, it is completely affordable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gives the word. Lord Diulei will do it without hesitation.</p>

    <p>And some money has to be burned. Compared with worldly money, the safety of cultivators on the entire earth is the most critical.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling also started thinking after hearing about the meteorite mentioned by Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>Are these meteorites carrying private goods arranged by Bai Zhe?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that since Bai Zhe can think of this, can other extraterrestrial civilizations who have ideas about the earth also think of this?</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling not able to help but be a little cautious.</p>

    <p>As for the universe, the aloofness and arrogance of advanced civilizations have always existed. In the eyes of those advanced civilizations, the level of civilization on the earth may be just an anthill built by a group of bugs.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has sealed Cosmic Embryo in the King's Eyes. He also used "Eye Pupil Number 03: Re-engraved True Spiritual Eye" to simulate Cosmic Embryo's signal and sneak it into the palace of the Saints quietly.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling always has a feeling.</p>

    <p>That is, the earth's cultivation civilization was very likely to have been observed a long time ago...</p>

    <p>But what is the specific situation? He only needs to wait for Lord Diulei to clarify all the results of this year's investigation. Maybe he can draw a conclusion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He found that he seemed to be in trouble ever since he entered Number 60 High School. This has not stopped for a few days...</p>

    <p>Obviously he came to school, but as a result, he immediately started to safeguard the peace of the earth.</p>

    <p>This generation of cultivators is really not good enough.</p>

    <p>There are few who are capable. There are even fewer who are strong...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he should really train more talents. Otherwise, when he gets old, his retirement life will not be stable.</p>

    <p>They can let him maintain the peace of the universe for the rest of his life, right?</p>

    <p>He still has to leave time to eat crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, January 20th. There are still 11 days until the Earth Center Project begins.</p>

    <p>In 11 days, he has to help Sun Rong, Chen Chao, and Guo Hao break through the late peak of Foundation Building one after another. According to the basic training outline, this is completely impossible.</p>

    <p>Even with the help of the best heavenly materials and earthly treasures, it is not that easy.</p>

    <p>Of course. If Wang Ling directly goes to do psychic infusion to increase the strength, the people can achieve an instant breakthrough.</p>

    <p>But this will affect the foundation of the future to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>And in fact, Wang Ling is not sure. If he infuses it, maybe Sun Rong, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and others will directly become the True Immortal state...</p>

    <p>The True Immortal Realm of a high school student. The news of this incident is enough to subvert the entire world of cultivation. This period of history will be recorded directly in the annals of history.</p>

    <p>So after careful consideration, Wang Ling decided that it would be most appropriate to let them break through through their own efforts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Zhuo Yi would ask for leave. So he didn't go to class that morning. Instead, he went directly to the Office of Strategic Deception. The secret entrance to the Secret Realm of Cultivation and the Mountain of Retrospection.</p>

    <p>Here. Sun Rong once conducted a sword test. Even Er Ha and Xiao Yin were promoted to divine beasts here.</p>

    <p>Because there is a time flow rate difference, 11 days in the real world is completely enough.</p>

    <p>Even after Chen Chao and the others broke through the Golden Core, they realized that not long had passed at all.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling came here first. In fact, it was also a further transformation of the Mountain of Retrospection.</p>

    <p>After all, the Mountain of Retrospection also contains the energy of chaos. If it is used directly by low-level cultivators for Tribulation Transcendence breakthrough, there will inevitably be some risks.</p>

    <p>So this time. Wang Ling added the setting of intelligent realm matching to the Mountain of Retrospection.</p>

    <p>That is to say, set up the compiled formation at the entrance. Then the Mountain of Retrospection will scan everyone who enters the formation. After identifying the realm, it will match the most suitable training environment.</p>

    <p>In addition. Wang Ling also adds a multi-layer space mechanism.</p>

    <p>Or through the arranged identification array. Everyone who enters the Mountain of Retrospection will be automatically assigned to a completely independent space to avoid mutual interference.</p>

    <p>That should be enough...</p>

    <p>After setting up everything. Wang Ling looked at the holy land of cultivation in front of him.</p>

    <p>According to the current stage, this mountain of retrospect is definitely a mysterious realm that is enough to shock cultivators around the world.</p>

    <p>If there is such a secret entrance inside the Office of Strategic Deception and it is exposed, it will detonate the whole world in an instant.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling specially added a forgetting mechanism at the entrance this time.</p>

    <p>Except for those on the designated whitelist, all those who leave the Mountain of Retrospection after completing their cultivation will forget the existence of the Mountain of Retrospection...</p>

    <p>This article is specially prepared for Chen Chao, Guo Hao and the master they are about to bring.</p>

    <p>Cang Long and Liu Yong are not very familiar with Wang Ling. If the secret realm is exposed, it will cause big trouble.</p>

    <p>So he has to guard against it.</p>

    <p>But when writing the whitelist.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying discovered that Wang Ling had written the names of most of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And this also includes Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School Academic Affairs Office.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is requesting leave from training for everyone involved in the Earth Center Project.</p>

    <p>In terms of process, this requires the designated student's class teacher to fill out a form. First, apply to the school department.</p>

    <p>It is then forwarded to the Academic Affairs Guidance Office through the academic department. Finally, it must be signed by both deans before it is approved.</p>

    <p>And each of these two people is Teacher Wang, who is nicknamed Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>The other person is the newly arrived dean of the Coordination Department, You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi also received a special approval letter from the vice-principal Monk Jin Deng. Therefore, the process was directly simplified. All you need to do is get the signature of either of the two deans.</p>

    <p>"This time, General Administration Zhuo will personally lead the team. Of course we are absolutely at ease. Moreover, this is bringing glory to the school and even more to the country. I have no reason to refuse this training. Those children in the elite class are already very good."</p>

    <p>"Director Wang deserves the award. This is all what I can do." Zhuo Yi responded politely.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is the head of a hundred schools. He can make the decision even without going through the process of Number 60 High School. But after all, this is his alma mater. Zhuo Yi still gives enough respect to all the teachers here.</p>

    <p>You can't just show off your power when you have some skills. This is not Zhuo Yi's temperament.</p>

    <p>In any situation, one must be humble enough.</p>

    <p>"In addition, this is my plan. Please take a look at it." He said. Zhuo Yi took out a piece of thick material from the storage ring and put his hands on the desk.</p>

    <p>"You are interested. General Administration Zhuo."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong saw that Zhuo Yi had even prepared the training plan. Such detailed preparations. Only this old senior who also came from the 60th School could do such thorough preparations.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi was originally an alumnus of Number 60 High School. In addition, Zhuo Yi is now the General Administration of Hundred Schools in Songhai City. Lao Gudong is of course assured.</p>

    <p>Besides, the place chosen for training this time is still within the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>This is the most popular super sect among cultivators in the world right now. How many people want to enter the Office of Strategic Deception and become an inner disciple. But as a result, the youth training process is too much and they are immediately dismissed.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in the view of Lao Gudong, this intensive training is also an opportunity to expand his horizons.</p>

    <p>If Zhuo Yi hadn't been connected to the Office of Strategic Deception, most people wouldn't have had the opportunity to observe the Office of Strategic Deception at such a close distance, or even have the opportunity to practice internally.</p>

    <p>"I definitely have no objection here. I wonder if Director You has any other suggestions?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Gudong suddenly turned his attention to You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi saw You Yueqing seemingly in a daze.</p>

    <p>In fact, he discovered it when he just entered the office and asked for his signature.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was staring at the list and lost in thought.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi and You Yueqing actually know each other. And Zhuo Yi also clearly knows that You Yueqing and Wang Ling actually knew each other when they were very young.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, he was worried about whether You Yueqing was really here for his master... But now after getting in touch with her, he found that the relationship between You Yueqing and Wang Ling was just pure friendship. Not mixed with any sublimated emotions.</p>

    <p>In other words, You Yueqing's purpose of entering Number 60 High School as the teaching director of the Coordination Department was not for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But someone else on this list...</p>

    <p>But who is it?</p>

    <p>As far as the timeline is concerned, it's impossible for Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi. After all, they don't have much interaction with You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Among the remaining people, there are only three who have doubts.</p>

    <p>One Chen Chao, one Guo Hao... and the rest is Fang Xing...</p>

    <p>"No. It's okay... I'm fine! And I think General Administration Zhuo's plan is also very good! Although it only requires a signature, I think I still have to sign it. I have to support the children's training!" When asked by Lao Gudong, You Yueqing said as if she was possessed by her soul.</p>

    <p>"Then thank you for your guidance..." Zhuo Yi bowed. In fact, he was smiling bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Obviously You Yueqing is a child herself...</p>

    <p>However, You Yueqing's strength is indeed unfathomable. It stands to reason that at this age, it would be impossible for her to reach such a state if there was no inheritance.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Zhuo Yi will keep this in mind for now.</p>

    <p>His main suspects were Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>If You Yueqing had a relationship with one of these three people in the past, then according to common sense, some of these three people should have met You Yueqing when they were very young.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, there is no way to attract this young and beautiful female Taoist priest. She didn't care about anything. She even gave up her work in the Taoist temple and went straight to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Emotions are really blinding things...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was secretly happy.</p>

    <p>For Chen Chao and Guo Hao, this training camp is a difficult training. But for Zhuo Yi, it is a travel and honeymoon with Jiugong Liangzi!</p>

    <p>After getting the approval, Zhuo Yi personally drove a bus directly to the gate of Number 60 High School and waited for the head teachers of each class to notify the students to come out.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, in order not to leak any clues, he had already been waiting obediently in the bus wearing his school uniform.</p>

    <p>Externally, it was said that he was late for school because the line was down on the way to school. Then he happened to meet Zhuo Yi and got in the car directly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat at the very back of the bus with a straight face. Not long after, he heard Chen Chao's carefree shouting in the distance.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, get in the bus quickly!" From the driver's seat, Zhuo Yi's right hand was firmly on the stick shift. He looked at the people gathered here with a smile.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Jiugong Liangzi was actually a little embarrassed in such an occasion.</p>

    <p>After all, neither Chen Chao nor Guo Hao knew about her relationship with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>There were outsiders, so she had no choice but to carry herself. When she saw Zhuo Yi, she immediately snorted softly and walked towards the back of the bus.</p>

    <p>This attitude made Zhuo Yi slightly unhappy. Although he knew that Jiugong Liangzi was pretending, he still couldn't help teasing Jiugong.</p>

    <p>Seeing Jiugong Liangzi passing by him without looking back. Zhuo Yi immediately started laughing: "Jiugong's temper really hasn't changed at all. If you have a boyfriend in the future, your boyfriend must not be fooled by you. Will be scared to death."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiugong Liangzi's face turned red. She didn't expect that Zhuo Yi would actually attack at this time.</p>

    <p>How can it be repaired! This disgusting old liar!</p>

    <p>Let's see how she deals with him later when everyone is gone!</p>
