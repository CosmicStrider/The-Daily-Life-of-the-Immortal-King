  <h1>Chapter 2122 Knowledge changes destiny</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The latest website: The start of a piece of silver. It is still very chilling. In contrast, Wang Ling has completed two hidden tasks in succession at the beginning. Not to mention gaining two new identities. Even the General's Mansion and Fuyun Town The military power was controlled by one hand.</p>

    <p>Zanghu only knows that Wang Ming has arranged for two mysterious people to help him at a critical moment. But he does not know the true identities of these two people. At the moment, he can only rely on himself to start the game world.</p>

    <p>It is never easy to save up a small goal in a completely unfamiliar environment in a short period of time. Let alone a game world. Even in real life, it is very difficult.</p>

    <p>Except for the factor of luck, without connections and starting capital, everything else is empty talk. Mr. Zanghu has a particularly clear mind. Now all he can rely on is his huge knowledge reserve.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the game world of {Itinerant Immortal} is strictly based on the real world of cultivation. Here, Mr. Zanghu feels that he has a lot to do.</p>

    <p>One ingot of silver. It's enough for the travel expenses. But it's still a bit awkward to come back.</p>

    <p>According to Mr. Zanghu's plan, he will use the travel expenses to go to the resource area that was lit up. Then he will refine the elixir through his own ear knowledge in the resource area. Finally, he will sell it to these towns for distribution.</p>

    <p>But the starting capital at the beginning is far from enough. Although he can walk along the way back, but without a hired convoy to escort him, he will inevitably encounter danger on his own.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it again and again, Mr. Zanghu glanced at the pawnshop owner in front of him and took the initiative to ask: "Excuse me, are you still hiring people here?"</p>

    <p>Yes. There is a part-time job mechanism in {Itinerant Immortal Art Ring}. When there is insufficient money, players can exchange for part-time job opportunities by asking the shop NPC in the map. The construction period will not be long. And in a short time Can get high salary.</p>

    <p>But relatively speaking, the conditions for successfully triggering a part-time job task are also very demanding. In addition to players asking independently, the store will also issue corresponding initial tasks. Only after completing the tasks can you get the opportunity.</p>

    <p>The pawnshop owner glanced at Mr. Zanghu. Maybe he had never seen such a weird-looking guy. The owner pushed up his glasses and said immediately: "You have pawned your clothes and trousers. So you are not a spiritual beast from another family?"</p>

    <p>"I am a human being." Mr. Zanghu said with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>He's used to it.</p>

    <p>I don't mind at all when outsiders make fun of my appearance.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Mr. Zanghu also knows that the conditions of this game are harsher and more complicated than he imagined.</p>

    <p>He has a job seeker mentality now. Naturally, it is impossible for him to fall out in person.</p>

    <p>On the way to the Karma Base, Mr. Zanghu spent a short time looking at the introductory guide to the game. Even every dialogue and choice in this game requires caution.</p>

    <p>"You guys are interesting." The fat pawnshop owner laughed. Then he turned around and took a bracelet from his counter and handed it to Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the system also gave Mr. Zanghu two options.</p>

    <p>[① There are multiple-choice answers (choose one answer from four. If the answer is correct, the part-time job task will be successfully started. The task reward will depend on the specific tasks completed after the part-time job is started)]</p>

    <p>[②None-option answer (no-option answer. You need to answer based on your own knowledge reserve. If you answer correctly, you will not only successfully receive the part-time task, but also get double the part-time reward. And you will also get hidden rewards)]</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu only glanced at it and chose ② without hesitation. He believed that with his own knowledge reserve, he could successfully complete this task.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the bracelet handed over by the boss. He looked at it carefully for a while, and then quickly gave his appraisal result.</p>

    <p>"A glass bracelet from the modern era. Judging from the specifications and format, it is an old item passed down from a large sect in the modern era. The green dragon, white tiger, red bird, and Xuanwu on it reminded me of a brand that was very famous in modern times and then gradually declined. Sword sect."</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu said with a confident smile. Sure enough, everything was as he thought. Many objects in the game are derived from data in the real world.</p>

    <p>Like this bracelet. He had been lucky enough to see it once in the Cultivation Museum. Therefore, he had a very clear idea of the origin of this bracelet.</p>

    <p>He spoke eloquently, and it was almost exactly the same as the historical data recorded in reality: "As far as I know, the full name of this large sect is Wuji Sword Sect. This sword sect was founded by the sword immortal Fan Rui, and later evolved into the Four Symbols. Such a famous branch. But it is a pity that this sword sect is now in decline."</p>

    <p>He didn't say any more because he wasn't sure whether the person he mentioned later was a plus or a minus. Although he knew more, he also knew that too much talk could lead to more mistakes.</p>

    <p>You must also learn to stop talking. Otherwise, you will be suspected of showing off.</p>

    <p>"Exactly!" Obviously, the pawnshop owner was also horrified. He had no idea that the unattractive human-shaped Tibetan fox in front of him could actually tell the truth about the treasure in his pawnshop.</p>

    <p>Almost instantly, Mr. Zanghu received the system prompt of [You have successfully started the part-time job] simultaneously. And he also received a hidden reward for the no-option answer.</p>

    <p>Huanglong Town pawnshop clerk's scarf (blue), Huanglong Town pawnshop clerk's clothing set (blue).</p>

    <p>Two pieces of blue equipment surprised Mr. Zanghu. But soon a basin of cold water was poured on him.</p>

    <p>Because just when he was about to put the equipment on his body, the system error message appeared again.</p>

    <p>[System: Please do not wear equipment of different races on yourself]</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Isn't this bullying an honest person?</p>

    <p>The corner of Mr. Zanghu's mouth twitched. He looked at the two pieces of equipment that he couldn't wear. He was secretly worried in his heart.</p>

    <p>I can only find an opportunity to pawn these two things.</p>

    <p>As for now, it is more important to work honestly.</p>

    <p>The entire job task is like this. On the day of the job, he needs to complete the identification of ten items. If he successfully identifies an item, he will automatically receive an ingot of silver. Finally, additional bonuses will be calculated based on the accuracy of the task.</p>

    <p>If he had answered with options just now, then the number of items identified would be only five. And if the identification is successful, he can only get 500 copper coins. There is no additional bonus.</p>

    <p>This difference is quite big.</p>

    <p>So below. His journey to work officially begins...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Although Wang Ling has obtained the entire General's Mansion in Fuyun Town, in this current situation, He Zeng is not working...</p>

    <p>In essence, there is no difference from being a worker.</p>

    <p>And teaching disciples this kind of thing. Wang Ling has felt very tiring. Zhuo Yi can save myself some worry. But when I meet someone who has no talent, sometimes I really feel helpless.</p>

    <p>This also makes Wang Ling understand why some teachers in schools often get annoyed with some students who really cannot teach them...</p>

    <p>A while ago Wang Ling also saw some videos of parents helping their children with their homework. showed a mental breakdown.</p>

    <p>"General, people have been brought here? Aren't you curious. Is the person under this armor a man or a woman? If it is as the rumors say, this is a violation of military regulations and requires the death penalty!" At this time, see Sun Rong and Wang Ling did not talk to each other for a long time. The guard who brought Sun Rong over there stood up at this time.</p>

    <p>He is here to advance the plot.</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Wang Ling silently rolled his eyes. Then he waved his hand at the guard and shouted: "You. Get out."</p>

    <p>He already knew that the one in the armor was Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>So it doesn't matter at all.</p>

    <p>The guard was frustrated. He scratched his head and left angrily.</p>

    <p>But at this time, Sun Rong took the initiative to stand up and said: "Well, General... I see that you have been training the children for a long time, but it seems to have no effect. Do you want me to try instead?"</p>
