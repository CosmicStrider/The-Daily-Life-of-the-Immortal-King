  <h1>Chapter 1441 Boss Sun's Reasoning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything was ready. The next thing Sun Rong had to do that night was naturally to pick out a set of decent clothes suitable for going out on the weekend.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er saw that there were many styles in the girl's wardrobe. Many of them were global limited editions created by famous designers. She was a little puzzled by Sun Rong's behavior of browsing the mall to choose clothes in the middle of the night.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Ying'er finally understands the reason why every time a good-looking new skin is released for the characters in those games, a group of people try to sell the skin to get the skin.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Inspiration comes from life.</p>

    <p>The benefits of implanting skin functions in games are indeed huge.</p>

    <p>The game company may just spend a few thousand yuan to design a skin. After it is put on the shelf, it is priced at 5 yuan and can sell hundreds of millions of copies...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that everyone who buys the skin feels that the money they spent is well worth it!</p>

    <p>It's just too real!</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. You have so many clothes. If you wear any outfit on the street, you will be blinded!" Sun Ying'er sat next to Sun Rong. Looking at the girl who was choosing clothes, she said helplessly.</p>

    <p>"These clothes are too outstanding... They are too high-profile to wear. My classmate Wang Ling may not like them. So I might as well buy some new ones." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>The clothes she picked this time were all new models from small brands. Although they were not as famous as the ones in her wardrobe, for the current situation, as long as they looked good, it was fine.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er pursed his lips.</p>

    <p>She had a complaint in her mind that she didn't know whether to say or not.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there are Chen Chao and the others who are going together... Then if everyone wears school uniforms, wouldn't it be over?</p>

    <p>So. This is just an excuse to buy new clothes!</p>

    <p>Snort!</p>

    <p>Woman!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er raised the corners of her lips slightly and sneered in her heart. There was a look in her eyes that had seen through everything.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong travel. It is actually a big deal for Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>After the last Shadow Stream incident, the old man naturally paid more attention to the protection of his precious granddaughter.</p>

    <p>And before every trip, buy a lot of new clothes. This is actually a very important signal.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun quickly became aware of Sun Rong's travel plan. He called Jiang Xiaoche overnight: "Rongrong seems to be going out. Do you know where she is going?"</p>

    <p>"Miss, did you buy new clothes again..."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Boss Sun nodded: "It's just this time. I don't know where she wants to go yet."</p>

    <p>"That's weird." Jiang Xiaoche frowned: "In the past, young ladies would report in advance when they went out..."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps Rongrong doesn't want to be too high-profile this time. After all, there are a large number of security personnel and convoys accompanying him every time he travels. I thought about it recently. It does feel a bit ostentatious. It's like telling those who are trying to do evil things to Rongrong directly. Rongrong is traveling. Come and assassinate him." Sun Yiyuan said.</p>

    <p>In fact, Boss Sun is indeed reflecting on his past behavior these days.</p>

    <p>After all, there are still many people who hate the rich these days. Some people live a high-profile life and it is easy to attract hatred.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt that Wang Ling was low-key. In fact, there were advantages to being low-key.</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>His granddaughter would definitely report to him before traveling in the past. And he would also prepare various security measures in advance after reporting.</p>

    <p>But now Rongrong has kept silent about his upcoming trip.</p>

    <p>Does that mean that she also wants to keep a low profile on this trip?</p>

    <p>After reasoning to this point, Boss Sun suddenly realized: "That's it!"</p>

    <p>"What did the master think of?"</p>

    <p>"I guess...Rongrong might want to ask classmate Wang Ling out." Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>"..." Jiang Xiaoche was silent. Suddenly, he felt that his mood was no longer beautiful.</p>

    <p>It's this kid again...</p>

    <p>He didn't know. What's so good about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The eldest lady actually likes him so much.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling could hear Boss Sun's words at this moment, he would definitely be filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>This old man's reasoning rarely hits the mark once. It's really not easy...</p>

    <p>Reasoning up to this part.</p>

    <p>Everything sounds reasonable.</p>

    <p>However, with the ancestral brain-compensation ability inherited from the Sun family, if you continue to reason, it is 100% that you will go astray...</p>

    <p>So, after getting Sun Yiyuan's calculation, Jiang Xiaoche spent more than twenty minutes investigating the matter.</p>

    <p>It didn't take long to get an idea.</p>

    <p>"Sir, I've found out. The eldest lady is indeed going on a trip. It's to Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. But she's not just meeting with classmates Wang Ling. There are also three other classmates from Number 60 High School." Jiang Xiaoche said on the phone replied.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not too difficult to get this news.</p>

    <p>Because the eldest lady had done something very strange before. She asked him to help recover the 68 game accounts that ranked first in the server.</p>

    <p>At that time, Jiang Xiaoche had an eye on it.</p>

    <p>Because this type of game is definitely not the type that Sun Rong likes...</p>

    <p>Then, he followed the clues and found Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>After receiving some benefits from Jiang Xiaoche, these two unscrupulous people directly explained the matter directly.</p>

    <p>"Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street?" Boss Sun heard this place and suddenly fell into a flash of memories.</p>

    <p>My impression of this ancient street is that it is full of simplicity and literary atmosphere.</p>

    <p>You can tell at a glance that this is the place chosen by low-key people like classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The old man remembered that he and his first love had also been to a place like this. He suddenly felt that Wang Ling had quite the charm of his youth... He was worthy of being his classmate Wang Ling! Even the place he chose to date. It's so similar...</p>

    <p>"But sir, if the eldest lady is dating that Wang Ling, why did she date three other people at the same time?" Over the phone, Jiang Xiaoche heard Boss Sun sigh with emotion. He immediately knew that the old man was probably narcissistic again. I was hit. I couldn't help wiping my sweat and asked.</p>

    <p>This sentence interrupted Mr. Boss Sun's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Now, although the ins and outs of the whole thing are not very clear, the old man still knows everything by virtue of his strong reasoning ability.</p>

    <p>"The truth. There is only one!"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun said: "Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. This is the first choice for literary and artistic people. And this trip is most likely the decision of classmate Wang Ling. The reason why I also asked three other classmates to go. They must be classmates. Wang Ling made this decision in order to alleviate the embarrassment when traveling!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And if everyone goes out in a group, they can also look after each other to a certain extent and avoid danger..."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun sighed and nodded with satisfaction: "As expected of classmate Wang Ling. He thought of it so thoughtfully!"</p>
