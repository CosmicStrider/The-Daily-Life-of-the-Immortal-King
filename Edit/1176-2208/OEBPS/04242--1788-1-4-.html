  <h1>Chapter 1788 I swear that the title of the next chapter will be changed: The Death of Meili</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing Zhuo Yi trying to give "Yu" to her for self-defense. Jiugong Liangzi immediately felt a sore nose: "You gave me your Yu, what will you do?"</p>

    <p>"I'm fine. Senior Jin Deng, senior Li Xian and senior Zhang Zhui can't get out anyway. They will be responsible for protecting my safety. The most important thing now is you..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held Jiugong Liangzi's hand. Then he kissed her gently on the forehead: "Glio City is very complicated. Contact us at any time. Be careful in everything."</p>

    <p>"Nothing is more important than your own safety. You have to protect yourself. If someone bullies you, when my entry and exit restrictions are lifted later, I will go there in person to find that person..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I understand..." Jiugong Liangzi nodded. Then she kissed Zhuo Yi back on the cheek.</p>

    <p>Only Zhou Ziyi was left behind, eating dog food and shivering.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi knew that this action was by no means that simple, because it had risen to the level of a game between Mixiu Country and Huaxiu Country. It was no longer a competition between forces or sects in the past.</p>

    <p>She hasn't digested the whole thing yet. She only got a general idea from Zhuo Yi's dictation. At the same time, she also clearly knows that if the Jiugong family gets involved in the matter this time, the most dangerous situation may be a careless one. The entire Jiugong family will become a victim in the struggle of the country.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi was not afraid. Although there were various struggles with Sun Rong in the past. But now that the Jiugong family has formed an alliance with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. As the head of the Jiugong family and one of the allies, she naturally does not sit back and ignore it.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi didn't know where she got the courage to face all this. But at the moment when she saw Zhuo Yi suffering from this, she suddenly felt such an impulse in her heart.</p>

    <p>She suddenly realized that she seemed to really like Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>And she likes it even more than she imagined.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Chilan Society Headquarters. Chilan Society President Levis is feeling proud that his plan has succeeded. With the help of St. Peter's Church, he used the bribed truck driver to successfully accuse the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, Sun Rong, with murder was a huge success.</p>

    <p>To be honest, even Levi's didn't expect things to go so smoothly.</p>

    <p>"I knew the church was very strong, but I didn't expect that the church could cover the sky with one hand like this." In the president's office, Levis smoked a cigar. Facing the church nun Alley, who was affiliated with the Tengu, he expressed his praise without concealment.</p>

    <p>"This is just the initial cooperation. If President Levi is interested in Tengu, he can become a member of Tengu." Sister Alley said with a calm smile.</p>

    <p>Levis burst out laughing: "It's not impossible to join the Tengu. I have to think about it. After all, I never had the idea of being a dog before. But now it seems that if there is a strong backer behind it, this may also be a kind of fun."</p>

    <p>"Compared with these, what I am more curious about now is what will the Tengu do next? And who is the senior standing behind your Tengu?"</p>

    <p>"The seniors standing behind us will only be known when President Levi makes it clear and joins us."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley replied calmly: "But our next action plan can be shared with President Levi unconditionally."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Come and listen."</p>

    <p>"As far as we know, the conflict between the Chilan Society and the Huaguo Shuilian Group is nothing more than the reluctance to pay protection fees after the volute changed hands, leaving the Chilan Society without a sustainable economic chain to collect funds."</p>

    <p>"Then. I wonder if President Levi knows about Huaguo Shuilian Group's sudden acquisition of Volute Shell. And what is the purpose of the Huaguo Shuilian Group's eldest lady suddenly coming all the way to enter Glio City?"</p>

    <p>These words made Levis frown. He chuckled: "It's not surprising that such a consortium lady wants to go anywhere."</p>

    <p>"She was still studying in a cultivation school called Number 60 High School. At this time, she suddenly went abroad. According to our investigation, in the final analysis, it was actually for a child.</p>

    <p>"Sister Alley said: "And according to our current reliable information, she invited many classmates to go to Glio City this time. The father of the child may be among these classmates..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Levi was so frightened that he almost dropped his cigar. His eyes suddenly opened wide with an incredulous look. He couldn't believe what he heard: "This... is this true or false?"</p>

    <p>He does not doubt the intelligence capabilities of the Tengu. This is currently the most famous intelligence gathering agency in the world. Moreover, the Tengu represented by Sister Alley is still part of the Tengu core team. The error rate of intelligence is almost negligible.</p>

    <p>"Are the eldest ladies of today's consortium all playing in such fancy ways... How old are they..."</p>

    <p>"These are just the intelligence we have collected so far. But it still lacks verification."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But the child and the child's father are both on this trip. And we are currently confining them to Glio City. As long as we catch them all and ask them one by one, we will know. Or maybe we don't need to do it ourselves. By secretly collecting some DNA samples, we can also get corresponding evidence."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said: "There are many ways. The following matters need to be arranged by President Levi. It is not convenient for us Tengu to come forward for this matter. President Levi's layout of entertainment venues in Glio City can be said to be black and white. I believe it. President Levi will give us a satisfactory answer to our cooperation."</p>

    <p>Levi's frowned: "But this matter is actually risky, isn't it? I remember the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. But there is a hidden master..."</p>

    <p>"It seems that President Li knows a lot."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said: "In fact, we Tengu are planning not to take action for this reason. The expert is someone sent by the Office of Strategic Deception. Her name is Wang Piaoliang. But so far we have no information about it. Any entry and exit records of this Wang Piaoliang."</p>

    <p>"Did she come here through smuggling?" Levis asked.</p>

    <p>"This is just one possibility."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said: "There is another possibility that this Wang Piaoliang is actually one of the classmates brought by Miss Sun this time. In other words, President Li's next task is to find the child. In addition to father, he also has to help us lead out the Wang Piaoliang who is hiding behind... Whether she is smuggled in or hidden inside, these two wolves... President Li must catch..."</p>

    <p>"I'll try my best." Levis smiled.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that this situation would actually turn into a werewolf killing in the end...</p>
