  <h1>Chapter 1487 The atmosphere has become strange</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As Wang Ming's personal bodyguard. Like most cultivators, Zhai Yin does not need to rest at all under normal circumstances.</p>

    <p>Her mission is to protect Wang Ming and assist Wang Ming in some experimental work.</p>

    <p>In addition, if Wang Ming is found to have conducted relatively dangerous experiments, Zhai Yin will also consider reporting the issue to his superiors.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming actually doesn't hate Zhai Yin. But sometimes Zhai Yin is too rigid in doing things. And the key is that he can't explain many things to Zhai Yin. This also creates some communication barriers.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ming thought of a way.</p>

    <p>He specially invented the "sleep cabin", a magic weapon for cultivation with a slightly black technological attribute.</p>

    <p>Although cultivators can stay awake for long periods of time, their attention will inevitably be distracted while their bodies are constantly working. Over time, it may even have a certain impact on their spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>There are not many side effects. It is nothing more than overdrafting the body in advance, leading to reduced mental concentration, rough skin and other problems.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ming's sleeping cabin is a prop specially used in this situation.</p>

    <p>Sleeping in the sleeping cabin for 5 minutes is as effective as sleeping for 24 hours. It allows the cultivator to quickly complete the charge.</p>

    <p>The sleeping cabin currently invented by Wang Ming can be divided into home type and capsule type.</p>

    <p>Capsule-type sleeping cabins have been put into military use.</p>

    <p>As long as the capsule is still on the ground and is shaken, it will automatically expand and then turn into a sleeping capsule that can accommodate one person.</p>

    <p>Recycling is also a one-button operation. Press the designated button to recompress it back to its capsule form.</p>

    <p>Now, Wang Ming has successfully applied for a patent for the sleeping cabin.</p>

    <p>After it was officially announced for military use, there were a lot of orders from the military factory. This was also the source of Wang Ming's experimental funds.</p>

    <p>Counting only Huaxiu's previous warehouse orders, there are billions.</p>

    <p>No money. Just get some gadgets. Make a little money...that's all.</p>

    <p>As the most powerful brain, developing new products is never difficult for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Of course. On the surface, he invented the sleeping cabin to serve the military. But in fact, his original purpose of inventing the sleeping cabin was to restrict Zhai Yin...</p>

    <p>There were many experiments that Zhai Yin wouldn't let him do because they were dangerous. So in this case, all he had to do was lock Zhai Yin in the sleeping cabin.</p>

    <p>Although Zhai Yin is a tomboy, she is still a girl who loves beauty.</p>

    <p>Not sleeping for a long time is bad for the skin. Needless to say, Wang Ming and Zhai Yin also know.</p>

    <p>So after the sleeping cabin was invented, Zhai Yin almost habitually used it. And Wang Ming also found out the usage rules of Zhai Yin. While Zhai Yin was resting, he conducted many secret experiments.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Zhai Yin should still be inside...</p>

    <p>The look with a hint of murderous intent instantly made Wang Ming tremble.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to be an expert in love? Why have I never heard of you before?" Zhai Yin's face was filled with gloom. All her attention was on Wang Ming's words.</p>

    <p>I don't care who Wang Ming is discussing the topic of "emotion" with.</p>

    <p>After she woke up, she heard Wang Ying's voice outside. She only knew that the voice was obviously not Wang Ling. It was probably Wang Ming talking to one of her friends on the speakerphone?</p>

    <p>She doesn't care who he calls.</p>

    <p>However, as an official magic weapon researcher, Wang Ming is an academician, but he is also a magic weapon consultant specially hired by the military!</p>

    <p>This is a character in the establishment!</p>

    <p>Since Zhai Yin thinks it is necessary to pay attention to the issue of life style.</p>

    <p>"Yinzi, listen to me... things are not what you think..." Wang Ming's forehead was covered with sweat. He didn't know why he was in a hurry to explain these problems to Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>I just feel that if I don't explain it, the consequences may be serious.</p>

    <p>Because he found that whenever Zhai Yin was in a bad mood, she would cook to vent her emotions.</p>

    <p>And he is the guinea pig of "In-style cuisine."</p>

    <p>As for how terrible Zhai Yin's food is, Wang Ming doesn't think he needs any additional explanation.</p>

    <p>That thing is not only toxic...it's a "corpse powder!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that after eating it, his whole body would be melted by the "violent poison."</p>

    <p>So combined with the concept of mathematics. Wang Ming also called it: factoring...</p>

    <p>That night, seeing that a big battle was inevitable, Wang Ling was too lazy to make do. He quickly left the laboratory, leaving the space for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He was not worried that Wang Ming would die.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ming now has the blessing of "Great Luck Technique." Even if Zhai Yin uses force, there is a high probability that Wang Ming will continue to be "missed"...</p>

    <p>However, the effect of "Great Luck Technique" only lasts for one week.</p>

    <p>After this week, Wang Ming's life will surely become extremely exciting.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's still Sunday, December 13th.</p>

    <p>At eight o'clock this morning. Wang Ling first sent a message to Wang Ming to confirm whether he was still alive.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming praised him for his "Great Luck Technique": "Brother. Your technique is too strong. After you left yesterday, Yinzi was furious and gave me a set of Wing Chun. In the end, not a single punch hit me!"</p>

    <p>I knew it was like this...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was not surprised by the expected result.</p>

    <p>He responded to Wang Ming with several brief messages.</p>

    <p>The general idea is to tell Wang Ming to take it easy. Don't be a bitch.</p>

    <p>Because the spell's duration is limited...</p>

    <p>If you go too far now, it will be Wang Ming himself who will suffer when the statute of limitations expires.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling normally, disdains to use the "Great Luck Technique" on himself. Because doing so will make life very boring.</p>

    <p>As for this technique, Wang Ling does not intend to use it on others easily unless there is any special need.</p>

    <p>Because for ordinary people, the ability of "Qi Luck" may be very effective for a while. However, if you are used to Qi Luck, it will also cause dependence.</p>

    <p>In fact. It's not just a dependency.</p>

    <p>Except for Wang Ling himself, everyone else uses this technique. The effect of increasing luck will continue to decrease... The more frequently it is used, the faster it will decrease.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is a capable person.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of air luck, it is like adding wings to a tiger, the icing on the cake.</p>

    <p>But frequent use is not necessary.</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong slept for a long time.</p>

    <p>When she woke up, she found herself lying on the big bed in the hotel's presidential suite. Sun Ying'er was taking care of her: "Rongrong, are you awake?"</p>

    <p>"I'm... What's wrong..." The girl got up. She looked at the nightgown she was wearing and wondered, "Who changed my clothes?</p>

    <p>"Of course it's Ling Zhenren." Sun Ying'er said with a bad smile: "You were so tired yesterday that you passed out. Ling Zhenren brought you here. You took a shower and changed clothes..."</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling! This, this, this. How can this be possible!" Sun Rong covered her mouth. Her face lost its color.</p>

    <p>"You're kidding. Of course it's all my fault!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er looked aggrieved: "You know Rongrong. My waist is not very good..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But then again. Are you expecting something?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately felt his face burning to his ears: "I didn't..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although I didn't manage to get alone with Wang Ling yesterday, I was still surprised when Sun Rong saw that Wang Ling left a sack of toffee for herself.</p>

    <p>Although there are regrets in my heart, I am more happy and joyful.</p>

    <p>After accepting a sack of toffee, Sun Rong was in a great mood.</p>

    <p>It was approaching noon that day. The girl was preparing to check out at the front desk on the first floor. When the elevator went down to the third floor, it suddenly stopped.</p>

    <p>When he opened the door, Sun Rong saw Jiugong Liangzi and Zhuo Yi. They were wearing the same Hanfu and were standing at the elevator door.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had a surprised expression on his face. It was so exciting.</p>

    <p>As expected of senior Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>This is too fast!</p>

    <p>However, the atmosphere at this time seemed a bit stiff.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the elevator reached the first floor that he heard the "ding" sound of the door opening. Sun Rong had the courage to look at Jiugong Liangzi tentatively and asked, "Jiugong, can I ask you a question?" ?"</p>

    <p>"Ask." Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, have you... been captured by senior Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong saw Jiugong Liangzi's originally calm face. It began to gradually change color...</p>
