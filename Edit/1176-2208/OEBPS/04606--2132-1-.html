  <h1>Chapter 2132 The first outside player</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: As the Hundred Cave Demon Lord fell in response, Wang Ling directly obtained the new identity of the Hundred Cave Demon Lord around Fuyun Town. As well as a total of 5,000 demon troops.</p>

    <p>This is the rounded data of Wang Ling. Just round it up. After all, I accidentally killed a few during the attack on the 100-hole area. It would be too troublesome to count it as a fraction.</p>

    <p>When the Baidong Demon Lord dies, these demons no longer have the possibility of being refreshed. There are as many as there are. Wang Ling try to stay as much as possible during the advancement process. And kill the Baidong Demon Lord instantly.</p>

    <p>It is to avoid creating new variables and causing greater damage to this area, thus causing more damage to these little monsters who are regarded as labor force by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling made a decisive decision and killed instantly, avoiding a large-scale battle. Although some losses were still incurred in the process, it was still within the controllable range.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling's move against the boss is even more amazing.</p>

    <p>It's not a simple {health bar clearing technique}. That's just the abbreviation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The real full name is: Regionalized Dynamic Blood Bar Clearing Technique...</p>

    <p>The precise instant kill of this move allowed Wang Ling to stop the loss as much as possible. Unfortunately, such accuracy... is difficult to achieve in the real world.</p>

    <p>After all, the current Wang Ling is in the game world. Although there is the concept of being forcibly debuffed, the current Wang Ling is passive because of its powerful god-level skills. It is equivalent to standing still. In an invincible and invincible place.</p>

    <p>And this invincibility. Because of the game world, he can accurately control this power.</p>

    <p>This feeling of being able to control power made Wang Ling feel doubly amazing. He didn't know how long it would be until the joint research and development team of Wang Ming and Shou Chong could decipher the black stone and develop the latest version of Talisman.</p>

    <p>But he has an intuition. He can clearly feel that this day may not be too far away.</p>

    <p>Within the causal base.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at the actions deduced from the various decisions made by Wang Ling in the monitor. He was already feeding back the data from the game. While using his own brain to back up the human flesh cloud, his fingers continued to enter various codes on his keyboard. Record the deduction.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this wave, Wang Ming's consideration is in the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Letting Wang Ling enter the game to assist Mr. Hidden Fox is only one aspect. The most critical point is that Wang Ming himself wants to use Wang Ling's game data to provide experimental reference for the new Talisman.</p>

    <p>The world of Itinerant Immortal is based on the modern theory system of cultivation. Although it is just a world constructed of countless codes, it is precisely because it strictly follows the theoretical system of scientific cultivation that it has important data. reference significance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Shou Chong stared at the screen intently, entranced. Seeing this, Zhai Yin did not dare to interrupt their thinking easily.</p>

    <p>Men who work hard are always the most handsome.</p>

    <p>And this is what Zhai Yin likes about Wang Ming. When she sees Wang Ming's devoted appearance, she feels proud and feels particularly peaceful.</p>

    <p>How to use Talisman to accurately control the power of Wang Ling to the correct level. This is what Wang Ming is pursuing at this stage. It is difficult...but not completely impossible to achieve.</p>

    <p>After recording the data in the first stage, Wang Ming and Shou Chong put on wireless helmets respectively and exchanged the data they recorded.</p>

    <p>This process is an exchange and deduction. The two people exchange and communicate at the level of thinking and will on the data they have just recorded, so as to check for gaps and errors.</p>

    <p>In this aspect, Shou Chong is not as talented as Wang Ming. But the advantage is that he has lived a lot longer than Wang Ming. He has more experience than Wang Ming. In addition, Shou Chong also has many strange ideas. It can be said that Wang Ming feels inferior to himself. Shou Chong is the person closest to his own thinking characteristics.</p>

    <p>It's like the relationship between the main brain and the deputy brain.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Demon Lord of Hundred Cave was solved. Wang Ling's current labor force has just reached a sufficient level. He originally wanted to push forward to challenge the Demon Lord of Thousand Cave and Ten Thousand Cave Demon Lord.</p>

    <p>It's just that in that case, the distance from Fuyun Town will become farther and farther. Without him in charge, the demon spirit labor force he finally gathered will most likely suffer a devastating blow in his absence. And be destroyed by the rest. Players are given the name of the devil.</p>

    <p>Associating with demons. This is not tolerated in the world of Itinerant Immortal. Just like at this moment, he has just absorbed a new wave of demon labor force. The happiness index of Fuyun Town has dropped again.</p>

    <p>Once the happiness index drops to an extreme, there is always the risk of rebellion.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling's next plan is to return to the city for maintenance first. Increase the population base. Upgrade the town to a high level. Use the demon labor force in hand to expand the buildings in Fuyun Town. Absorb talents. First, increase the happiness index. Let's talk about improving it.</p>

    <p>"General... these equipment..." Sun Rong followed Wang Ling and picked up purple equipment and materials.</p>

    <p>The glazed demon lord's glazed armor (purple), the glazed demon lord's glazed armor (purple), the glazed demon's glazed fragments (purple), the glazed demon's claws (purple), the glazed demon's head horn (purple)...</p>

    <p>These purple equipment can be exchanged for Sun Rong for a large amount of money. They can even cast a new batch of purple equipment. They are very rare materials.</p>

    <p>After killing the Hundred Cave Demon Lord, Sun Rong's character level was instantly raised to level 35.</p>

    <p>The level 35 characters on the Novice Village map... are a bit hard to imagine...</p>

    <p>"For you." Wang Ling didn't say much. Under the mask of Huwei, he was still concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>He was about to take Sun Rong back to the city. But at this moment, Wang Ling suddenly heard a sharp arrow piercing the wind beside his ear. The sound came straight through...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reacted very quickly. He ducked sideways and caught the incoming arrow.</p>

    <p>It's obviously a level 1 NPC...</p>

    <p>Obviously, the archer in the distance was also surprised by Wang Ling's sudden attack. He was also wearing a rare smiling face mask.</p>

    <p>"Orange equipment?" Sun Rong was surprised. This mask exudes a dull golden light. It has equipment special effects. It symbolizes the quality of the equipment worn by this player. It is an orange equipment! Than { The Huwei mask on Wang Ling's face is even more advanced!</p>

    <p>At the same time, she was also surprised. She didn't expect that she would meet a very high-level player in the wild map of Novice Village!</p>

    <p>Although it's not as high as the level 35 she got. But level 33... is still scary in the world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>She gained experience by accident. But this player obviously relied on his own hard work to improve.</p>

    <p>The player was seen wearing a smiling mask that exuded orange special effects. He jumped towards them from the treetops in the distance. The cloak behind him spread out like a glider. It looked like a lightning bird. Against the blue sky, it looked more like He is an angel that shines with light.</p>

    <p>This cloak is also an orange outfit...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked. This is definitely a closed beta player. Otherwise, there would be no way he would have so many rare equipment.</p>

    <p>"interesting."</p>

    <p>After the man landed, he looked at Sun Rong. Then he took off his mask and revealed a spring-like smile. He was very kind. He looked to be in his early thirties.</p>

    <p>"The Novice Village is only level 35. And it also has a level 1 NPC general?" The man touched his chin and looked at Sun Rong. The traditional bow behind him was shining brightly. He was looking at Sun Rong, he was also thinking about what main mission Sun Rong triggered. It actually directly inspired a level 1 NPC general to attack.</p>

    <p>He had been observing from a distance for a long time. It wasn't until he saw Wang Ling destroying the Hundred Cave Demon Lord with one move that he decided to take a look.</p>

    <p>That arrow just now was just a test.</p>

    <p>"It looks like this is your first time meeting other players?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>Looking at Sun Rong's astonished look, the man holding a traditional bow laughed: "The world of Itinerant Immortal is too big. There are so many novice villages. There are also all kinds of plots that can be triggered. There are only one or two players in a village. It's normal. And they can't even recognize each other as real players."</p>

    <p>The man shrugged and said. He spread his hands with a helpless expression. Then he reached out to Sun Rong and said, "Let's get to know each other. My surname is Huang. You can call me Lao Huang."</p>

    <p>After reporting his home address, www.uukanshu.net, a clear character nickname appeared above the man's head. This was the character ID he had set from the beginning of the game.</p>

    <p>And self-reporting is also a direct way for players to recognize each other's identities. It shows a kind of sincerity.</p>

    <p>Just say your chosen name to the player you want to get to know. The other party will be able to permanently see the ID marked above your head.</p>

    <p>"Hello. You can call me Sun Yiyuan."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also laughed and shook Lao Huang's hand.</p>

    <p>It was rare. This was the first veteran player she had met who was willing to tell her whereabouts. And he looked very experienced.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Lao Huang. What is your occupation?"</p>

    <p>"Me? I am a reborn person."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang smiled and showed off the traditional bow he was passionate about: "So, I have no equipment restrictions. As long as I study the character attributes and matching points thoroughly, any equipment can be used."</p>
