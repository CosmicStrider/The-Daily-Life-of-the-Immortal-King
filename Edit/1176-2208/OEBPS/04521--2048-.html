  <h1>Chapter 2048 The Xiufeng Nian... breaks the defense!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Directly severing the contract between the miracle of the universe and its original owner. This is definitely not something that can be done according to logical thinking.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling did it.</p>

    <p>Uncovering the ordinary sealing talisman was actually risky. He did not dare to make any unnecessary moves. If the spiritual energy in his body leaked at this time, it would probably directly cause the collapse of this dilapidated supreme world.</p>

    <p>And once this alien space is destroyed, the entire Sun family's ancestral land will suffer.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was just cautious. He concentrated the power of unsealing the talisman directly on his own pair of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>The dazzling beam of light turned into immortal light and directly broke through the void. It seemed to be dividing the heaven and the earth. It shot out directly from the cracks in the supreme world. It directly mapped a string of ancient words among the endless stars.</p>

    <p>Xiufeng Nian was shocked by this scene. His whole soul trembled.</p>

    <p>This is... the miraculous contract he once signed!</p>

    <p>It is a complete miraculous contract with Bian Shu! It was actually directly manifested under the pupil power of Wang Ling. It was projected into the galaxy of the universe.</p>

    <p>Golden light shone in all directions. It was like a divine sun that illuminated this supreme world. Wang Ling's eye reached into the depths of the universe. It spanned an unknown number of light years. It accurately found the miraculous contract. Every ancient word on this miraculous contract began to burn.</p>

    <p>During the burning process, the beam emitted from Wang Ling's King's Eyes never stopped.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has used the power of King's Eyes in several previous battles, the casting time is definitely not as long as this one.</p>

    <p>Use the divine flames of King's Eyes to burn the miraculous contract. This directly shatters the contract so that there is no longer any connection between Bian Shu and the rotten harvest years. Such a thing is unbelievable just to hear it. However, it is actually happening at this moment. In front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"You damn thing... you actually want to burn my miracle contract!" Xiufeng Nian already knew what Wang Ling was doing. Although he couldn't figure out how Wang Ling did it. But when he noticed that the miracle contract was already burning. No matter how frightened he was about Wang Ling, he had to bite the bullet and go forward.</p>

    <p>How important it is to master a miracle. Only those who have reached his level will understand. If even this trump card is taken away, Xiufeng Nian is very clear. He will never have any hope of rising in the future.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>So even though he knew Wang Ling was terrifying at this moment, he still had to bite the bullet and go forward.</p>

    <p>For Xiufeng Nian, this may also be an opportunity.</p>

    <p>Because it can be seen that the young man is concentrating on using his pupil power to burn the contract. Judging from the time when the miraculous contract disappeared, it will take thirty seconds to burn the contract cleanly.</p>

    <p>These thirty seconds are an excellent opportunity for Xiufeng Nian!</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>The next second, the spiritual power in his hand exploded, and countless light blades were sprayed out. As if they were about to split the world, they flew densely in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. This is a complete failure in the Xiufeng Nian.</p>

    <p>These light blades carry all of his power. The power that leaves no room for anything. It is a single blow thrown by Xiufeng Nian. It is so powerful that even the Dao Ancestor realm cannot survive. He is killed by a light blade. Mixed with spiritual power and chaotic energy, it will instantly expand in the body and explode directly.</p>

    <p>"How long will it take?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"20 seconds." Wang Ling frowned slightly and replied, as concisely as ever.</p>

    <p>Burning the Miracle Contract. This is the first time Wang Ling has done this. He has never had the experience before, so he lacks some control over the speed.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself didn't expect that it would be so difficult to burn this thing.</p>

    <p>Compared to beating Ancestor King realm of Xiufeng Nian, burning the miracle contract seems to be a little more difficult...</p>

    <p>After all, it is a product produced by the will of the universe. It is indeed extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>20 seconds. What exactly can be done? Maybe everyone has their own answer in their hearts.</p>

    <p>But the twenty seconds at this moment are extraordinary for Wang Ling and Xiufeng Nian.</p>

    <p>This will directly determine the fate of part of the world where Wang Ling lives at this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying originally had no intention of taking action.</p>

    <p>But at this moment Wang Ling is focused on burning the Miracle Contract.</p>

    <p>He knew that during these twenty seconds, he had to come out to protect him.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to fight."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said. His voice had that familiar evil quality.</p>

    <p>At the moment when Xiufeng Nian's light blade was about to approach Wang Ling, Xiufeng Nian saw a void black shadow separate from the boy's body. He raised his hand directly in the air and split into an invulnerable black shadow shield. Absorbed all his light blades.</p>

    <p>Then the black shadow gradually condensed into a solid body.</p>

    <p>Xiufeng Nian saw it. It was a boy who looked exactly like Wang Ling. The difference was... his hair color was white. And his whole temperament had a completely different feeling.</p>

    <p>"The Ancestor King realm. Isn't it amazing?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying crossed his arms and looked down at Xiufeng Nian.</p>

    <p>He was always ruthless in his attacks. He didn't have any calculation at all. He barely said a word of nonsense. He directly turned into a black shadow and volleyed towards him. His fist was aimed at Xiufeng Nian's head.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's speed was so fast. The force of his punch was enough to make Xian Fengnian's eyes black. His heart stopped for half a second in a short time.</p>

    <p>Although his reaction was already very fast, before Wang Ying could punch him, he gathered all his spiritual power to add a defensive barrier to his body.</p>

    <p>However, what Xu Fengnian never expected was that the power of Wang Ying's punch was far beyond what he imagined.</p>

    <p>These defensive barriers are completely useless!</p>

    <p>He actually... broke through the defense!</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ying has no intention of stopping the fight. Even if there is less than 15 seconds left, he is still launching a fierce offensive.</p>

    <p>Attack is the best defense.</p>

    <p>This is the defensive principle that Wang Ying has always advocated.</p>

    <p>His eyes were cold. His figure was so fast that he looked like a ghost. He walked around behind Xiufeng Nian and stepped on his back.</p>

    <p>Xiufeng Nian immediately spurted out a large mouthful of blood. Before he could react, he only heard a crisp sound. His Ancestor King-level indestructible body, his arm was broken like chopsticks by this ruthless white-haired boy.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru and Immortal Toya were all stunned. Especially Sun Ru. She felt like she could hardly breathe.</p>

    <p>Is this really the head of their Sun family?</p>

    <p>Why is it so outrageous!</p>

    <p>Everything is so shocking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's attacks continued, leaving no room for thinking for Xiufeng Nian. A series of combos and critical strikes. The Ancestor King's limbs were broken one after another. Xiufeng Nian was beaten so hard that he had no chance to backhand.</p>

    <p>He saw it.</p>

    <p>This White Hair boy is actually the shadow of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even the shadow is so strong...</p>

    <p>This body of yours. Were you just playing with me just now?</p>

    <p>The mentality of Xiufeng Nian completely collapsed.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ying finally pulled up Xiufeng Nian's collar, he raised the corners of his lips and asked with a smile: "Run. Why don't you run?"</p>

    <p>Chasing people is what he is best at.</p>

    <p>These are all the results of practicing the "Planet thumping technique" in the infinite galaxy by capturing Sun Ying'er day and night.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Xiufeng Nian looked desperate.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ying was here to delay time. In order to wait for the miracle contract to be completely burned.</p>

    <p>It's just that he would never have imagined that the moment he saw the last words on the miraculous contract being burned.</p>

    <p>He felt relieved inside. He felt like he was breathing a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The burning is finally finished...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he will continue to be beaten...</p>
