  <h1>Chapter 1759 The backbone of Tengu</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Jiang Yingying beat Yin Hu terribly.</p>

    <p>Yes. She only beat Yin Hu. Because every injustice has its own debtor. The only person who beat her before was Yin Hu, so only Yin Hu should pay these debts.</p>

    <p>During the entire process of Yin Hu being brutally beaten, several of Yin Hu's subordinates, represented by Kangaroo, although their bodies had been buried in the ground, with only their heads exposed, the fear that touched their souls was unspoken. And metaphorical.</p>

    <p>They never expected that a girl in the Foundation Building stage would be so powerful after a layer of sword energy was coated on her palms... Yin Hu was so beaten that his nose was bruised and his face was swollen. He also seemed to have suffered serious internal injuries.</p>

    <p>The Yin Hu was beaten until he vomited blood. The amount of bleeding was extremely large. The blood was not flowing at all, but it was sprayed out directly. It was like a fountain!</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiang Yingying cannot be entirely blamed for this.</p>

    <p>After all, with her first slap, Yin Hu felt as if his face had been run over by a truck.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong ultimately underestimated the power of the nine-core Aohai.</p>

    <p>Even though the sword light coating attached to Jiang Yingying's palm is only a very small part of Aohai's power, it's not an exaggeration to take a drop in the ocean as an example.</p>

    <p>But when it really fell on Yin Hu, only Yin Hu himself knew the sour feeling.</p>

    <p>Finally, before Yin Hu completely fainted, Sun Rong took action to stop Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Revenge is revenge. Beating people to death is not good.</p>

    <p>Then she poured Aohai's healing sword energy into Yin Hu's body to restore his injuries.</p>

    <p>When the warm sword energy entered the body, Yin Hu's consciousness, which was about to faint, suddenly woke up.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was one of astonishment.</p>

    <p>He thought to himself that these two girls were tough characters.</p>

    <p>They actually want to cure him in order to beat him up again...</p>

    <p>What kind of devils are these?</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Yin Hu. We will not attack you again. But for all the crimes you committed in Xiaotian League, please tell the truth to the police in the future." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She has already notified the Office of Strategic Deception. However, since this is a private operation, neither the police nor the Office of Strategic Deception will send people over on a large scale to avoid alerting the enemy.</p>

    <p>On the surface, this matter seems to have made Roaring Heavenly Alliance suffer a dumb loss.</p>

    <p>And next, her task is to transfer Yin Hu and others to her own sword spirit space and take them away directly.</p>

    <p>Hearing the news that he would not be beaten, Yin Hu felt relieved. But he couldn't be happy at all. His face was still full of worry.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Yin Hu. Do you have any questions?" Sun Rong asked upon seeing this.</p>

    <p>"I was thinking. Even if you really take me away and send me to the police, whether I can survive is still a question." Yin Hu sighed.</p>

    <p>From the moment when he and his men were subdued by Sun Rong and there was no movement from the Roaring Sky Alliance, Yin Hu already knew his end.</p>

    <p>He knew he had been given up.</p>

    <p>"You mean. The Roaring Heavenly Alliance will come to kill you?"Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Ha. The Roaring Sky Alliance is just a branch. Even if the Roaring Sky Alliance is taken away by you today and falls down, there will be other alliances that will become new branches and grow again..."</p>

    <p>"So, the Tengu are the backbone."</p>

    <p>"You're absolutely right..."</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Yin Hu sighed: "Tengu are all over the world. Unless we kill them all, this leader of underground intelligence will always be controlled by the Tengu... You rush in here. They should already know the news. But again No one was sent to rescue me and my subordinates..."</p>

    <p>"So you think. You've been given up."</p>

    <p>"Yes. That's right... and..."</p>

    <p>"Even if you send me to prison, it may not be safe." Yin Hu looked at the nine-tailed fox mask of Sun Rong and said, "Because. Even if you send me to prison, there is no guarantee. There are in the prison, Tengu people."</p>

    <p>Tengu people have penetrated so widely?</p>

    <p>Does it even exist in prison?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>I feel this is very useful information.</p>

    <p>However, as the trunk of a big tree, not everyone can become a member of the Tengu. The existence of the Tengu itself is actually a symbol of the elite. If we take Songhai City Number 1 Prison as an example, those senior jailers have had high IQs in the past. Prisoners of technological crimes. They may all be members of Tengu...</p>

    <p>But in that case, the scope of the investigation would be too broad.</p>

    <p>No wonder the International Cultivator Alliance issued a notice before, requiring cultivator alliances in various countries to pay close attention to the Tengu's movements and seize the opportunity to catch this group of people.</p>

    <p>Because if we completely let it go and allow the Tengu to grow infinitely, this group of people will indeed become a considerable threat.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the people who can support and operate such a huge organization are probably not just ordinary little players.</p>

    <p>"So, who is the senior standing behind you?" Sun Rong asked again.</p>

    <p>She had already sensed the extraordinary nature of the person behind the scenes. She knew that he was probably also an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>"Such a thing. How can I know about this senior level? I just know that this senior has extraordinary methods." Yin Hu smiled and said: "You have to find out about this senior. At least you have to catch the Tengu. And the level is even higher."</p>

    <p>"Are there still levels among Tengu?"</p>

    <p>"Of course there are levels. The higher the level of Tengu, the larger the intelligence network it can manipulate. As far as I know, there are ten levels in total. Level ten is the highest level."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu said: "Our Tengu division in Duobao City, that is, the third-grade Tengu. I guess we don't know the news about the seniors behind the scenes. If you want to know more, you must at least catch the fifth-grade or above. But I'm afraid you won't even be able to see the tengu who are above the fifth rank. They are well hidden."</p>

    <p>These words are highly credible.</p>

    <p>After all, Yin Hu and others are now in a life-threatening situation. If they want to survive, they can only tell the truth.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong is also curious about something. That is that this group of Yin Hu people did not try their best.</p>

    <p>"According to common sense, shouldn't you be tight-lipped and swear to death?"</p>

    <p>"This is natural. We have our professional ethics. And there is no one in our family. We have no blood relatives. We have no worries."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu said: "The same goes for me, the kangaroo over there, and everyone else... I'm the leader of this group of people, and a collective punishment curse has actually been planted on my body. Once something happens to me, as long as the forbidden curse is activated, all of us will be finished."</p>

    <p>"But you're still alive, are you cured?"</p>

    <p>"Not really..."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu's face darkened and he smiled helplessly: "Just now, Miss Jiang slapped me one after another, and it broke apart..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
