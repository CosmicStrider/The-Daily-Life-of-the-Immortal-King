  <h1>Chapter 1305 Group Status-1</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the other side, Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen, and Liu Qingyi were sent to carry out the task of capturing the second son of the void.</p>

    <p>Because the identity could not be determined at present, the three people decided to catch all the suspected subjects and then conduct observation.</p>

    <p>Once these suspected objects begin to smell like void creatures.</p>

    <p>Then the identity of the Son of the Void is completely confirmed.</p>

    <p>Based on the inference results from the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p>In the end, the suspects focused on Jiang Xiaoche and Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>One is Boss Sun's personal secretary.</p>

    <p>And the other one is the adopted son of Sword Master Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>Since it is not clear which one of the two is the Son of the Void, Lord Diulei's opinion is: capture them both.</p>

    <p>And the kind that doesn't reveal its flaws.</p>

    <p>Because no matter which one of these two people disappears, it may cause unnecessary trouble.</p>

    <p>"Lord Ma has completed the docking. The fake bodies of Yi Zhiyang and Jiang Xiaoche are ready. When we kidnap them, we will just put on the fake bodies." Gu Shunzhi said to Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi. action plan.</p>

    <p>"I've already seen that fake body. But these two people are still alive. What's the use of just changing bodies." Wang Zhen asked.</p>

    <p>"These two fake bodies are more advanced and can be manipulated. There are specialized actors behind the scenes. It is said that they are actors carefully selected from within the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi said: "Do you know those virtual anchors on the Internet who use two-dimensional AI to change faces?"</p>

    <p>"Oh you said that!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>They have all seen similar live broadcasts before. Even live broadcast accidents.</p>

    <p>This is a technology that can completely replace Zhenren into a two-dimensional virtual anchor.</p>

    <p>You can find someone alone to draw the character you want.</p>

    <p>Then all we need is Zhenren to perform from behind.</p>

    <p>During the live broadcast, all sounds and expressions will be intelligently captured by AI and then fed back to the set virtual anchor.</p>

    <p>However, when this technology first came out, "rollover" accidents often occurred.</p>

    <p>For example, you are watching with relish a two-dimensional virtual cute girl dancing in the live broadcast room.</p>

    <p>As a result, the live broadcast room suddenly stalled.</p>

    <p>The real host behind the performance hiding under this virtual software will be revealed in an instant.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's an aunt over fifty years old.</p>

    <p>Or maybe he's a fat nerd with acne on his face and a big belly...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Luo Pangzi would integrate such technology into his own simulated body technology... What a pity he is a pervert!" After listening to Gu Shunzhi's introduction, Wang Zhen's expression was greatly surprised.</p>

    <p>In response, Gu Shunzhi also nodded: "Boss Luo is indeed a rare talent. It's a pity that he is a pervert!"</p>

    <p>"It's a pity that he is a pervert. Has this sentence become a suffix to describe Boss Luo?"</p>

    <p>Hearing the conversation between the two men, Liu Qingyi took the initiative to defend Luo Pangzi: "Boss Luo, what a good person! He is quick and witty. How can you say that about him! What a pity he is a pervert!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen, Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first kidnapping target was Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang is relatively easy to tie.</p>

    <p>Because since competing in the Jiulongshan Physical Martial Arts Competition, Yi Zhiyang is still in a state of autism and has not recovered.</p>

    <p>Now I am still lying in the hospital. Apart from receiving infusions every day and receiving regular counseling from a psychologist in a daze, there is nothing else to do.</p>

    <p>So the person in charge of the connection, the Office of Strategic Deception, also found it very easy to act.</p>

    <p>Acting with facial paralysis like this is the least challenging.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi and the three men cut through the mess quickly and tied up Yi Zhiyang soon.</p>

    <p>Then he cooperated with Lord Ma to place the simulated Yi Zhiyang on the hospital bed.</p>

    <p>"There is one left." Gu Shunzhi said.</p>

    <p>And this remaining one is also the most troublesome one...</p>

    <p>Because the situation is different from that of Yi Zhiyang. After all, Jiang Xiaoche is a person with the ability to act. And he is also very defensive.</p>

    <p>There were always men in black following him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we must find the time node when Jiang Xiaoche is alone.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen, and Liu Qingyi pretended to be employees of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Wearing employee uniforms, they waited for a full afternoon before they found a chance for Jiang Xiaoche to go to the toilet alone.</p>

    <p>"The time has come. I'll leave this matter to you." Gu Shunzhi said to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>"Why me..."</p>

    <p>"I'm thinking about you."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi said earnestly: "In the final analysis, we are all working for Ling Zhenren. You have to express yourself more to win Ling Zhenren's favor. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"that is!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi smiled evilly: "Senior Gu was originally the commander of this operation. That place is also a men's toilet. You don't have to let me go there as a girl!"</p>

    <p>This call of "Senior Gu" made Gu Shunzhi feel extremely complicated...</p>

    <p>After Liu Qingyi said this, he also received a big eye roll from Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>When I usually go to the toilet, why would you just break in through the door?</p>

    <p>Now I think of myself as a girl...</p>

    <p>But in the end, Wang Zhen gritted his teeth and said, "Just go!"</p>

    <p>Among the three people from their divine realm, Wang Zhen felt that his status was indeed the lowest.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Zhen named his network ID like this: Humble Wang Zhen. Earth Survival.</p>

    <p>Eight short words fully express Wang Zhen's current life status.</p>

    <p>He felt that what Gu Shunzhi said actually made sense.</p>

    <p>The so-called hard work means long life. It's better to hug Wang Ling's thigh...</p>

    <p>If I try harder to please Ling Zhenren, I'm afraid my status will really get lower and lower!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the men's restroom. The outside is guarded by several bodyguards in black.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen couldn't break through directly from the main entrance, so he had to find a hidden position and planned to dodge over the wall.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen knows a lot of Heavenly Dao spells. But many of them were learned by Wang Zhen quickly because of his quick practice.</p>

    <p>So most of them have two knives.</p>

    <p>For example, this move "Big Flash." His performance is not very stable.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen just hopes that he won't appear in some weird position...</p>

    <p>In the toilet, Jiang Xiaoche is facing the urinal.</p>

    <p>He had just unzipped his pants. Before he could take it out, a hand stretched out from the urinal and grabbed his hand: "Brother... calm down! Don't pee!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen sighed.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he flashed into a strange position...</p>

    <p>That's right. He flashed into the urinal.</p>

    <p>And what's worse is that Jiang Xiaoche is about to take out his own faucet and aim it at him.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen made a prompt decision and reached out to stop Jiang Xiaoche's behavior.</p>

    <p>Oh my god!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was frightened on the spot. All parts of his body were frightened...</p>

    <p>A person suddenly jumped out of the urinal. The level of panic was no different from that of Sadako crawling out of the TV.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't have time to scream.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen then struck Jiang Xiaoche unconscious with a strike of his knife.</p>

    <p>Although the start was unfavorable, it was a near miss.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>

    <p>Preparing to wait for Lord Ma to transmit.</p>

    <p>As a result, he suddenly saw a silver vortex beginning to gather in front of his eyes...</p>

    <p>"This is?" Wang Zhen was confused.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma's teleportation has always been a golden beam of light. When were the teleportation effects modified?</p>

    <p>He was surprised.</p>

    <p>A fat man fell heavily on the toilet tiles with a "snap."</p>

    <p>The fat man was frothing at the mouth. It looked like he was suffering from motion sickness because the "vehicle speed" of the space teleportation was too fast.</p>

    <p>"Brother?" Wang Zhen walked over in surprise.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw the visitor's iconic fat face.</p>

    <p>"Oh... isn't this Zhao Qingxian from the Zhao family?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen recognized the identity of the person at a glance!</p>

    <p>This guy is not staying well in the divine realm. What is he doing on earth...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the bodyguard at the door heard strange noises coming from the toilet and quickly broke in.</p>

    <p>And Wang Zhen had completed the task and walked out from the side as if nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>The package transfer has been completed.</p>

    <p>The person in the toilet now is the fake Jiang Xiaoche. The real person has been knocked unconscious. The Office of Strategic Deception has been teleported by Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? It makes so much noise to tie someone up. Can you do it?" Liu Qingyi was shocked by the scene in front of her. Her face was full of confusion. She didn't know what happened in the toilet just now.</p>

    <p>"I saw Zhao Qingxian!" Wang Zhen whispered.</p>

    <p>"Zhao Qingxian? It's the one from the Zhao family..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi was shocked: "What is he doing on earth!"</p>

    <p>She thought of the terrifying scene when she was chased and intercepted by the Zhao family's young master in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen looked at Liu Qingyi's panicked expression and said with a smile, "Could he be here to find you?"</p>

    <p>"Why are you looking for...looking for me! I can't possibly like her! Even if I like...I can never like him!"</p>

    <p>"Who do you like?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi was silent for a moment. Her face turned red. She quickly changed the subject: "Now, how is he?"</p>

    <p>"Beat him. I think I'll leave him alone."</p>

    <p>"You actually beat him up..." Liu Qingyi laughed instantly.</p>

    <p>It turns out that those strange sounds in the toilet just now were the sounds of Wang Zhen beating someone!</p>

    <p>"If you don't hit him, hit him." Wang Zhenhehehe.</p>

    <p>Even if it's not for Liu Qingyi, it's for himself!</p>

    <p>Among the few people from this divine realm, his status is already the lowest.</p>

    <p>If there were more Zhao Qingxian who liked to flatter Ling Zhenren,</p>

    <p>Wouldn't my status still need to be -1 again??</p>

    <p>Hum!╭(╯^╰)╮!</p>

    <p>He absolutely can't let this happen!</p>
