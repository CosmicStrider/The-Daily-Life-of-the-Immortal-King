  <h1>Chapter 2187 Haven't you noticed?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! The awakening of artificial intelligence. This is not a strange thing. Related concepts have been proposed for a long time.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't expect that Bai Qiao would play a game for the first time. In that ball of game data, the game data actually directly produced a chemical reaction, giving birth to such a person who may be the number one in the modern cultivation world. An artificial intelligence that awakens through self-awareness.</p>

    <p>"So. You decided to transform him directly into reality. Really?" Wang Ying looked at Wang Ling and asked.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he is also gradually carrying out his own plans.</p>

    <p>"Haven't you noticed..."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"No. Nothing. You continue." Wang Ying kept smiling.</p>

    <p>He felt that Wang Ling was a little hopeless. Just because Sun Rong wanted to find Lao Huang, he actually wasted so much effort to resurrect an NPC who had awakened his intelligence into the real world.</p>

    <p>The procedures here are very cumbersome and complicated. The problem of Lao Huang's identity after returning to the real world. This is the best solution to all the problems.</p>

    <p>In addition to solving the identity problem and giving him a name that he can live in in the real world, we also need to solve the problem of Huang's residence and everything that Huang thinks he has in real life in the game world.</p>

    <p>Physical objects such as property are relatively easy to solve. What Wang Ying is thinking about is the connections that Lao Huang thinks he has in the real world... how to deal with this. It is not necessarily for Lao Huang. Create a circle of friends?</p>

    <p>To bring such a virtual character into reality, there are really too many holes to fill. Even if Wang Ling can do it, it won't be a waste of effort.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying just wanted to say is.</p>

    <p>Haven't you noticed that you actually did such a troublesome thing for Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>This matter has been troublesome from beginning to end. And you have always been the most troublesome person.</p>

    <p>But now. You are actually practicing this.</p>

    <p>Although it is said that he likes Lao Huang very much, Wang Ying feels that this conclusion is a bit unreliable.</p>

    <p>The first is the issue of identity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is on the phone to confirm communication with Zhuo Yi. It was originally a very complicated matter. Wang Ling is directly connected to the memory of Zhuo Yi through brain waves. Realized Remote quantum entanglement was discovered. In an instant, Zhuo Yi understood what happened to White Hair.</p>

    <p>"I understand, Master. His name is Huang Shengdong, right? I will go find a colleague to help him settle in." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Creating a false identity is not difficult for Zhuo Yi. Sometimes it is because of the need for tasks. Therefore, his superiors gave him the green light to facilitate his work.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling now comes to him for help, it feels a bit like a public tool for private use. But this man has saved the earth countless times!</p>

    <p>Who knew that his fish-eyed master would give Lao Huang a real-life identity? Is it for the purpose of arranging chess pieces for Bai Zhe's next move?</p>

    <p>After solving the identity problem. Wang Ling next step is to solve Lao Huang's housing problem in the real world.</p>

    <p>This one is actually very simple.</p>

    <p>Just spend some money. It's not a big problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually doesn't have much money. What's left of his pocket money has been deducted by Father Wang, a "skin-splitting writer."</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling can also directly convert his nearly infinite spiritual power into spiritual stones for cash. However, this operation can easily disrupt the cultivation market. Moreover, the places for circulation are also very limited. Nowadays, most occasions use Immortal gold can be traded. Spiritual stones... can probably only be used in places like auctions.</p>

    <p>But the auctions are all about selling ancient secret scrolls, various treasures, spiritual minerals and rare medicinal materials. Real estate like houses are rarely sold directly on the table.</p>

    <p>But if Wang Ling wants, he can own a house at any time.</p>

    <p>After all, the entire Office of Strategic Deception was established and developed to the scale it is today.</p>

    <p>All thanks to him. When needed, just say hello to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The issues of identity and housing have been solved. Wang Ling still has to think about Lao Huang's student status.</p>

    <p>It's all about doing it seamlessly.</p>

    <p>According to Lao Huang's own words, he graduated from Bahuang University majoring in traditional magic weapons. He majored in traditional bows.</p>

    <p>In today's world of cultivation, under the background of modern scientific cultivation, there are actually not many monks who major in traditional bows. Most monks will directly choose to use more lethal weapons. For example, firearms and sniper rifles. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>From the perspective of lethality, sniper rifles are much stronger than traditional bows. This can be verified by Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>But there are still too few monks like Xiang Yi who can conquer the world with a sniper rifle.</p>

    <p>After all, he is in another parallel universe. But he is the protagonist.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is preparing to solve the problem of Bahuang University's student status for Lao Huang. He thinks that if Lao Huang wants to visit his alma mater again, he can't let people not even see his alma mater.</p>

    <p>As a result, he asked Wang Ming to check the system. He found that there was no such school as Bahuang University in the entire Huaxiu country...</p>

    <p>"Yes, Ling Ling. I have already checked. There is no Bahuang University. There is only Bahuang Sect. But that was the sect a thousand years ago. At that time, because of offending the evil master Shen established the Sixiang Sect. The entire sect Uprooted by the evil god."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed and said, "Then what are you going to do now?"</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's view, Wang Ling's various operations today are like telling lies. One lie after another. The more they are filled in, the more they are filled in. It has begun to feel like it is too late to recover.</p>

    <p>"Um..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling. was actually thinking about it.</p>

    <p>Since there is no Bahuang University...</p>

    <p>How about he just open one?</p>
