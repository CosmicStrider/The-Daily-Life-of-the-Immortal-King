  <h1>Chapter 1371 Bai Qiao+Aohai=? ? ?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The thunder tribulation of Tribulation Transcendence and the heavenly tribulation of divine punishment. In the final analysis, they all revolve around the "power of thunder and lightning."</p>

    <p>Thunder. is one of the most terrifying forces in the world.</p>

    <p>The lethality of thunder tribulations and heavenly tribulations will increase tens of millions of times.</p>

    <p>Chaos is the terrifying energy originating from the birth of the universe.</p>

    <p>An anti-world magic weapon. Every 1% of the power of chaos added to it can increase its power by another half percent based on the original value.</p>

    <p>Thunder and Chaos.</p>

    <p>Once the two combine, they form Chaos Thunder.</p>

    <p>The terrifying power cannot be described in words.</p>

    <p>But in front of me, it seems that the most terrifying situation is not the chaos thunder in the sky above the secret realm.</p>

    <p>But a girl who is only in the Foundation Building stage. She is fighting against the Chaos Thunder!</p>

    <p>When the girl drew her sword, her determined look was moving.</p>

    <p>Even though she is only at the Foundation Building stage, her face still shows strong confidence.</p>

    <p>When he drew his sword and struck forward, the seemingly thin figure seemed to burst out with all his strength at this moment. The sword was alluring. It was eye-catching.</p>

    <p>Aohai stood up with a sword energy of tens of thousands of meters. The rolling sword energy of the angry sea roared forward. It demonstrated the depth of the sea and the terrifying power of swallowing all things.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Chaos Thunder and Aohai's sword intent clashed together.</p>

    <p>The two forces collided, causing energy to explode in the sky. Sparks flew everywhere.</p>

    <p>The halos that exploded one after another made the sky in the secret realm seem to be coated with a layer of aurora. There were thousands of rays of light, dazzling and dazzling.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the void. Aohai manifested his body shape.</p>

    <p>She has absorbed the power of tens of thousands of Aohai split bodies split in the sword spirit space.</p>

    <p>This caused Aohai's own size to skyrocket. She appeared in the secret realm like a giant. She stood tall and strong, shaking the sky!</p>

    <p>The beautiful and moving skirt has also been infinitely magnified. When it swings, it exudes a boundless smell of the sea.</p>

    <p>"The water overflows the golden mountain!" Aohai shouted softly. The sound shook the whole country.</p>

    <p>As she spoke, a large piece of scripture immediately appeared in the void, covering the sword energy that hit the sky. Together they suppressed the high-concentration chaos thunder!</p>

    <p>The mouths of the second-generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue never closed from the beginning to the end.</p>

    <p>Moreover, because the concentration of the power of chaos is too strong, they are still in a kneeling position - really kneeling to watch!</p>

    <p>The two forces collided together, wearing down and restricting each other.</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes, the light in the sky dimmed.</p>

    <p>Aohai's blow was quite successful. It offset approximately 15% of the concentration of Chaos Power.</p>

    <p>A large area of chaos was dispersed, causing the concentration in the secret realm to temporarily decrease.</p>

    <p>However, this also used up all Aohai's accumulated strength.</p>

    <p>Such a powerful "Alluring Sword" cannot be used twice in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>Calculated with the same power, the sword fell behind just now. It takes 12 hours of saving before the second strike can be carried out.</p>

    <p>But this kind of savings can be superimposed as long as Sun Rong does not consume it himself.</p>

    <p>Aohai's Sword Spirit Space is a super container. It can be stacked up to 10 times of "Alluring Sword" level.</p>

    <p>"The power is indeed powerful enough." The monk also sighed.</p>

    <p>Aohai's sword did not completely eradicate the power of chaos. This is expected.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is indeed very strong now. But its combat power is still lower than that of the monk.</p>

    <p>Even the monk's palm couldn't eradicate it, let alone Aohai's sword.</p>

    <p>"The sword test is over. Then it's time for us to play." At this time, Bai Qiao said.</p>

    <p>"Understood." The monk nodded: "In a moment, when Miss Bai Qiao merges with Aohai, the poor monk will add the golden Buddha's light to you. Combining all our powers, we will be able to make it foolproof."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bai Qiao...want to merge with Aohai?" Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"This is a special case. This is the only way." Bai Qiao's hair was spinning.</p>

    <p>Then she changed her body shape and turned herself back into the scabbard: "Miss Sun, you're welcome. Feel free to use me!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "What to do?"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao: "Insert Aohai directly into my scabbard. The combination will be completed. Then Miss Sun only needs to do the same as before and strike with the sword again."</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>She followed Bai Qiao's instructions and inserted Aohai into the scabbard of the mahogany sword.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao and Aohai. The two combined!</p>

    <p>In an instant, a powerful force overflowed from Aohai in Sun Rong's hand!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong discovered that the shape of the Aohai in his hand had also changed. The original blue and white sword body turned into a bright orange like an orange!</p>

    <p>At the same time, the newly combined sword spirit officially appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>This is a woman with blue hair and orange eyes who looks extremely elegant.</p>

    <p>Her hair was tied up. Bai Qiao's stupid hair turned into a hairpin and was inserted into her tied up hair.</p>

    <p>A gorgeous snow-white cassock. The long tail at the end drags behind like waves. It hangs like the Milky Way. It is extremely beautiful.</p>

    <p>The woman opened her beautiful phoenix eyes. Her whole body shone like the luster of seabed gems. She had the aura of a queen, just like the ancient genius who made people surrender.</p>

    <p>"My name is Bai Hai." the woman said.</p>

    <p>The sweet voice is like the sound of a conch shell. But it hides an amazing domineering power. There is a sense of ancient times when it is spoken.</p>

    <p>Then, she turned her head and looked at the sky filled with large amounts of chaotic power.</p>

    <p>Bai Hai never made a move. But the monk could already feel the terrifying fighting power emanating from Bai Hai: "As expected of Miss Bai Qiao..."</p>

    <p>He sighed secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>This combination directly increases Aohai's combat power by another order of magnitude based on the original!</p>

    <p>This is an amazing improvement.</p>

    <p>But just to be on the safe side, the monk still opened his "Swastika" without hesitation and applied a layer of golden Buddha's light to Bai Hai's body!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment, Bai Hai's body was coated with a layer of golden light. It was like wearing a layer of golden armor, making the aura emanating from his body even more powerful!</p>

    <p>And because of the blessing of this layer of golden Buddha's light, Sun Rong's Alluring Sword, which originally took 12 hours to accumulate, was instantly recharged by the monk's energy supply.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, the time has come!" At this time, the monk commanded.</p>

    <p>"Yes! Senior!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong responded to the monk's words. She withstood the power of chaos that was almost boiling in the sky. She slashed towards the sky again! Brandishing her Alluring Sword!</p>

    <p>The snow-white sword energy is like waves at this moment. It attacks the sky for the second time!</p>

    <p>The rich power of chaos collided with the white wave sword energy, causing the sword wave to boil. The dense steam surged and rolled with the energy.</p>

    <p>This sword energy is one million meters long!</p>

    <p>It spans the entire secret realm of heaven and earth. Like a watermelon knife, it splits the sky into two in an instant!</p>

    <p>The overwhelming power filled the entire sky. It quickly swallowed up all the power of chaos in the sky at a suffocating speed...</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, the rich power of chaos in the secret realm disappeared. The chaos thunder formed by merging with the thunder calamity also dissipated.</p>

    <p>The blue sky. The warm sunshine falls down. It shines on everyone's face.</p>

    <p>The dissipated pressure was accompanied by the infinite breeze blowing across everyone's cheeks.</p>

    <p>It was a scene that was so tense that I almost collapsed.</p>

    <p>In this moment, the tide of change was strong.</p>

    <p>"Thanks for your hard work."</p>

    <p>Bai Hai turned around and faced Sun Rong with a slight smile.</p>

    <p>Then her body turned into particles of light and dissipated in the thousands of warm suns...</p>
