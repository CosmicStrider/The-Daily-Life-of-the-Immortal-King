  <h1>Chapter 1307 The visitor from the land abandoned by God</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The land abandoned by God. After countless bargainings.</p>

    <p>Now only the head of the Wu family, the head of the Li family and the head of the Sheng family are left.</p>

    <p>"The cultivation of 300 lives..." The head of the Wu family wanted to cry but had no tears.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because God's Spirit Column doesn't like him.</p>

    <p>The price of his resurrection has been forced to be increased to 300 lives...</p>

    <p>The head of the Wu family felt a little broken inside. The cost of 300 lives. This is no different from directly choosing to be reincarnated.</p>

    <p>But the head of the Wu family didn't dare to ask or tell. Because of the Spirit Column's temper, he might be punished for another 30 years if he asked.</p>

    <p>"I think I'd better just die." The head of the Wu family gave up resistance. He sat slumped on the ground, regretting it endlessly.</p>

    <p>If he had known this, he might as well have accepted the punishment of the first 100 lives earlier. Otherwise, he wouldn't have reached this point.</p>

    <p>"I think we can still save a little more." The head of the Li family sweated on his temples.</p>

    <p>His punishment results are not much better than those of the head of the Wu family. The more punishments he gets, the more punishments he gets. They have been piled up to 200 lifetimes.</p>

    <p>The head of the Sheng family was even worse. Because he was the mastermind who instigated the war, he was directly sentenced to 500 lives.</p>

    <p>In other words, the three of them together must pay 1,000 lifetimes of cultivation... before they can get out of this god-forsaken place!</p>

    <p>In short, no matter whether he can go out or not...the head of the Sheng family will have the word "miserable" written on his forehead.</p>

    <p>"There must be other ways!" The head of the Li family gritted his teeth. He still refused to give up.</p>

    <p>He prayed devoutly, hoping that someone would come down from the sky to save them.</p>

    <p>The three family heads know very well that if they choose to be reincarnated.</p>

    <p>The Wu, Li, and Sheng families will quickly fall apart in a very short period of time without Dao God in charge.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the three family heads are in distress."</p>

    <p>In the land abandoned by the gods, a disembodied voice came.</p>

    <p>The direction of this sound could not be determined. It seemed as if it was coming from an extremely long distance. It also seemed as if it was very close at hand.</p>

    <p>Immediately, the owner of the voice appeared. They only saw a faint outline that was definitely not a human figure.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>The heads of the three families were shocked. They simply could not believe that they could see other living beings in this god-forsaken land.</p>

    <p>And they can be sure that this creature is definitely not a substance like a dead soul. It is essentially different from them.</p>

    <p>This mysterious creature was shrouded in a thick gray mist. It exuded a divine aura. There was a sense of mystery all over its body.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know the origin of this gray mist creature, just based on intuition, the head of the Li family felt that maybe they could be saved!</p>

    <p>"I dare to ask, your Excellency, can you save me? It's like fire or water?" The head of the Li family showed longing eyes.</p>

    <p>"It's easy to save you."</p>

    <p>The gray mist creature laughed: "I can resurrect you without spending a single bit of cultivation."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the pillar spirit in the land abandoned by the gods finally couldn't help but speak out.</p>

    <p>"Shut up...you shouldn't be here..."</p>

    <p>The Pillar of God's Abandonment trembled slightly, seeming to be very angry at the appearance of the gray mist creatures.</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>The entire land abandoned by the gods began to riot. The originally peaceful space began to tremble violently. Countless black lotuses condensed with powerful spiritual energy bloomed from the cracked earth.</p>

    <p>These black lotuses are amazingly powerful. They exude incredible divine power. The three heads of the Wu, Li, and Sheng families are surrounded by these black lotuses.</p>

    <p>At the same time, countless vines sprouted from the cracks in the ground and wrapped around their feet.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of the three of them, these blossoming black lotuses were like mines. The power contained in just one of them was enough to destroy their souls.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, the mysterious creature in the gray mist spoke again.</p>

    <p>He was in a place abandoned by gods, but he didn't take Zhu Ling into his eyes at all.</p>

    <p>"I advise you to stop...you know. Exploding these black lotuses won't do anyone any good," the gray mist creature said.</p>

    <p>This is definitely not a tone of discussion. It is an unquestionable tone of command.</p>

    <p>For a long time, God Spirit Column did not speak.</p>

    <p>It is obviously afraid of the creatures in the gray mist. However, it also knows that this is a place abandoned by gods!</p>

    <p>This is not the first time that this gray mist creature has challenged the authority of its pillar spirit.</p>

    <p>So this time, Zhu Ling didn't plan to endure it any longer.</p>

    <p>"Then let's die together."</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling's voice was cold.</p>

    <p>Decided to fight head-on with the creatures in the gray mist.</p>

    <p>It controls the black lotus on the ground. The black lotus bursts into blazing light on the spot!</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the souls of the three masters are trembling!</p>

    <p>They have no doubt that these black lotuses will explode in the next second, completely destroying their souls!</p>

    <p>However, what they didn't expect was that the power of this gray mist creature was far beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>This was a duel beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>The three masters can't help but start to wonder whether there are other realms between Dao God and Dao Ancestor...</p>

    <p>Whether it is the power of pillar spirits or the power of gray mist creatures, it is far beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>"Finally, can't you bear it anymore...want to detonate the black lotus? How can I let you succeed..." The creature in the gray mist let out a gentle laugh.</p>

    <p>He seemed to have expected such a result.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the layer of mysterious gray fog lingering around the creatures in the gray fog suddenly spread out, overwhelming the sky and covering the entire land abandoned by the gods!</p>

    <p>These gray mist are like gluttonous minions, swallowing up the black lotus on the ground and the accompanying black vines!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the terrifying black lotus spawned by the pillar spirit's rage had no time to complete the explosion and disappeared instantly.</p>

    <p>"You are just something inspired by Dao Ancestor. You cannot be my opponent..."</p>

    <p>The next moment, the overwhelming gray fog in the God-Abandoned Land condensed again.</p>

    <p>The outline of the gray mist creature also appeared beside the Pillar of God's Abandonment. He stretched out his claws and pressed on the Pillar of God's Abandonment.</p>

    <p>It's obviously a caress, but it's actually a threat.</p>

    <p>"You rely on your authority to do whatever you want. You will eventually get backlash..." God Spirit Column was helpless.</p>

    <p>It never expected that it would encounter such a rogue and annoying guy! Overstepping one's authority, Repeatedly meddling in the affairs of its god-forsaken land!</p>

    <p>"Life is so boring. You have to find something interesting to do, right?"</p>

    <p>The creature in the gray mist loosened its claws and laughed again: "I'm kidding you. I don't really want to kill you. Dao Ancestor doesn't have many enlightenment toys left. I have to keep you to make it interesting."</p>

    <p>"What on earth do you want to do..." God Spirit Column still doesn't quite understand why the gray mist creatures are willing to rescue the heads of these three families.</p>

    <p>"What don't you want to do?"</p>

    <p>The gray mist creature spread its paws. He looked at the heads of the three families in front of him: "I just think their greed is very interesting. How about you give me some face?"</p>

    <p>"What are you doing..." God Spirit Column said almost through gritted teeth.</p>

    <p>It wanted to say: "You are seeking death."</p>

    <p>But once the words came to my lips, I was too lazy to continue talking.</p>

    <p>Because it knew that it was impossible to make sense between itself and the creatures in the gray mist.</p>

    <p>"Take the three of them. Get out!"</p>

    <p>These are the last words God Spirit Column said to this gray mist creature.</p>

    <p>"It's just a toy that has been enlightened. It has quite a bad temper." The gray mist creature chuckled.</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>He opened the gray mist and swept away the souls of the three family heads. They disappeared together into this god-forsaken place...</p>
