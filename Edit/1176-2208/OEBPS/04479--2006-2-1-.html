  <h1>Chapter 2006 2 in 1. Office of Strategic Deception training daily life</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling thought about it carefully in the car. The last time I took a school exclusive bus like this with a group of people I was familiar with was...</p>

    <p>Uh... that time was actually when we held a spirit sword exchange meeting with Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, this semester has expired.</p>

    <p>The Immortal King has been serialized for four years. The animation has already aired its second season. And the third season will be announced soon. The original work is still a single guy. In the extra story, the children are almost spoiled. In the main film, even high school students Didn't graduate.</p>

    <p>So on the Office of Strategic Deception bus leading to the Office of Strategic Deception headquarters. Wang Ling temporarily closed his eyes gently. Fortunately, he has adapted to this rhythm of life. Anyway, judging from the current progress. Unless the handwriting speed of this stupid original can reach the level of tens of thousands of words a day. Otherwise, I am afraid it will be a long time before he "retires."</p>

    <p>At noon, they arrived at the Office of Strategic Deception headquarters on time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling last came to the Office of Strategic Deception. I can't remember when it was.</p>

    <p>Today, the construction of the Office of Strategic Deception has begun to take shape. As the largest sect in the world today, the magnanimity of the main entrance of the Office of Strategic Deception is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>The towering cloud building seems to reach straight into the sky. There are two huge words "Office of Strategic Deception" engraved on it in ancient language. It is only close to the mountain gate. The astonishing aura inside the entire Office of Strategic Deception has already hit your face.</p>

    <p>Only Chen Chao and Guo Hao were left in the audience. They looked like children who had just arrived from the village and had never seen much of the world. They opened their mouths and kept saying wows.</p>

    <p>It's not like they haven't been to the Office of Strategic Deception. After all, they just went to the Office of Strategic Deception Internet cafe not long ago. However, that time it was Sun Rong who brought them in with a teleportation charm. It was also in the Office of Strategic Deception Internet cafe. I wandered around for a while. And in the end, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to get a feel for the overall appearance of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Now that I can see it with my own eyes, the shocking feeling is almost vivid.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the Office of Strategic Deception is worthy of being the largest sect in the world. It is surrounded by mountains. Every immortal peak is covered with a giant spiritual gathering array. Together with the high-quality underground spiritual veins of the Office of Strategic Deception, you don't even have to go there. What secret realm of cultivation? The entire Office of Strategic Deception sect is an excellent holy land for cultivation.</p>

    <p>Of course. As a modern sect, the training venue of the Office of Strategic Deception is also very luxurious. Now it is backed by the major shareholder Huaxiu Alliance. All the magic circles and equipment are constantly updated with the advancement of modern cultivation technology.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling feels strange every time I come here. I feel that the Office of Strategic Deception has become more majestic and grander than before.</p>

    <p>This is a secret training. So when Zhuo Yi's exclusive bus arrived at the gate of the Office of Strategic Deception, the disciples guarding here had already been transferred. Instead, mechanical levitation eyes for reconnaissance and defense were used. To protect.</p>

    <p>This is what Zhuo Yi mentioned to Keorn specifically for safety reasons. After all, people talk a lot. Nothing is more reliable than a robot. At that time, they only need to delete the entry and exit records of this training session from the eyes of the machine. That is It's something that God doesn't know and ghosts don't know.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi positioned the bus and drove slowly along the pre-booked main road. There were no Office of Strategic Deception disciples on the road. The incoming roads were all cleared like the entrance to the mountain.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao opened the car windows. Along the mountain road, they could clearly see the majestic True Venerated Immortal hall surrounding the pioneers.</p>

    <p>"That's Lord Diulei's True Venerated Immortal Hall..." Chen Chao opened his mouth. His face was full of surprise and admiration. He had only seen it in the news before. He didn't expect that the real building is far better than the video image. What was captured here is even more shocking.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the main square in front of the True Venerated Immortal Hall, many disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception gathered here. These are the inner disciples of the elite of the Office of Strategic Deception. All of them possess the lowest level of the Nascent Soul stage.</p>

    <p>At this time, under the scorching sun, everyone gathered here to sit cross-legged and breathe out. Under the scorching sun, their clothes were fluttering. Their expressions were peaceful. No one moved their body, and there was not a trace of sweat on their cheeks. fall.</p>

    <p>Everyone seems to be completely in trance and is breathing out spiritual energy week after week.</p>

    <p>Exercise your mind every day. It is almost a compulsory course for these inner disciples of Nascent Soul.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of Nascent Souls were meditating at the same time. This scene was really shocking. Only the Office of Strategic Deception could see this scene.</p>

    <p>The key is. These hundreds of inner disciples at the Nascent Soul stage are just a small department of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Today, the Office of Strategic Deception has many disciples. True disciples are not rare. The total number of internal and external disciples recruited alone is twenty to thirty thousand.</p>

    <p>And all of them are carefully selected elites. They are talented people who are selected from the best.</p>

    <p>They practice hard in the Office of Strategic Deception. If they succeed in their studies and then leave the Office of Strategic Deception, they will become very outstanding teachers in the cultivation world. They will be popular wherever they go.</p>

    <p>Being a disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception is no different from gold plating to people in the current world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it is because the Office of Strategic Deception is bound to the Huaxiu Alliance. The experience of practicing cultivation after entering the Office of Strategic Deception has actually become an important consideration criterion for civil servants in the education industry in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>For people who have high self-esteem, if they are just outer disciples, that is still far from enough.</p>

    <p>Someone on the Internet previously compiled a gold-plated comparison table.</p>

    <p>Outer disciples who have graduated from the Office of Strategic Deception. You can choose from junior high schools and high schools in Huaxiu. Once you join the job, you will become a gold medal teacher.</p>

    <p>Inner disciples who have graduated from the Office of Strategic Deception can choose from any high school in Huaxiu and apply for the position of dean.</p>

    <p>As for true disciples from the Office of Strategic Deception, in addition to the above two-level job application requirements, you can also consider becoming a university teacher. You will immediately enjoy the standard of S-level gold medal lecturer after entering the school. If you can complete an article during your employment period Cultivation academic papers rated A-level or above can also directly obtain the professional title of associate professor.</p>

    <p>As for the more rare level of office of strategic deception, you can even directly run for the position of dean and vice president of a university.</p>

    <p>So why are so many people trying to get into the Office of Strategic Deception?</p>

    <p>In fact, I still want to gild my future status as a civil servant.</p>

    <p>The bus continued to drive forward. Zhuo Yi deliberately slowed down the bus. It also wanted to introduce the Office of Strategic Deception to the two students on the bus who did not know much about the Office of Strategic Deception before arriving at the entrance to the Mountain of Retrospection. Daily practice of Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>When passing by an eggshell-shaped glass training hall, Zhuo Yi pressed a button. The small TV embedded on the top of the bus was immediately put down. The scene in the training hall was simultaneously played: "This eggshell-shaped glass training hall The Glass Training Hall. It's the Office of Strategic Deception's spell-throwing training hall."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao then saw that all the Office of Strategic Deception disciples in the training hall were wearing thick goggles and performing spell-throwing movements in a uniform manner.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior. These glasses are not ordinary goggles, right?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"Xuedi Chen is right. These are combat training goggles specially used for spell throwing. This goggle can simulate the spiritual power of the wearer, thus forming a virtual spell effect. Combined with the target in front, it can complete daily tasks. Spell throwing training."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi explained: "In fact, it is the same as playing a virtual game. In this way, it can also serve the purpose of training the accuracy of throwing spells. And there is no need to worry about excessive spiritual power loss. The most important thing is. No There will be damage to buildings and contamination issues caused by smoke from spell explosions."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Chen Chao and Guo Hao nodded. They have gained a lot of experience. After all, they are super sects. These training methods are completely different. They are full of the high-tech sense of cultivation technology.</p>

    <p>They sighed with emotion all the way, admiring the beautiful scenery of the sect along the Office of Strategic Deception and watching Zhuo Yi play the synchronized training scenes inside each combat training hall on the small TV.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Chen Chao and Guo Hao felt like country people. It felt like they were seeing high-end cultivation technology for the first time.</p>

    <p>You must know that the Songhai City where they live has long been home to cultivation technology. It is known as the metropolis with the most modern technology!</p>

    <p>Now when they came to the Office of Strategic Deception, the two of them immediately felt the importance of learning. It was because their knowledge was not broad enough. That's why they screamed after seeing these things... I really want to talk about it. The two of them even felt a little bit embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"That's not right. Why do I suddenly feel that we are the only ones who have never seen the world... How can you be so calm and composed? Have you been to the Office of Strategic Deception before?" Suddenly Guo Hao reacted. Somewhat. He looked at the people in the car strangely.</p>

    <p>Until now, Chen Chao and Guo Hao have not realized that the classmates sitting in the car at this moment all hold important positions in the Office of Strategic Deception. Except for Jiugong Liangzi, almost everyone in the car is an Office of Strategic Deception. Core members.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao's words woke up everyone immediately. Sun Rong said with a smile without losing embarrassment: "This is the first time for everyone to see such a powerful sect facility. So we were all stunned? Actually, I have been wanting to ask Senior Zhuo a question just now. Where can I buy peripheral products of Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong is a good question." Zhuo Yi nodded. He knew that Sun Rong was deliberately helping to change the subject. He quickly added: "As we all know, the Office of Strategic Deception is the most The famous peripheral product is Heavenly Dao broccoli produced by Office of Strategic Deception! Heavenly Dao broccoli is hard to find in the market now! But everyone is in luck today!"</p>

    <p>Saying that, Zhuo Yi quickly switched the channel on the small TV. It switched to the internal live broadcast on the Office of Strategic Deception TV Tower: "As you can see, this live broadcast room is an internal employee live broadcast room! Everything for sale is It is an exclusive benefit for employees! Today, the master of the Office of Strategic Deception knew that everyone was coming, so he specially prepared a program! Heavenly Dao broccoli for employees priced at 9,999 yuan per piece! You can enjoy it in this live broadcast room today Buy it!"</p>

    <p>"Is this too expensive?" Jiugong Liangzi asked very cooperatively.</p>

    <p>"This is already an employee price that is 50% cheaper than the market price! But it doesn't matter. Since Jiugong said so, I will definitely get the best price for everyone! Let me see it this way...ten yuan a piece!"</p>

    <p>"Ten yuan!" Jiugong Liangzi exclaimed: "Boss, you will lose money if you do this!"</p>

    <p>"No matter. Today I want to sell it to my dearest juniors and juniors for ten yuan! Come on! I will upload the link now!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This little episode directly enlivened the atmosphere in the car a lot.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao really made money this time. They scanned the code excitedly. Each of them bought ten pieces of Heavenly Dao broccoli for 100 yuan.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling also noticed that Chen Chao seemed to be looking at him intentionally or unintentionally during the scanning process.</p>

    <p>"Hey. You said Wang Ling. Apart from dry noodles that can excite him...what else can excite him?" Chen Chao stared at Wang Ling's usual calm expression and smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"He hasn't always been like this. He only has a few lines. I thought you were used to it."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Chen Chao nodded. He clicked his cell phone and said, "Just seeing your child being so calm, I had a bold idea for a moment."</p>

    <p>"What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"His calmness gives me a feeling...as if he runs the Office of Strategic Deception. He is the boss behind the scenes."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Inside Qu Shuling's student apartment.</p>

    <p>He has been locked in the student apartment for three full days.</p>

    <p>But the one on his hand didn't have dragon scales. He was still debating whether to swallow it or not.</p>

    <p>At this time, after being immersed in it for a long time, Qu Shuling heard the commotion of several spirit guards at the door. Qu Shuling realized that it must be his teacher Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>Although he had sensed that Dai Tianchun was coming, Qu Shuling didn't know why he felt that Dai Tianchun today seemed a little different from the teacher he knew in the past.</p>

    <p>Even during this visit, the spiritual guards at the door no longer felt as nervous as when they first met Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was locked up in the apartment. He had no idea what was happening outside, let alone what happened to Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, he clearly heard the laughter of his teacher Dai Tianchun and the group of spiritual guards at the door...</p>

    <p>This laughter made Qu Shuling's cheeks shed a drop of cold sweat.</p>

    <p>My own teacher. What happened?</p>

    <p>When Dai Tianchun came in successfully carrying the lunch box, Qu Shuling was even more horrified when he saw Dai Tianchun. Because he found that his teacher had not only shaved his hair into a crew cut, but also the mighty lion beard from before. Smoothed out.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what are you doing..." Qu Shuling stood up on the spot and stared at Dai Tianchun's new look. His eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Let's eat first." Dai Tianchun chuckled and put down the lunch box as before: "Humans always have to experience new looks. I have had my hair style and beard style for thousands of years. After shaving, Everyone says I have become much more energetic."</p>

    <p>"Indeed... very energetic..." Qu Shuling was speechless. He didn't know what to say to describe his mood at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Really? That's good. I'm just afraid that you might not be used to reading Shu Ling." Dai Tianchun said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"But it's really a bit surprising."</p>

    <p>As Qu Shuling spoke, he opened the lunch box and began to look at each dish inside carefully.</p>

    <p>He stirred each dish with his chopsticks, as if he was searching for something in it.</p>

    <p>"This time I came, I just brought you some food. There is nothing else in it. You don't have to look for it." Dai Tianchun said.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what happened?" Qu Shuling was confused.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. I came here to tell you that our place in the Shengke University has been saved. Although only Xiaosu went there, I think it's enough." Dai Tianchun said, "In addition, I also have a relationship with the Jingmi Institute. We have reached a settlement agreement that will allow you to leave the confinement of the apartment. In addition, Jingmi Institute will also suspend the investigation against you."</p>

    <p>"Then...what's the price?" Qu Shuling's expression darkened.</p>

    <p>"The price is that you must go abroad to participate in the peacekeeping mission of the International United Cultivators Association for a period of one year." Dai Tianchun said, looking at Qu Shuling's face full of disbelief.</p>
