  <h1>Chapter 2185 Professional light bulb replacement plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! Friday, January 24th.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu lived up to expectations and completed his mission. With the help of Wang Ling, he successfully completed this Wall Breaker operation.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe's tentative actions failed. But this does not mean that the other party will stop there. For Wang Ling, he needs to protect the entire earth in secret. But in Bai Zhe's eyes, he has already taken Wang Ling As his fateful opponent.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe arranged this piece of gray fog that can be converted into reality and reality. Wang Ling secretly collected part of it with his own divine weapon. He planned to use it for research.</p>

    <p>This is a piece of intelligent gray fog. Wang Ling connected Wang Tong to the game cabin in the form of a data cable. Then they cast a spell on the gray fog to convert reality into reality, making the gray fog mistakenly think that Wang Tong was theirs. Home. As a result, part of the gray fog was successfully captured by Wang Tong.</p>

    <p>So far, Wang Ling still has not found out the source of this strange gray mist. Wang Tong also has a method of converting virtual reality into reality. In a sense, gray mist's method of converting virtual reality into reality is very similar to Wang Tong's. But not as strong as Wang Tong.</p>

    <p>If it is really enough to compete with Wang Tong, it won't be partially captured by Wang Tong.</p>

    <p>On that day, almost all the players who were trapped in the game cabin woke up and left the game cabin. It was as if they had had a dream. All the monks didn't understand what happened. They just felt that the Itinerant Immortal magic ring was The game is so magical...it has a magical power that makes people immersed in it. I spent several days without even realizing it.</p>

    <p>It is indeed the immersive game of the year!</p>

    <p>Many players didn't realize it. They didn't know that they were protected by Wang Ling. They escaped a catastrophe that almost meant they would become virtual characters forever. Instead, they happily played the ultimate Itinerant Immortal ring one after another. High overall game score.</p>

    <p>At the same time, because the game is too immersive, Bai Qiao also received a notice of server suspension and rectification from Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>This once again pushed the Itinerant Immortal magic ring to a climax. Many monks who had never played this game began to feel regretful. It was a pity that they did not experience this game earlier...</p>

    <p>It is actually necessary to stop taking it for rectification.</p>

    <p>This is also what Wang Ling means.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling cracked the gray fog and prevented a large number of players from this unnecessary disaster. But it is not sure whether Bai Zhe will leave any other easter eggs in the game world of Itinerant Immortal. So he I asked Bai Qiao to stop the server immediately. I cooperated with Wang Ming to investigate the program loopholes in the game in detail to ensure that Bai Zhe did not leave any trouble.</p>

    <p>After exiting the game, Sun Rong felt a little empty in his mind.</p>

    <p>Finally, I played a game with Wang Ling. After quitting the game, the girl began to feel a little... No! It was a lot. A hollow feeling...</p>

    <p>Playing games with a boy for so long. To be honest, this is the first time Sun Rong has done that.</p>

    <p>If it had been anyone else, one more minute would have been too long for her. That is, Wang Ling...it would have given her unprecedented patience for the rest of her life.</p>

    <p>Of course. The root cause is that she is greedy for him...</p>

    <p>I've been craving it for a long time.</p>

    <p>In the game world, there seemed to be endless tasks between her and Wang Ling, which could bring them closer. But after leaving those tasks in the game, Sun Rong suddenly found herself temporarily I couldn't find any other reason to date Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>According to Sun Rong's inherent routine. In order to prevent herself from being too embarrassed when she is alone with Wang Ling, she usually invites Chen Chao and Guo Hao, two professional light bulbs, to go out to play support. However, she doesn't In addition, give Chen Chao and Guo Hao some benefits. Let them find a chance to escape halfway... This will naturally create conditions for getting along with Wang Ling naturally.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Now Chen Chao and Guo Hao are still practicing under the leadership of their master for the plan to impact the center of the earth...</p>

    <p>Yes. She has been playing the game for several days. But Chen Chao and Guo Hao still haven't come out of the secret realm of adaptation in Hui Shuo Mountain.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er... you said. Is there any other way..." Sun Rong fell into distress.</p>

    <p>Even this started to give advice to Sun Ying'er who looked very unreliable. Sun Ying'er held her waist. In the past few days of Sun Rong and Wang Ling's happy game. She She was actually tortured quite a lot by Wang Ying. But because of memory synchronization, she knew more or less everything that happened in the game world with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Ying'er's comments, Sun Rong originally didn't have much hope.</p>

    <p>But this time, Sun Ying'er actually made a constructive suggestion: "Now the game is out of service. But didn't you make new friends in the game? You can go and get that with Ling Zhenren. Make an appointment with your new friend. Temporarily take the place of Chen Chao and Guo Hao, the two professional light bulbs."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong tapped his hand: "Yes!"</p>

    <p>She remembered it instantly. Old Huang...</p>

    <p>During these days in Fuyun Town, I was inseparable from them. I followed the passerby players who dealt with large and small matters together. Not only were they humorous and funny, but the key was that they also had high emotional intelligence!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong actually has a hunch. This person must be a good assist!</p>

    <p>"Yes, Ying'er. I didn't expect you to actually come up with a good idea!" Sun Rong was moved by Sun Ying'er's enlightenment.</p>

    <p>The next step is to find Lao Huang!</p>

    <p>In terms of player information, Sun Rong cannot investigate by himself. He can only ask Bai Qiao... But Bai Qiao is the scabbard spirit of Wang Ling after all. Sun Rong is worried that he will go there directly. Asking will alert the snake. In the end, I used a roundabout way to find another reliable person who knew the entire game structure and would never betray himself to help.</p>

    <p>"Yes...Brother Ming. This is the player named Lao Huang..."Sun Rong called Wang Ming directly and asked cautiously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had actually known that Sun Rong would make such a call. He immediately laughed and said, "Don't worry. The matter between you and Wang Ling is my business. Checking a person's information is nothing. But this I'm busy. I can only help you once... After all, it's very unethical to check someone's home address..."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Brother Ming... don't worry. If Lao Huang refuses to meet us, I will never force him..." Sun Rong nodded quickly and said, "I will send a message to ask first."</p>

    <p>"What did he tell you when we were in the game before?"</p>

    <p>"He said he also lives in Songhai. His profession is a painting repairman."</p>

    <p>"Painting repair?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised his eyebrows: "Did you major in immortal painting in college? This major is very unpopular. Although Ma Liang, the magic brush, is very handsome, most of the spells in it are difficult to control."</p>

    <p>"Yes. So I think Lao Huang is also a very powerful person in the real world." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at the computer screen and operated.</p>

    <p>About three minutes later, Wang Ming's suspicious voice came over the phone: "That's not right, Rongrong. Are you sure the game ID you provided is correct?"</p>

    <p>"There's no mistake...Lao Huang's game ID. I know it by heart. This is it."</p>

    <p>"But it's strange. I didn't find any information about this ID in the player database."</p>
