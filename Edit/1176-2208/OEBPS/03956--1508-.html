  <h1>Chapter 1508 Maintenance of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The autistic girl who was regarded as a "potential" ghost by Jiugong Xinghui and the demons.</p>

    <p>He is a current student at Jiudaohe High School. Noko Ohira.</p>

    <p>The area of Sun Island is not too big. But if you want to assemble your own "hundred thousand evil soldiers" on the island to capture ghosts just by ordinary methods, it will definitely not work.</p>

    <p>So after Jiugong Xinghui cooperated with the devil.</p>

    <p>I will also identify many "potential stocks" among human beings like this.</p>

    <p>Many people may be forced by the environment, or may be due to family or work reasons...</p>

    <p>After being deprived of care, suffering rejection and all kinds of mental violence, they gradually formed an "antisocial personality" in their hearts.</p>

    <p>And this kind of personality is exactly what Jiugong Xinghui and the devil need.</p>

    <p>Because human beings with this type of personality are often more likely to go dark.</p>

    <p>And because of his own strong resentment, he formed a strong "revenge mentality" after his death.</p>

    <p>However, there are various factors that can cause ghosts to form. It does not mean that a person with strong resentment will definitely become a ghost.</p>

    <p>Strong resentment will only cause the soul to stay in the world for a while after death.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirit took a fancy to this and formulated the plan of "artificial ghost."</p>

    <p>They also have this ability.</p>

    <p>Turn these "chosen children" into the ghosts they want.</p>

    <p>And then be driven by them.</p>

    <p>As for the transformation methods, there are two ways.</p>

    <p>One is to wait for these "potential stocks" to die and then harvest them.</p>

    <p>And the other way is to forcibly turn them into ghosts while they are still in human form.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the intensity of the ghosts formed by taking the second coercive measure is actually not as strong as the first.</p>

    <p>But now. To test Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui felt it was necessary to do that.</p>

    <p>Her "potential stocks" that are being cultivated are spread throughout the Sun Island.</p>

    <p>It's not just Noko Ohira.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready?" At this time, Jiugong Xinghui closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Everything is ready."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Get upper body."</p>

    <p>After skillfully switching his body, Jiugong Xinghui returned control of his body to the demon spirit.</p>

    <p>With the mysterious eyes gradually turning pink.</p>

    <p>In Jiugong Xinghui's braided hair, there is a hair that seems to be given vitality. It flies towards the sky...</p>

    <p>Forced ghost.</p>

    <p>You can also take advantage of the super long range of the monster to achieve remote operation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, December 15th at 10am.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling group officially enrolled in Class S of Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>This is the class system within Jiudaohe High School. It is similar to the operating model of Number 60 High School's ordinary classes and elite classes. It is also called the top class class.</p>

    <p>The characteristic is that the number of students is small, but the quality of the students is very high. Even the teachers are specially hired.</p>

    <p>Except for these few students in Class S, I will not devote my time to teaching other classes.</p>

    <p>This is different from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>For example, Teacher Pan. Although she is the teacher of the elite class, she also teaches children in other classes.</p>

    <p>The essence of class grading is to better integrate students at all stages.</p>

    <p>Rather than seeking special treatment or differentiation.</p>

    <p>Students of the same level take classes and take exams together. The pressure will not be too great.</p>

    <p>In a relaxed environment, students can absorb knowledge better.</p>

    <p>What Jiudaohe High School does is like giving preferential treatment to a group of aristocratic students...</p>

    <p>Although there were few people, Wang Ling still felt a sense of discomfort.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found out. I don't know when. He started to get used to the teaching at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is actually the recognition of Principal Chen's educational philosophy.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, a "strength-oriented classroom grading system" like Jiudaohe's is not desirable... and such an environment is also the most prone to school violence.</p>

    <p>In order to allow new students to adapt to the school environment as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>After Jin Deng's communication, Jiudaohe arranged the seating position for Wang Ling. It is the same as Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The second to last row by the window.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened with some boredom to the lecture on the cultivation course of Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>This class is about the topic of "spiritual power output."</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, this is by no means new knowledge.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if Jiudaohe arranged this course on purpose. During this class session, everyone was given an energy ball with a numerical test of spiritual power output.</p>

    <p>Including Wang Ling and others. A total of fifteen students.</p>

    <p>When the energy ball is sent to everyone's hands.</p>

    <p>The local Jiudaohe students in the class almost immediately turned their attention to the three people Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. I heard that you are all outstanding students at Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>Sitting in the front seat of Wang Ling is a student with an elite look on his face. He is thin and always likes to poke his glasses frames with his middle finger. He is looking back at Wang Ling, with the corners of his lips raised slightly.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a suit specially made by Jiudaohe. He had an air of nobility all over his body.</p>

    <p>Compare it to Number 60 High School's blue sportswear with the word "Jing" written on it. It seems particularly gorgeous.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of Wang Ling, the boy in front of him is like a gorgeous and noble Kongque. He has an arrogant attitude.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully held the energy ball. The thing was like a hot potato in his hand. Wang Ling was a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>If this happens accidentally and it explodes, I'm afraid I'll have to pay for it, right?</p>

    <p>He also wants to leave funds for Ah Nuan to buy gifts...</p>

    <p>But if you don't pay attention and increase the output, I'm afraid it will explode on the spot...</p>

    <p>And this energy ball is made of a special crystal.</p>

    <p>If it explodes here, the flying crystal slag will hurt innocent people...</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling stared at the energy ball in his hand. He was struggling in his heart.</p>

    <p>As a result, the Kongque man in front of me smiled again and said, "Houlang Sang. You look nervous?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Don't be so nervous. When you come here, it's just like coming to your own home. Oh, by the way. I forgot. After talking for so long, do you not understand our native language at all?" Kongque said. It seems to be comforting. In fact, it is sarcastic.</p>

    <p>We are preparing to switch to Mandarin mode to communicate with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the edge. Sun Rong couldn't stand it anymore: "I didn't expect that the local education in Sun Island is of such a standard. It's really disappointing."</p>

    <p>Very standard Sun Island language.</p>

    <p>It immediately attracted the attention of everyone in Class S.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Kongque refused. He was shocked by Sun Rong's fluent Mandarin.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling... oh no. It's Houlang Sang. His strength is actually always above mine." Sun Rong continued.</p>

    <p>"But I heard that Houlang Sang is just the mascot in your school."</p>

    <p>The Kongque man spread his hands. He looked at Sun Rong and smiled and said, "You have to know that anyone in Class S has the ability to crush this energy ball in front of you with their own spiritual energy."</p>

    <p>"Really?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was smiling. But his smile was hiding a hidden meaning: "Then... I can do it alone..."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she stretched out her hand and gently tapped the energy ball in front of the table.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A blue ripple spread from her fingertips.</p>

    <p>Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang...</p>

    <p>A series of sounds of glass exploding were heard from Class S.</p>

    <p>The local students at Jiudaohe High School were all stunned.</p>

    <p>They never expected that the girl was so powerful. She shattered all the energy balls with just her own strength!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming folded his arms and watched the show alone.</p>

    <p>He was actually a little touched.</p>

    <p>There are not many girls these days who can be so considerate of others...</p>

    <p>...</p>
