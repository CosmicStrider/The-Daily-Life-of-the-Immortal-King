  <h1>Chapter 1208 Me. Sun Rong. Stud!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment Yi Zhiyang launched the Sun Rong side, the hearts of those who supported Sun Rong inside and outside the court went cold. Many principals rubbed their eyes, convinced that they had seen it right.</p>

    <p>The Sword Master's Wuji Sword was actually learned by a boy who was in the Foundation Building period... No wonder he became General Yi's adopted son. Such talent in swordsmanship is truly rare in the world!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong is probably going to lose." Several principals looked at the scene in front of them. They suddenly felt that the overall situation was decided.</p>

    <p>{Wuji Sword} is a method that can infinitely activate the unlimited potential of swordsmen. Although Yi Zhiyang has only mastered it at the beginning, it is still scary.</p>

    <p>The surging sword energy and aura that surged all over his body were as powerful as Mount Tai. When it burst out at this moment, the protective golden talismans of several people in the field were suddenly triggered.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, who was already injured, was affected and was eliminated directly.</p>

    <p>On the other side, the girl pair Yan Xiaochun and Li Youyue were even more miserable. They had clearly kept a distance from the battlefield. They were still affected by the impact and were forced to trigger the golden talisman.</p>

    <p>Why is this happening...</p>

    <p>Seeing that all his remaining junior sisters were eliminated, Zhu Hanyun almost fainted on the spot.</p>

    <p>When the Wuji Sword is blessed, the power of the resonance of the sword will be further increased.</p>

    <p>In other words, at this moment, the sword energy around Yi Zhiyang also increased significantly. The sword barrier that was originally only a few feet expanded to several feet away. An indiscriminate range attack was realized on the spot!</p>

    <p>But fortunately Sun Rong reacted quickly. She sacrificed three clone swords again to protect the three boys closest to her. Only Li Youyue was not saved. The reason was that Li Youyue hid too far away. She didn't have time to rely on the sacrificial sword for protection.</p>

    <p>As for Nan Yixiu and Tang Jingze, these two reacted quickly and were very smart. When they saw something was wrong, they immediately used their homemade {Levitating Talisman} to save their lives.</p>

    <p>The fluctuations of the sword energy are certainly terrifying, but they affect the ground after all. As long as you keep a certain distance at high altitude, you can avoid the impact of this shock wave.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu still remembers his duel with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's just a floating symbol. Just use it. When the time comes, as long as you win Wang Ling. Even if you can't win against Yi Zhiyang, at least you can give Nanhai Tianzhong a second place seat.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong has consumed 5 clone swords." Tang Jingze looked calm. He sighed in his heart at the financial resources of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Classmate Wang Ling is really lucky. But what if I can survive. In the end, I will still lose to me."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This clone sword seems to be very convenient to consume. But in fact, the value of each clone sword is extremely high.</p>

    <p>She Jianbao players. This is enough to prove Sun Rong's determination to deal with the game.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although the outcome of this battle seems to have been decided by the outside world, in Tang Jingze's eyes, it is still difficult to determine the winner.</p>

    <p>The most important reason.</p>

    <p>Although Yi Zhiyang used the amplification power brought by his Wuji Sword to eliminate several people. But in the final analysis, the person currently facing Yi Zhiyang is Sun Rong! At such a close distance. Sun Rongt's just that the sacrificial sword protected his teammates. The clone sword was not consumed on himself!</p>

    <p>This means that Sun Rong has withstood the pressure of this sword energy!</p>

    <p>Why is this happening?</p>

    <p>For a while, many people fell into thinking.</p>

    <p>The root cause is the problem of the sword-spirit nature.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang's Yangli Sword Spirit is certainly powerful. However, Sun Rong's Aohai is a gentle water-based sword spirit. It contains the power of four ounces. When the fist hits the water, although it can cause ripples, it may not be able to. Causes damage to water... After "The Fusion of Man and Sword", Aohai is attached to the girl's body. The azure blue dress it transforms into is the best body-protecting halo.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong swayed her slender body slightly. Although Yi Zhiyang's sword intention did not trigger her golden protective talisman, it still caused internal injuries to her.</p>

    <p>The girl raised her hand to wipe away the blood that overflowed from the corner of her mouth. The expression on her face was full of joy.</p>

    <p>A showdown between geniuses must be a showdown between heroes.</p>

    <p>Especially when both parties were unwilling to admit defeat, the game seemed to become more interesting. It was watched by countless pairs of eyes. Sun Rong took a deep breath. Then she unfolded her sleeves. I saw clones of Aohai being taken out from her sword spirit space one after another...</p>

    <p>When the remaining 40 cloned Aohai were lingering around Sun Rong, everyone suddenly understood Sun Rong's strategy.</p>

    <p>Since "quality" cannot be guaranteed, then "quantity" will win!</p>

    <p>This is undoubtedly a big gamble!</p>

    <p>However, everyone still has doubts about whether the girl has the ability to control 40 spiritual swords at the same time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is watching secretly. If he wants to take action, he must not make it too obvious.</p>

    <p>The Wuji Sword is too strong. There is already a certain difference in combat power. If I help Sun Rong forcefully reverse the situation, Sun Rong will definitely be questioned.</p>

    <p>What he has to do is to adapt to circumstances, wait for opportunities, and then conduct secret operations.</p>

    <p>While protecting Sun Rong, try to make the two of them draw as close as possible.</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ling thought of. The best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There are a total of 40 spiritual swords. Just operating them requires a huge amount of spiritual and mental power... Wang Ling has observed that Sun Rong's forehead is steaming. This is because of excessive mental power. It is a manifestation of concentration. Just like the overheating reaction of a computer when running multiple programs at the same time. Once it reaches an unloadable state, it will inevitably cause freezes.</p>

    <p>And that time is Yi Zhiyang's opportunity to defeat the enemy!</p>

    <p>Therefore, many people were skeptical at the beginning as to whether Sun Rong could truly be controlled.</p>

    <p>But the facts prove that the genius' operational ability is beyond everyone's imagination.</p>

    <p>At the next moment, forty Aohai clones turned into a meteor sword shower, dragging a splendid rainbow into the sky. They arranged the sword array in the air according to Sun Rong's will, constantly changing their directions, and bombarded Yi Zhiyang overwhelmingly. And go!</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang always crossed his arms and maintained a cold posture. The Yangli Sword behind him emitted a holy light like a bright sun, burning the nearby air.</p>

    <p>The rising temperature made everyone nearby feel the heat in the air. The heat could be felt from a long distance away. The core temperature was absolutely terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Is this to raise the temperature and melt those cloned Aohai swords?" someone said.</p>

    <p>Although the core temperature is extremely high, it is still a bit of a fantasy to melt the clone sword. Yi Zhiyang is like a small sun. But it never reaches the temperature that is really like the sun.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the real purpose of the other party is not to "melt" Aohai. It is to make Sun Rong enter an overload state in advance!</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong is trying to control forty spiritual swords. The temperature of his body has already risen. As long as Yi Zhiyang adds a little more firewood, the result will inevitably be an overload state.</p>

    <p>Such a method is shameless, but it is still a safe strategy and tactic.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for Sun Rong to not see such a deceitful thought.</p>

    <p>She knew she couldn't drag it out any longer. Now she was controlling forty Aohai, and this wave was her final blow with all her strength, "Study!"</p>

    <p>The result of such desperate efforts is naturally a lose-lose situation in the end.</p>

    <p>And it's obvious. Sun Rong's injury may be more serious...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling conducted battle deductions based on the scene in front of him, he had already seen the results.</p>

    <p>It's not okay to go on like this.</p>

    <p>So. At the moment when Sun Rong's forty clones Aohai were about to collide with Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling switched out his own King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>In just one breath, the entire time of the universe came to a brief pause.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>During the pause. Wang Ling did three things.</p>

    <p>The first thing is to use cooling spells to cool down Sun Rong's whole body.</p>

    <p>The second thing is to adjust the position of the forty cloned Aohai.</p>

    <p>The third thing. Aim a few of these swords at Yi Zhiyang's butt...</p>

    <p>This sword energy barrier seems to be seamless, but in fact there is a way to crack it.</p>

    <p>And the life gate of Yi Zhiyang is located in this tail vertebra.</p>
