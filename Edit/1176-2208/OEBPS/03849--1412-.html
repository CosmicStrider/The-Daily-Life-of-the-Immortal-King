  <h1>Chapter 1412 Fansi City must die</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Before leaving. Sun Rong had a vague feeling that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>The girl raised her head and stared at the night sky. She didn't know why she felt like there was a vague murderous aura coming from outside.</p>

    <p>But she wasn't sure. She thought it was just an illusion.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Ying'er and Er Ha also felt it.</p>

    <p>After upgrading to a divine beast, Er Ha can feel the power of chaos distributed in the universe. These powers of chaos have become another major sensory organ of Er Ha, making its perception of "malice" particularly obvious.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Ying'er, as the Lord of the Void and also Sun Rong's personal bodyguard, still has the most basic awareness of precautions.</p>

    <p>"Do you feel a faint murderous aura?" At this time, Er Ha looked at the girl and asked.</p>

    <p>"eh..." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"Don't doubt yourself. Your judgment is not wrong." Er Ha frowned.</p>

    <p>In the passive version of the "human-sword-in-one" state, the sword energy emitted by Aohai is also like an amplifying device installed on the girl's body. It greatly enhances Sun Rong's ability to predict danger.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel like it's coming from the universe?" Sun Rong felt it. She stared at a direction in the sky. That was the direction of the Eye of Heaven.</p>

    <p>"It seems to be a satellite. It is trying to launch an attack here." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"Satellite?" the girl was surprised.</p>

    <p>There are not many offensive satellites used as weapons now. The {E-Bomb Raining Down From Above} developed by the Huaxiu National Cultivation and Magic Weapon Research Institute is actually still a devastating strike weapon launched through satellites.</p>

    <p>Around the world, countries have strict controls on weapons satellites. Even the Huaguo Shuilian Group does not have the right to launch weapons satellites.</p>

    <p>Er Ha breathed out into the void. The weapons-type satellite that was trying to attack the Sun Rong family in the universe was projected into the void like a mirage.</p>

    <p>"Judging from the scale of the weapon, we can basically tell that this is a private satellite." Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>The Huaguo Shuilian Group once launched artificial lighting-assisted satellites for cultivating spiritual plants into space. Therefore, the girl actually did some research on the classification of satellites.</p>

    <p>The state-used weapons satellite is a huge thing, and it has a clear national flag logo on it. Only private satellites are blank.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that even now, there are still people who want your life." Er Ha couldn't help but sigh. No matter who was behind it, it was mourning for this troublemaker.</p>

    <p>Not everyone can be messed with.</p>

    <p>What's more, the person I'm provoking now is the strongest Foundation Building on the planet...</p>

    <p>"Forget it. No matter who it is, it's more important to recover the Rubik's Cube now. And I have more important things to do after I come back." Sun Rong extracted one of the split Aohai from Aohai's sword spirit space. Staying here to sit in the villa. Not taking the target of the attack seriously at all.</p>

    <p>"Then let's go."</p>

    <p>Er Ha feels that the girl's style of dealing with things has become more mature.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, they followed Lord Ma's teleportation golden light to the mysterious "Star of Ages" in the universe to recover the fourth Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>The split body Aohai stayed here alone in the empty room. There was a bit of emptiness in his sapphire eyes. The breeze outside the window blew the curls at the end of his hair. The silver-gray hair was beating softly like waves.</p>

    <p>Xingxing Apartment. Everything is ready.</p>

    <p>"Eye of the Sky" has completed the adsorption of meteorites.</p>

    <p>With just one command, a precise attack can be carried out on the villa where Sun Rong lives.</p>

    <p>"Let's do it." Fan Xing gave the final order.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Sky Eye's mechanical ejection device violently pushes the meteorite into orbit according to calculations. In an instant, the meteorite is lasing out, falling into the atmosphere, and then friction, generating huge energy!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the sky split open and spread rapidly forward! Terrible energy erupted!</p>

    <p>This Sky Eye is a weapon that Fan Xing secretly convened many civilian scientists to discuss and design drawings, and commissioned a craftsman to build it himself.</p>

    <p>For this, he paid a huge price!</p>

    <p>At the same time, this is also the first time Fan Xing uses the Sky Eye.</p>

    <p>"Master Shou Chong really doesn't deceive me... The power of this Heavenly Eye is indeed powerful enough! It's so useful!" Fan Xing stared at the picture transmitted back from the monitor. He was not very happy in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had really found the right person. And the "Master Shou Chong" he praised was the real name of the folk craft master.</p>

    <p>This craftsman is called: Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>"Master, everything is operating normally now. The meteorite has entered the planned orbit according to the calculation of the Sky Eye. It can land on the villa accurately." A technician said.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was also very curious about the "handicraft expert" Fan Xing found: "Where did the young master find this person?"</p>

    <p>"I met him by chance. I saw him wandering around the gate of the Academy of Sciences. Then he was stopped by the security guard at the gate every time. I went to ask about the situation out of curiosity. I didn't expect to find such a talent by accident. I have invested a lot of money into him. Now many of the devices he invented are in the testing stage. Patents will be applied for soon."</p>

    <p>Fan Xing smiled and said: "If it can be put into mass production and launched in the future, the technology empire I established may not be worse than the Huaguo Shuilian Group!"</p>

    <p>In the past two years, with the over-exploitation of spiritual plants, the market price of spiritual plants has continued to increase. As the cost of elixirs has gone up, the selling price will naturally increase. This directly leads to the fact that people who could not afford elixirs can no longer afford them. People who are looking for elixirs think it is not worth it.</p>

    <p>It is no secret that Dan Pharmaceuticals of Huaguo Shuilian Group has been losing money for many years. It has been going downhill in the past two years.</p>

    <p>In Fan Xing's view, now is the era of rejuvenating the country through science and technology! And he has discovered talents like "Shou Chong." This is undoubtedly a shot in the arm for his technology company!</p>

    <p>Currently, Fan Xing's investment in Shou Chong amounts to billions.</p>

    <p>And Shou Chong has lived up to his expectations. He has invented many amazing high-tech products.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing proudly said: "The 180Â° all-round inverted automatic hair washing machine will be on the market soon. Just put your head over it. It can automatically clean and dry your head in all directions within 30 seconds."</p>

    <p>Technician: "..."</p>

    <p>Fan Xing: "And you may not know it yet. This apartment building is actually a high-tech cutting-edge product invented by Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>"Apartment buildings too?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Fan Xing nodded: "This apartment building is explosion-proof and earthquake-proof. It also has an automatic early warning system. When the apartment's intelligent AI system determines that the apartment suffers an unbearable devastating blow, it will automatically activate. Emergency evacuation system..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Fan Xing hadn't finished speaking. The technician at the front suddenly screamed loudly: "It's not good, Master!"</p>

    <p>"Eh? What's going on?" Fan Xing frowned.</p>

    <p>"The meteorite we launched originally landed accurately in the direction of the Sun family villa. But for some reason... the meteorite was bounced back by a very strong force! Now the Sky Eye shows that the meteorite is returning to the sending address..."</p>

    <p>"Return to shipping address?"</p>

    <p>"It's coming in our direction..."</p>

    <p>"Don't panic!"</p>

    <p>Fan Xing reassured: "Xinxing Apartment is explosion-proof and earthquake-proof!"</p>

    <p>The technician wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>It's true that it's explosion-proof and earthquake-proof... but it doesn't seem to say anything about meteorite-proof!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the thing that worries everyone the most happened!</p>

    <p>The apartment building's "emergency evacuation system" alarm has sounded!</p>

    <p>The power of the meteorite is too great. With the explosion-proof level of the apartment, it is impossible to withstand it!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing was stunned for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>Then, the ceiling on the top of the apartment building automatically opened.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the sound of a series of springs firing.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing followed all the employees around him and was ejected directly from the apartment. He carried out emergency evacuation.</p>

    <p>The incident happened suddenly. They were ejected very high, thousands of meters above the ground...</p>

    <p>Fan Xing is flying in the air with everyone around him.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he finally couldn't help but curse.</p>

    <p>Only then did Fan Xing discover that Shou Chong's "Emergency Evacuation System"... was only responsible for launching, not landing!</p>

    <p>(I have something to do at home today. The update is a bit late. There will be a second update about 8 o'clock)</p>
