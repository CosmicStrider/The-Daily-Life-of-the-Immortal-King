  <h1>Chapter 1404 Sword Spirit Audition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the reward promised by Bai Qiao, Jiu You is naturally full of motivation. Although this Sword conference is a temporary initiative, it must not be made to look like it is temporary. The pomp must be big enough. Only in this way can it bring joy to the human girl. A real sense of experience.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the participating sword spirits should not be too strong.</p>

    <p>Spirit swords that are at least ranked before Aohai cannot participate.</p>

    <p>These spirit swords will be directly assigned to the judges' order.</p>

    <p>In a quiet room in the Sword King Kaiwang Palace, Jiu You started a meeting with Carter, Wu Jin, and Lao Man.</p>

    <p>"Although time is tight, I think it is still necessary to make a selection to improve the overall quality of our contestants this time."</p>

    <p>Jiu You was hunched over his desk. His hands never stopped during the whole process. He kept taking minutes of the meeting on his notebook: "This competition is actually a good opportunity. Because the ranking data of the sword ranking is automatically generated by the sword ranking. Ranking It also changes in real time based on the status of the spirit sword. So there are actually many sword spirits who have doubts about the ranking of the sword list."</p>

    <p>"What Master Jiu You means is that by taking this opportunity, on the one hand, Miss Sun will be determined to win. On the other hand, it can also allow all the sword spirits to verify the authenticity of the sword list?" Lao Man said, stroking his beard.</p>

    <p>"Although what you said, Lao Man, is correct. But you have to remember... you can never be so frank outside." Jiu You smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>This Sword Conference is indeed held specifically for Sun Rong. And no surprise. Sun Rong is the default candidate for the championship.</p>

    <p>How could this girl be Master Bai Qiao's disciple?</p>

    <p>However, this matter can only be understood but not spoken... strict confidentiality must be maintained.</p>

    <p>This is the routine of the so-called variety show. It is not uncommon for the winner to be determined by default.</p>

    <p>If the power of capital wants to make an artist famous, in addition to providing enough topic resources, it is also the minimum to provide a championship package.</p>

    <p>"The current ranking of the sword list only counts the unknown sword spirits before the 100,000th place. I don't think there is a need to participate in the competition." Jiu You said: "But the number of famous sword spirits on the list is still too many. Our ideal format for this competition is 1,000 sword spirits. Therefore, we still have to go through auditions."</p>

    <p>"What do you think, Lord Jiu You?"</p>

    <p>"In order to ensure that the Sword Spirits in each stage can participate. My current idea is to divide the Sword Spirits into 5 small ancestors: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and King. Then each group will decide 200 winners." Jiu You said.</p>

    <p>The other people immediately understood what Jiu You meant. Among the famous sword spirits on the 100,000 list.</p>

    <p>According to this division, among the 100,000 sword spirits, the number 1 and 19,999 are the king group.</p>

    <p>Diamond Group Number 20000 to Number 39999...</p>

    <p>By analogy, the 100,000 sword spirits will be divided into groups. Then each group will go through a certain selection mode to select 200 winners.</p>

    <p>In this way, we can ensure that there are sword spirits selected at all levels, and they are all sword spirits with high overall quality.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is how the groups are divided.</p>

    <p>It is the sword spirit's own choice to participate or not. If you do not register, it will be deemed as an automatic forfeit.</p>

    <p>So actually, when it comes to the audition stage, each group may not reach 20,000 people.</p>

    <p>For example, the champion group will lose many strong competitors.</p>

    <p>After all, everyone ranked in front of Aohai is going to be a judge...</p>

    <p>So now it is just an assumption. If every group is full, how to conduct grouping and audition.</p>

    <p>"What about the audition? What will Miss Sun do?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun doesn't need to participate in the audition. There are so many people anyway, so we can't see her. Just advance directly when the time comes."</p>

    <p>"Eh... The last thing is... 200 people will be decided in each group? This is a good idea. But I still think it is unfair? The lowest ranking in the king group can also win the bronze, right?" Wu Jin asked.</p>

    <p>"My idea is that it would be better to pre-determine a few more champions. After the 200 sword spirits in each group are divided, the 200 sword spirits will then fight in a melee until the top spot is determined. And the top spot in each group.</p>

    <p>There are rewards." Jiu Tao Novel Jiu You thought very thoughtfully: "This can also avoid some gossip. However, the reward for the first place in the group is not the Jian Shen alloy. It is an opportunity to protect the sword in the palace."</p>

    <p>"The king's palace... Great Protection Sword..." The corners of the mouths of Wu Jin and Lao Man twitched.</p>

    <p>"It's just a full-body conditioning for the sword body. Xiao Qian and I will apply the lubricant!"</p>

    <p>"So perverted..." Even Carter couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>"Hey. You guys underestimated the allure of the Imperial Palace Sword project. Just this project. I don't know how many sword spirits would have to fight for their scalps." Jiu You sighed. He gestured with his hand to apply lubricant. Looks like. It does look very professional.</p>

    <p>According to Jiu You's current thinking.</p>

    <p>After the first place in the five groups is born, each top place will get a chance to win the Royal Palace Sword. This is the basic reward.</p>

    <p>And the real grand prize, which is "Jian Shen Alloy", will be born after the melee of the top five groups.</p>

    <p>No surprise. This alloy will definitely be captured by Sun Rong and Aohai.</p>

    <p>But now. The problem before everyone is.</p>

    <p>What selection model should be used? Reduce the number of people in each group from 20,000 and audition to 200 people.</p>

    <p>First of all, a melee competition is definitely unrealistic.</p>

    <p>When there are too many sword spirits, it is difficult to control the field.</p>

    <p>At that time, each of the 20,000 sword spirits turned into a sword light and flew around in the sky. It was like setting off fireworks... I was dizzy just looking at it!</p>

    <p>"Should we link up with the Sword Ranking to launch a special voting area and let the Sword Spirits perform their talents? Let all Sword Spirits openly vote. And the famous Sword Spirits on the Sword Ranking can vote twice!" Wu Jin suggested.</p>

    <p>This proposal was directly rejected by Jiu You: "We are not {Idol Sword Apprentices}. What is a sword spirit doing to perform talents? Moreover, the open voting mechanism is not conducive to Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>"Yes..." Wu Jin nodded.</p>

    <p>Carter originally wanted to raise her hand to propose. She had an idea for {Creation 202}. But after seeing Wu Jin being rejected, she silently put down her hand.</p>

    <p>"It seems that everyone seems to be gloomy. So now, there is only one way left..."</p>

    <p>Jiu You stopped taking notes and rested his chin on his fingers.</p>

    <p>In fact, this method is very old. But it is indeed very applicable in such situations.</p>

    <p>"The method you mentioned can't be..." Wu Jin already knew it when he saw Jiu You's slightly old-school movements.</p>

    <p>"It seems that this is the only way. It is the least messy and the fairest way." Lao Man also thought of it.</p>

    <p>"So what is the solution?" Carter was still puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Carter. Your reaction is too slow."</p>

    <p>Jiu You smiled deeply. Then he ordered Xiao Qian outside the door: "Go and make an announcement to the whole world. Let the sword spirits who are interested in participating in the competition gather at Jian Shen Square."</p>

    <p>Jian Shen Plaza...</p>

    <p>It was only then that Carter finally came to his senses.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this ancient method is to use the ancient sword monument in Jian Shen Square to test the combat power data of sword energy!</p>

    <p>"It seems you finally thought of it. Carter."</p>

    <p>Lao Man snorted and smiled: "The sword spirits of the older generation have all done the sword tablet test. I think back then, when I struck down with my sword, I had the ninth level of sword power!"</p>
