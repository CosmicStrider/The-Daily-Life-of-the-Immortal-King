  <h1>Chapter 1494 The Nightmare of Jiugong Liangzi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Sun Rong. This time... thank you very much."</p>

    <p>After getting the exact answer, Jiugong Liangzi finally felt a little relieved.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome Jiugong." Sun Rong said with a smile. The smile was very generous and sincere: "I know Liangzi has always regarded me as an opponent. In fact, I have been chosen as an opponent by Jiugong. I have felt deeply. Pleasure."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed immediately after hearing these words.</p>

    <p>I have to say that Sun Rong's "Mind Attacking Technique" is indeed superb. And the so-called "Sun Rong Domain" is actually an enhanced passive version of the "Mind Attacking Technique."</p>

    <p>As the future heir of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, Mr. Boss Sun has also been very comprehensive in training Sun Rong since childhood.</p>

    <p>Observe words and emotions, watch your heart and attack your plans. In fact, this is also a business tactic.</p>

    <p>Ever since Sun Rong determined that Jiugong Liangzi was different from Jiang Yingying and didn't really like Wang Ling, she changed her strategy towards Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>From the initial targeting to the win-win cooperation now, everything is to help Zhuo Yi capture the "Plains Beauty" in front of them as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>And it turns out that Sun Rong's trick is indeed very effective.</p>

    <p>"Don't get me wrong, classmate Sun Rong... This time, it's just a temporary cooperation! You will always be my opponent!" Jiugong Liangzi blushed.</p>

    <p>She tried to disguise herself as "super fierce", but she didn't realize that her big eyes were staring. Instead, she looked very silly and cute.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi, there is no need to thank me. If you want to thank me, just thank senior Zhuo Yi. He arranged everything. I have never seen senior Zhuo Yi ask for help." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi crossed his arms and pouted: "Really... I want him to mind his own business..."</p>

    <p>Although he said that, Sun Rong really felt that it was more like coquettishness.</p>

    <p>"Also. I want to know if the two people traveling with classmate Sun Rong are reliable?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, classmate Liangzi. These two are our own. One is classmate Wang Ling. You have already met him. The other classmate is Wang Xiaoer who is on leave of absence."</p>

    <p>"I know classmate Wang Ling...is that dead fish-eyed guy with beautiful features?" Jiugong Liangzi shrugged. She didn't pay much attention to Wang Ling because she hasn't had the effect of the medicine now. Who cares? They are all dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>In contrast, she was actually more concerned about Wang Ming: "Speaking of which, who is this Wang Xiaoer? You said they are all one of our own. What does this mean?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't Zhuo Yi senior tell you?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Sun Rong smiled and said: "Classmate Wang Ling and classmate Wang Xiaoer are actually his disciples. But this matter has not been made public yet. I hope classmate Liangzi can keep it secret."</p>

    <p>"He actually has disciples?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Sun Rong said: "Zhuo Yi senior is so powerful. Of course, you have to choose the right person to inherit your mantle."</p>

    <p>"so it is..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiugong Liangzi showed an expression of sudden realization and nodded repeatedly like a chicken pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, is Liangzi still doubting Senior Zhuo Yi? He is a man of real talent and learning." At this time, Sun Rong asked deliberately.</p>

    <p>"I just think it's necessary to investigate..."</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior is a good man. And considering his age, it shouldn't be a problem for you." Sun Rong said deliberately.</p>

    <p>"I am a minor!" Jiugong Liangzi emphasized.</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way. I almost forgot. Liangzi is the same age as me."</p>

    <p>"..." I don't know if it was my imagination. Jiugong Liangzi suddenly discovered that Sun Rong always seemed to have something to say.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of her was much scarier than she imagined...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Sun Island Exchange Student Plan. In fact, this was proposed by Jiugong's family from the very beginning. It can be regarded as an advance arrangement by Jiugong Liangzi to prevent changes within the family.</p>

    <p>In fact, this plan has been in the process of being implemented. It can be activated at any time as long as Jiugong Liangzi gives an order.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that Jiugong Liangzi would have such a thoughtful mind at such a young age. And Jiugong Liangzi did not expect that his plan to set up the situation in advance would come into use so quickly.</p>

    <p>If possible.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hopes that he will never use this plan in his life.</p>

    <p>That night, Jiugong Liangzi closed his eyes and tossed and turned on the bed, thinking about a lot of things. He didn't know how long it took before he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

    <p>In her dream, she found herself walking on a frozen lake.</p>

    <p>A blizzard obscured her view.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Jiugong Liangzi found that he could not see the road in front of him clearly.</p>

    <p>The faces beneath her feet were smiling at her at first. Then they suddenly turned into ghosts and jumped out of the frozen lake. They turned into various ferocious forms and rushed towards her.</p>

    <p>"Is this the dream again..."</p>

    <p>This is not the first time Jiugong Liangzi has dreamed of such a nightmarish scene.</p>

    <p>She stood silently in the blizzard. She watched these ghostly faces impact her body, letting them turn into masks that were difficult to tear off. They were layered on her jade-white cheeks.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when. She began to find that her family was becoming more and more complicated.</p>

    <p>When she was a child, the big and happy family that was so warm in her heart that it could melt everything away gradually began to be covered by undercurrents under various shadows...</p>

    <p>He didn't know when it started. Jiugong Liangzi found that his smile began to diminish.</p>

    <p>She began to learn to disguise, began to learn to fake a smile, began to learn to wear the cold face of society, to deal with all the difficulties in front of her.</p>

    <p>She seemed to have turned into the person she hated the most.</p>

    <p>All the changes, all the helplessness, made Jiugong Liangzi like a frightened bird.</p>

    <p>Live cautiously. Walking on thin ice...</p>

    <p>And in such a doomsday scene, Jiugong Liangzi has been gone for a long time.</p>

    <p>"It should be over soon..." She mentally estimated the duration of this nightmare. She felt that she was about to wake up.</p>

    <p>But what happened to the girl was that...</p>

    <p>This doomsday nightmare of hers, for the first time, has a follow-up...</p>

    <p>At this time, she was walking alone on the ice, enduring the impact of the blizzard and grimaces.</p>

    <p>A ray of light suddenly penetrated the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the blizzard dissipated and there were no clouds in the sky. The frozen lake surface was illuminated by the sun. All those annoying faces were evaporated one by one and completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi!"</p>

    <p>The familiar voice made Jiugong Liangzi instantly look forward in the direction of the voice.</p>

    <p>And at the end of that voice was a man standing on the river bank waving to him, smiling at him...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiugong Liangzi felt as if something had hit him in his heart.</p>

    <p>The makeup on the face is like peeling off dead skin, peeling off the cheeks layer by layer, and then turning into powder...</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi..."</p>

    <p>She looked at the person in front of her in disbelief. Just as she was about to walk away, her dream suddenly shrank.</p>

    <p>When Jiugong Liangzi woke up, it was already the next morning.</p>

    <p>After waking up, the girl hugged her knees, like a frightened little hedgehog. She huddled up on the bed for a long time.</p>

    <p>She actually dreamed of Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>It's crazy!</p>

    <p>...</p>
