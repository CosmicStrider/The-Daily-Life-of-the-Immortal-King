  <h1>Chapter 1931 The secret of this spiritual world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is the only building that Wang Ling can see with the naked eye. A very simple wooden house. But it gives people an infinite sense of security. Especially when you see the national flag of the Cultivation Country fluttering in the wind. Wang Ling will spontaneously feel a sense of pride and awe in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels faced with this flag most of his peers have the same feeling as him.</p>

    <p>In a daze, there was a hiss. An arrow shot through the air from the window of the wooden house.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face was expressionless. The sword fingers came together to clamp the arrow firmly.</p>

    <p>He deliberately released his aura to Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan. As expected by Wang Ling. The vigilance of these two people was not too low. And soon Zhang Linyan shot the arrow as a test.</p>

    <p>Behind the thick tree, Wang Ling walked out slowly with arrows in hand. On the other side of the wooden house, Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan saw the same electronic bracelet on Wang Ling's wrist. The expressions on their faces were also sudden, both stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>Judging from their reactions, the two of them probably knew that there were actually four people entering the spirit world this time. But obviously they did not expect that the fourth person who came turned out to be someone from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Obviously, when we were at Suzaku Gate before, there was no one from Number 60 High School. How did Wang Ling get in?</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan felt very strange. But in the current situation, Wang Ling was obviously a teammate. She had no choice but to invite Wang Ling in. She was the first to break the deadlock: "This classmate, come in."</p>

    <p>During the whole process, Qu Shuling's face always maintained a thoughtful look. Although Zhang Linyan's arrow just now did not use all his strength, the speed of the arrow was also extremely fast. An arrow from the early stage of Golden Core's cultivation. It was caught by a Foundation Building guy...</p>

    <p>This made Qu Shuling vaguely feel that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. Ignoring Qu Shuling's weird look, he followed the steps given by Zhang Linyan and entered the wooden house.</p>

    <p>The scene in the wooden house made Wang Ling look a little dazed.</p>

    <p>Because there is actually an elevator inside this wooden house that can accommodate up to twenty people. And the elevator only has a downward button. This means that there is other space under the land they are stepping on.</p>

    <p>In addition, on the wall next to the glass elevator, there is a 32-inch LCD screen. In addition to showing the countdown of their trip, it also says "Number 1 Underground Trial" Field-412" text.</p>

    <p>"Don't stare, obviously our mission this time is to make the elevator leading to the so-called No.1 underground testing ground below." Zhang Linyan said: "The 412 on the side should be talking about the number of people, this proving ground needs a minimum of 4 people to be able to open it, and the maximum number of people at one time is 12."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>It feels like this layout is actually a bit like a game dungeon. There are exactly four of them here, just enough to start this level of dungeon missions.</p>

    <p>This also explains why Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan seemed to know as if there was a fourth person in the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>After all, there is a minimum number of people. No matter how the superiors arrange it, they will definitely ensure that at least four people enter the spirit world this time.</p>

    <p>"There shouldn't be anyone else coming in." Qu Shuling said coldly. Neither he nor Zhang Linyan actually knew that the door outside had been destroyed by Wang Ling. But the invitation letter had a clear deadline. 0:00 in the real world.</p>

    <p>And now the countdown after they arrived in the spirit world has exceeded ten minutes. Judging from the time, the remaining people should not be able to get here.</p>

    <p>Currently, only the four of them can enter.</p>

    <p>But even so, it actually lacked Li Changzhe's fighting ability. Zhang Linyan judged from the swollen bulge on Li Changzhe's head that Li Changzhe probably hit his head.</p>

    <p>He bumped into the door. As a result, he also knocked himself unconscious...</p>

    <p>A bit tigerish.</p>

    <p>But it seems like Li Changzhe's usual style.</p>

    <p>There was no other way. Wang Ling had to take the initiative to help Li Changzhe up and carry him on his back. It didn't take much effort for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You don't seem to talk much, but I didn't expect you to be very warm-hearted." Zhang Linyan's favorable impression of the proactive Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not that Wang Ling is willing to carry Li Changzhe on his back. It's just that in this situation, he can't directly use healing spells to reduce Li Changzhe's swelling. Otherwise, he will look a little guilty.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he felt that Li Changzhe fainted mainly because of himself.</p>

    <p>It's just a long journey. On the way, he will find opportunities to revive Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling always crossed his arms, maintaining his usual aloof style of being arrogant. He didn't know who exactly Wang Ling was from Number 60 High School. But after all, Number 60 High School was ranked in the bottom thirty. Like this Ranking has never been an opponent in Qu Shuling's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Come in, everyone."</p>

    <p>He sighed, pressed the elevator button, and walked in first. Then he glanced at Wang Ling, who was carrying Li Changzhe on his back: "You are in sixty high, right. Don't hold back."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remained silent. He didn't pay any attention to Qu Shuling's words.</p>

    <p>As a result, the whole atmosphere in the elevator dropped to freezing point. Zhang Linyan was caught in the middle. She felt that she was in a difficult position. It was extremely uncomfortable. She could only think of ways to find a topic: "This Li Changzhe. Do you think he is stupid..."</p>

    <p>She hoped that Li Changzhe would wake up soon. After all, she and Wang Ling were not familiar with Qu Shuling. That meant that Li Changzhe and Qu Shuling still had something to say.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in a team environment, an atmosphere group member is still needed to adjust the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>And Li Changzhe obviously belongs to this atmosphere group.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually feels a little sorry for Zhang Linyan. It can be seen that she is trying very hard to find a topic. But Qu Shuling is aloof and cold. He doesn't like to talk. She feels like she is sandwiched between two pieces of frozen soil. The penguin in the elevator was so embarrassed that she could use his toes to dig out the entire spiritual world map in the elevator.</p>

    <p>It was only a few dozen seconds of elevator ride. For the first time, Zhang Linyan felt that there was no more love in the world.</p>

    <p>"Ding! You have arrived at Underground Proving Ground Number 1..."</p>

    <p>As the elevator door slowly opened, the scene in front of them once again made Wang Ling and others feel horrified.</p>

    <p>The elevator door is embedded in a huge tree. In front of the huge bonfire, a group of young foreign cultivators with various hair colors and eye colors are dancing various exotic dances around the bonfire.</p>

    <p>They were wearing the uniforms of their respective schools. Some of them even had their uniforms dirty and tattered. But you could still tell which cultivation country they came from from the armbands they wore on their arms.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling looked at the scene in front of him in astonishment.</p>

    <p>He remembered that he had heard about something called the "Spirit World Project" from Dai Tianchun, the principal of Shengke.</p>

    <p>According to rumors, it is the Jingyuan of cultivators from various countries. An independent secret realm established to quickly cultivate the younger generation of cultivators...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling didn't expect this to be true.</p>

    <p>Of course. There is one thing that Qu Shuling cannot understand.</p>

    <p>That is the group of cultivators from other countries in front of us. It seems as if they have been in this world for a long time... What on earth is going on?</p>

    <p>"I understand." At this time, Zhang Linyan frowned and said seriously: "The countdown outside is actually a countdown to clearing the level. We must clear the level within a limited time. Otherwise, we will stay here until the next group of people. Enter the spirit world trial field. And wait until you pass the level!"</p>
