  <h1>Chapter 1481 Kidnapper! Danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hearing the word "durian", Jiugong Liangzi's expression brightened up.</p>

    <p>"Ah! You... also like to eat durian?"</p>

    <p>To be honest, the girl was a little touched in her heart. After all, many people around her thought durian was smelly. Even the servants would stay away when she usually ate it.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Zhuo Yi actually had the same idea as her. He also likes to eat durian.</p>

    <p>"Isn't durian the most fragrant fruit in the world?"</p>

    <p>At this time, he looked at the girl with a smile in his eyes and said.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi suddenly revealed his starry eyes.</p>

    <p>Although it only passed by in a flash.</p>

    <p>But it is really rare to see such a rare expression on Jiugong Liangzi's face.</p>

    <p>"How much does this durian cost?" Zhuo Yi squatted half-crouched and asked the melon stall owner.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he looked around and selected carefully.</p>

    <p>He found that this fruit stall was not only down-to-earth, but also quite rich in variety. Even durians had several different varieties.</p>

    <p>"Strange. In your country, can you set up street stalls casually?" At this time, the girl asked curiously.</p>

    <p>The melon-eating stall owner put his hands on his hips and wiped the watermelon juice on his mouth with a sweat towel. He smiled honestly and said, "Little girl, you don't understand this. This is called street stall economy. Now everyone is strongly supporting it. It is very important to the development of people's livelihood." It's very helpful. But you should also pay attention to the cleanliness of the stall. Be sure to take away the garbage when you leave."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Jiugong Liangzi nodded.</p>

    <p>The differences between cultures are not terrible. What is more important is respect and understanding.</p>

    <p>For a country with a long history and culture like Huaxiu, Jiugong Liangzi has longed for it since he was a child.</p>

    <p>One person's life is just a drop in the ocean compared to the long history of a country.</p>

    <p>The country of Huaxiu has a strong cultural heritage of cultivation. It is also one of the reasons that has always attracted cultivators from all over the world to visit and study.</p>

    <p>"I know this is an ordinary durian. What is that red durian?" At this time, Zhuo Yi suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>"That's a new product. Its full name is Flame Durian. It tastes a little sweet and spicy when you eat it."</p>

    <p>"Sweet and spicy... would that be delicious..."</p>

    <p>"I don't know if it tastes good or not. But it does sell well."</p>

    <p>The melon-eating stall owner looked at Zhuo Yi and took the initiative to tell the truth: "Actually, many people buy this flaming durian to kneel down for the men at home. This is just in case the skin of their knees is broken when kneeling. This flaming durian The spiciness will penetrate directly into the skin..."</p>

    <p>"That's it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled and said: "That's okay. Mainly because I haven't tried this new product before. So just have one regular one and one new one. The boss can just pick the biggest and freshest one for me."</p>

    <p>"Okay."</p>

    <p>With a shout, the stall owner skillfully packed the things for Zhuo Yi to take back.</p>

    <p>On the way, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly thought of something. She looked at Zhuo Yi and asked: "Well... you should be able to split a durian with your bare hands, right?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled. And now he was in front of Jiugong Liangzi. This made him look a little light: "With my current fighting power, I can more than split it with my bare hands. When I get back, I will kneel down for you."</p>

    <p>"Can you crush a durian on your knees?" Jiugong Liangzi raised his eyebrows lightly.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhuo Yi was very proud.</p>

    <p>Little did he know that this might be the second wrong decision he ever made in his life...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong was quickly approaching her destination in a blue and white Hanfu. The bright moonlight made the girl look even more outstanding in the faint moonlight.</p>

    <p>She is like a glass immortal under the night. Her whole body exudes a touching spirituality. Anyone who sees her can't help but take a second look.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that Wang Ling is not around now.</p>

    <p>A girl can only be beautiful alone.</p>

    <p>She was a little anxious inside. She couldn't solve Jiang Yingying's matter for a moment. She couldn't make peace with Wang Ling for a moment.</p>

    <p>It was obviously hard to find the opportunity to be alone...</p>

    <p>At this time, the inner hardship and bitterness gathered together.</p>

    <p>She is so difficult...</p>

    <p>But this happened all because of her.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong feels that he must also show a sense of responsibility. This should be the responsibility that every young person should have.</p>

    <p>"This is it..."</p>

    <p>This is a dark alley located on Second Street. The dark alley is very narrow. There is only a gap of about ten centimeters wide.</p>

    <p>There is no way to get out of here in the normal way. But the location of the sound just now did come from here.</p>

    <p>The girl releases sword energy. Use the enlarged view to detect it.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, traces of spells were found on the left and right walls of the gap.</p>

    <p>"The Art of Paper Man..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>This is actually a type of "bone reduction surgery." But the actual operation is more difficult than "bone reduction surgery."</p>

    <p>The creativity of the spell is inspired by the popularity of the second generation of paper doll husbands and wives on the market nowadays....</p>

    <p>Then, the "Paper Man Technique" was born.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong's combat power is strong, the practical application of many spells is still lacking.</p>

    <p>She didn't know how to use the "Paper Man Technique." She just had an understanding of it.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. I have to ask you for help." The girl said at this time.</p>

    <p>She needed to go right through the gap to see.</p>

    <p>There is a flight ban over the ancient streets. Jumping directly over with a sword is not allowed. Not only is it easy to be fined, but it is also easy for gangsters to notice her.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er reacts quickly. The shadow can easily pass through the gaps.</p>

    <p>After the jump, she quickly changed directions with the main body, completing a gorgeous "Great Shift of the Universe."</p>

    <p>"It seems that I still have to study hard in the future."</p>

    <p>The transformation was completed successfully. At this moment, the girl felt a lot heavier in her heart.</p>

    <p>Although her combat power is indeed very strong now, most of it comes from Aohai.</p>

    <p>There are still areas that should be lacking. We must not be complacent because of this.</p>

    <p>There is no end to learning. She is indeed still far behind.</p>

    <p>After successfully passing through the narrow gap, Sun Rong discovered that the world outside the gap turned out to be an empty abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>The air exudes a rusty smell and an unpleasant smell of chemical reagents. These smells are intertwined, irritating the throat and nose.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong reacted quickly.</p>

    <p>I was fooled...</p>

    <p>This seemed like a trap from the start.</p>

    <p>The other party made a careful plan and deliberately let her hear the news that Jiang Yingying was kidnapped. Then he also knew that she would definitely find her way over.</p>

    <p>A teleportation channel was set up behind that narrow gap that could quickly replace the space. This allowed Sun Rong to arrive at another place instantly.</p>

    <p>Such means are not something ordinary kidnappers possess.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong frowned and couldn't help but become more vigilant.</p>

    <p>It seems that these kidnappers are stronger than she thought...</p>

    <p>At this time, a slightly hollow voice sounded: "Sure enough, everything is as the senior expected. You will definitely fall into the trap and come here. Miss Sun..."</p>

    <p>In the darkness, a sturdy man about three meters tall, wearing a black windbreaker, slowly walked out.</p>

    <p>He was holding a big knife in his hand, and the unconscious Jiang Yingying was held in his hand like a little chicken.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sensed the breath of this sturdy kidnapper. He felt that the smell on the kidnapper was a bit strange: "You don't seem to be human..."</p>

    <p>The strong man laughed loudly: "I underestimated you, Miss Sun. I didn't expect you even knew this."</p>

    <p>At this time Sun Rong felt slightly relieved.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't a human being, this really reassured her a lot.</p>

    <p>Because killing aliens is not illegal...</p>
