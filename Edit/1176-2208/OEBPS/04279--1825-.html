  <h1>Chapter 1825 Wang Ling's first showdown</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This Saint of the Holy Tribe had a sinister swirling face. He determined that there must be a hidden master in Number 60 High School. Therefore, after observing Jiuyun's injuries, he ran in the direction of the bus and chased him without hesitation.</p>

    <p>A murderous intent was approaching from afar. Wang Ling could tell that this person was serious. And he really had murderous intentions towards a group of students who were only in the Foundation Building and Golden Core realm. An alien whose realm far exceeded the level of the earth. A strong star race. It is as easy as stepping on ants to obliterate the Foundation Building and Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Just above the bus where Wang Ling everyone was sitting, the Holy Lord walked directly out of the center of the golden vortex. His face could not be seen clearly, but they could clearly feel a hint of laughter from the vortex.</p>

    <p>Then he took action directly, reaching up to the sky with one palm, turning it into a cage and covering it.</p>

    <p>This is the Palm Cage. A cage built with ultra-high-density psychic molecules. The interior forms its own cosmic environment. Once locked in it, it will withstand a huge amount of cosmic pressure. It is definitely not something that a cultivator from Foundation Building or Golden Core could contend with.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. What to do..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong asked anxiously via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>She could also see it. This was a tough temptation from her opponent. She wanted to directly screen out among them who was the eternal mighty person hidden among them.</p>

    <p>The girl gritted her teeth. The blue sword energy on her body was ready to go. She was ready to protect everyone on behalf of Wang Ling. Even if her strength was exposed, there was always a way to solve it later. For example erase the memories of those who saw this scene...</p>

    <p>Whether it is physical elimination or spell elimination. Sun Rong is now familiar with it.</p>

    <p>However, what Sun Rong didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>This time, the boy actually walked over with his hands in his school uniform trouser pocket.</p>

    <p>The golden vortex behind the saint released a dazzling light, illuminating the sky in front of him. Under the dazzling halo. Number 60 High School. Everyone in the Uzumaki Emperor saw it, Wang Ling walking forward alone.</p>

    <p>The young man who looked slightly thin and frail. The moment the palms of his hands collided with each other, he stretched out just one finger and the whole cage collapsed.</p>

    <p>"Wang... Ling?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Li Youyue, and the six people in the Whirlpool Emperor all opened their mouths with extreme surprise on their faces.</p>

    <p>They rubbed their eyes. They couldn't believe what they saw.</p>

    <p>"I'm not dreaming... is this really Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"So that child is really that powerful???"</p>

    <p>Especially Chen Chao and Guo Hao, who have been making Wang Ling "mascot" jokes on weekdays. The shock on their faces is almost beyond description in words.</p>

    <p>They would never have thought that Wang Ling was really a hidden top cultivator...</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a monster.</p>

    <p>Even the six members of the Uzumaki Emperor were so shocked that they broke out in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>They felt that Mrs. Lawen's various arrangements were unfair.</p>

    <p>After all, in terms of strength on paper, their average strength is stronger than the Uzumaki Emperor in Golden Core. Let a group of practitioners from the Foundation Building stage of Number 60 High School compete with them. It is really just bullying.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Forget it. They actually invited one of the team leaders of the Heavenly Dao League to pretend to be a primary school student and join the competition.</p>

    <p>But now it looks like...</p>

    <p>This arrangement seems to be reasonable.</p>

    <p>Because there is a hidden boss among the people at Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>And he is actually the one who looks the most harmless!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, streaks of golden-red immortal energy emitted from Wang Ling's school uniform. It was Wang Ling's immortal king's shield constructed from the original energy, aura and chaos power. It was applied here in an instant. On everyone.</p>

    <p>It can be clearly seen that the immortal king's shield is also blessed with various spells. It is a rune language that is completely obscure and incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>But Fang Xing probably knew the purpose of this spell.</p>

    <p>That's a designated type of memory erasing spell.</p>

    <p>People who are completely unaware of Wang Ling's affairs. They are set up so that they can only remember how strong Wang Ling is when the Immortal King's Shield is attached... Once the Immortal King's Shield is canceled, everyone's memory will turn into the state where Wang Ling is just a "mascot."</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ling is considering for the future.</p>

    <p>In this way, there is no need to erase the memories of this group of people every time...</p>

    <p>Anyway, the battle is resolved in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>"As expected, it's you! I thought there was something wrong with you!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the sky, he saw that his cage was broken. The Holy Lord had a look of surprise on his face.</p>

    <p>Palm Prison is just a basic spell used for testing. Not even one tenth of his strength is used.</p>

    <p>He rose up in the air and swept across with a kick. He wanted to shock Wang Ling to death. In an instant, his right leg was covered with runes and shrouded in golden light. The position of the sole of his foot also appeared when he kicked it. It has become a whirlpool. The space has been completely distorted. There is a force that smashes it together.</p>

    <p>The force of this kick will cause an explosive impact that will directly affect the entire area.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reacted quickly. While grabbing the foot, he pulled the opponent into his own spiritual realm.</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone in the nearby area was brought there.</p>

    <p>The inherent spiritual realm of Wang Ling is built on the basis of Number 60 High School. The feeling of returning to Number 60 High School makes many people here feel unreal.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>As expected by Wang Ling, he blocked the blow with one hand. Although he did not feel any pain on his body, the huge impact was still devastating and made the ground behind him dent.</p>

    <p>It was a pit with a radius of a thousand feet. There were cracks in all directions. This shows how powerful this kick of the Holy Lord was.</p>

    <p>But obviously, the other party underestimated Wang Ling's physical strength.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling grabbed the person's ankle with an expressionless face. It swung it in the air like a skipping rope. It violently hit the ground with an astonishing force. The inherent spiritual realm felt constant vibrations. It was as if it was being experienced. A big earthquake.</p>

    <p>He has not yet fully exerted his full strength. This Holy Lord has been transformed beyond recognition by the impact of Wang Ling being smashed again and again. The golden vortex on his face has been directly deformed. It has sunk deeply. At the same time, yellow blood is ejected from the center of the vortex.</p>

    <p>"The most powerful one who can sanctify his body..." The Holy Lord was stunned. His head was knocked unconscious.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that Wang Ling was just an ordinary Eternal-level powerhouse. However, when he launched a hasty attack, he was shocked to find that this was not the case.</p>

    <p>The young man grabbed his ankle. At that moment, the Holy Lord saw the layer of faint golden-red light covering the young man's body. It was like a shining golden-red jade. It was crystal clear and without any flaws.</p>

    <p>The sign of the sanctification of the physical body is that the physical body and the bones in the body can be transformed into a light golden color. This is what Buddhism calls "the indestructible diamond."</p>

    <p>Usually, the higher the intensity, the thicker the golden color.</p>

    <p>However, the golden-red holy body was something he had never seen before... a crystal clear golden-red color. Only the most powerful ones who have become saints in the physical body can cultivate this kind of holy body that has even the bone marrow and blood vessels tempered to perfection. !</p>

    <p>This person...</p>

    <p>What exactly is it?</p>
