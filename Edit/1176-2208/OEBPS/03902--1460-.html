  <h1>Chapter 1460 If it doesn't work well, it will become an urban legend.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Take transportation together...</p>

    <p>There are actually great potential risks during this period.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling took the Spirit Bus here before. But that was because the Wang Family Villa was relatively remote. There was basically no one there when we got on the bus.</p>

    <p>Plus, he got up very early, so there was no need to worry about crowding in on others.</p>

    <p>Then the problem of breaking other people's bones.</p>

    <p>Just apply a {Great Light Body Technique} to yourself before getting in the car.</p>

    <p>This is a spell that can help you lose weight quickly. After all, his body is too dense. He even destroyed the newly renovated teleportation array at Number 60 High School before.</p>

    <p>That's because now his combat power seems to be much improved than before...</p>

    <p>One shot of {Great Light Body Technique} is no longer enough. Multiple consecutive shots to the body are necessary.</p>

    <p>So to sum up the above.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong's concerns are actually very reasonable...</p>

    <p>When people are crowded, it is indeed easy to cause various embarrassments and risks.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, there are more scumbags nowadays. It is really not safe for girls to be squeezed.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling is worried about is that after he gets on the bus, a group of people will crowd in on him.</p>

    <p>When we got off the bus, those people broke their bones again...</p>

    <p>Then it may trigger a series of butterfly effects later on, such as traffic crashes and other possible situations.</p>

    <p>Maybe this matter will attract widespread attention.</p>

    <p>On a crowded bus. All the passengers were in good health when they got on the bus. They all had broken bones when they got off...</p>

    <p>This will definitely become an "urban legend!"</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that it seems that he is not the only one with problems now.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong is also very dangerous to other people...</p>

    <p>After the girl's passive version "human sword merges into one", her combat power is greatly improved.</p>

    <p>It is the strongest Foundation Building on earth. It is also the most dangerous Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>It is the instinct of the spirit sword to protect the sword master. In other words, if there is really a dirty trick on the bus...Aohai's sword energy will be directly released to protect Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This is the passive version of the "savior mechanism."</p>

    <p>I wonder how many people in this bus will be alive after this sword energy subsides...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it's not just as simple as in the bus. It will be serious within a few dozen miles.</p>

    <p>Aohai's current sword energy is so terrifying.</p>

    <p>And for those potential losers.</p>

    <p>Of course they would not have thought that a girl in the Foundation Building stage could bring such devastating damage.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling. Sometimes life is so bitter.</p>

    <p>But there's nothing he can do. He's used to it.</p>

    <p>Life can't always be perfect. It's normal to have ups and downs. The most important thing is to learn to adapt and enjoy.</p>

    <p>Maybe. When can the "Talisman" matter be solved? Or find other ways to control the energy of his body's unlimited growth.</p>

    <p>Until then, maybe he can truly enjoy life.</p>

    <p>For a time, Wang Ling and Sun Rong had a lot of thoughts in their minds.</p>

    <p>But obviously, now is not the time to feel melancholy.</p>

    <p>"I've thought about it. In fact, we don't necessarily have to take transportation."</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong was the first to speak. She was still thinking about Wang Ling's point of view, "Originally I thought. Sword defense is fine. But there is a ban on Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. The fine is not a big deal. The main thing is that it will delay a lot of time."</p>

    <p>"so?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. He looked at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling...How about we teleport there?"</p>

    <p>I have to say. Sun Rong's proposal has been brought to the point!</p>

    <p>Because this is the same idea as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there is no one in front of Number 60 High School now. It is easy to go to a remote place and teleport.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that Li Youyue, Chen Chao, and Guo Hao are not here.</p>

    <p>It is a matter of course to activate the ability.</p>

    <p>Just do it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, at the intersection of Xiuzhen Ancient Street, Li Youyue, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were sitting on a bench in the square at the intersection of the ancient street, quite bored.</p>

    <p>Under the shade of the tree, Chen Chao always had an ominous premonition, "Speaking of which, is this really okay for us?"</p>

    <p>"It's all about creating opportunities for Boss Sun. What's wrong with that?" Guo Hao started playing mobile games with his phone in hand. He didn't have any free time.</p>

    <p>Holding the number one account in the entire server. This feeling of being a boss is very pleasant.</p>

    <p>"It's better to be a boss yourself than to have a boss around you. Wouldn't it be better to hug the boss's lap?" Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Boss Sun Rong is our boss now. How much pocket money does she have per month? I think it should be around one million at least?" This is the combination of Guo Hao and Sun RongThe result of extrapolating the benefits to them.</p>

    <p>With the wealth of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, a million-level pocket money is actually not excessive.</p>

    <p>"envy!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao sighed, "What a pity. In the end, it was cheaper Wang Ling. If your son really marries Sun Rong in the future, wouldn't he become a rich man?"</p>

    <p>"Don't think too much. You may not be able to reach this step."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was actually a little worried.</p>

    <p>Like, fall in love, get married...</p>

    <p>These are three different things!</p>

    <p>If you break it down further.</p>

    <p>Liking can be divided into active and passive. That is, liking. and being liked.</p>

    <p>To be liked. That is, to have a crush...</p>

    <p>It took a whole semester. It took a lot of effort to develop from a secret love to a clear love.</p>

    <p>But the problem is.</p>

    <p>These two still made no progress at all.</p>

    <p>As a best friend, Li Youyue also felt melancholy in her heart.</p>

    <p>So the main problem actually lies in that piece of wood...</p>

    <p>"In my experience, classmate Wang Ling is actually the type of person who is not easy to deal with. So it is actually very important to create more opportunities for them."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue said, "It's good to be able to confirm the relationship before graduation. I think... maybe it won't be confirmed even after graduation. Rongrong may have to pursue it in college. It will take a long time to work hard. Only then can there be hope."</p>

    <p>"But how can anyone persist for that long?" At this time, Guo Hao stopped what he was doing and looked at Li Youyue.</p>

    <p>After all, there have been news on the Internet before that some celebrities met, fell in love, and then got married. They claimed that it was a destined love, a romance that lasted for ten years... but in the end they separated not long after they got together.</p>

    <p>Emotional matters are very complicated. Even leaving aside the factors of Sun Rong's family background.</p>

    <p>It's rare for a girl to invest so much time in a boy.</p>

    <p>Actually, is it a boy or a girl.</p>

    <p>After chasing for a long time without seeing any results, you will always give up because of despair, right?</p>

    <p>"I don't know how long Rongrong can hold on. Anyway, I will definitely not hang myself on a boy... Even if I meet someone I really like, it will only take a year or two to chase him. If there is no result, it means it is still It's a relationship that is not destined to happen." Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>"One or two years?" Guo Hao and Chen Chao were surprised.</p>

    <p>This time is actually very long for girls.</p>

    <p>But after all, this is an era of universal cultivation. Female cultivators do not have to worry about their appearance aging due to age.</p>

    <p>After all, there are so many ways to stay beautiful nowadays.</p>

    <p>If you really find someone you like, it doesn't matter if you spend a year or two chasing her.</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, a familiar voice came from behind the three of them.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior?"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was instantly surprised, "Why is the senior here?"</p>

    <p>"It's business." Zhuo Yi said with a mysterious smile, "I will go in first later. You three, just pretend you have never seen me. Understood?"</p>

    <p>"Okay! Zhuo Yi Senior!" the three of them said in unison.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. Be good!" Zhuo Yi walked over with a smile on his face and gently patted Li Youyue on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>The action itself actually has no meaning.</p>

    <p>It's like a habitual greeting between brothers and sisters.</p>

    <p>However, what Zhuo Yi doesn't know is.</p>

    <p>This action caused the air temperature on the other side of the square to drop suddenly by several points.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi. Wearing a black cloak and sitting under the bench on the other side.</p>

    <p>I just happened to see this scene between Zhuo Yi and Li Youyue...</p>
