  <h1>Chapter 1406 1 piece of grass</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Thank you." Leng Ming replied politely.</p>

    <p>He had a smile on his face. But he seemed nervous.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. Behave well. Just wait behind the yellow-haired brother in front." Xiao Qian said softly while taking notes. Then she gave the number plate to Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Carter and Xiao Qian are both very patient. After all, they are newborn sword spirits. As seniors, they always have to take more care of them.</p>

    <p>And the key thing is that the child in front of me looks lovely. He is a cute little guy.</p>

    <p>Although they were not optimistic about Leng Ming's final test results, Leng Ming entered the sword list not long after he was born. Leng Ming is definitely someone worth looking forward to in the future.</p>

    <p>Transformed by a piece of grass?</p>

    <p>A bit interesting...</p>

    <p>Carter and Xiao Qian both waited for Leng Ming to appear with expectant looks.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Carter was also thinking about it.</p>

    <p>Transformed into a piece of grass... what kind of grass is it? It can be awakened in this form. Could it be that it was accidentally peed on by Ling Zhenren?</p>

    <p>At this time, in Jian Shen Square, many sword spirits were talking about Leng Ming's appearance.</p>

    <p>They originally thought this was the child of some great Sword Spirit family. But they didn't expect that this child was independently conceived by the Sword King Realm. And he even came to sign up.</p>

    <p>"I was ranked at the bottom of the sword list when I was born. I'm lucky. I don't know how much combat power I can produce."</p>

    <p>"The sword monument was erected by Dao Ancestor Wang himself. It can test a person's combat power, talent and potential from all aspects. Therefore, the combat power in the comprehensive score is only counted as part of it. The ranking of the sword list is also based on combat power. Ranking. Relatively speaking, the comprehensive evaluation of the sword monument will be more objective."</p>

    <p>A sword spirit looked at the huge sword monument in front of him and said.</p>

    <p>This sword monument is a thousand feet high, but the whole thing is broken.</p>

    <p>And such a break has only happened once in the history of Jian Bang.</p>

    <p>That was when Jingke was first born.</p>

    <p>As soon as Jingke was born, he cut off half of the sword stele with a sword. A large piece of the originally two thousand-foot sword stele was cut off alive and divided by the sword energy. It turned into powder on the spot.</p>

    <p>Back then, Jingke was invincible. He was number one in terms of combat power, talent and potential.</p>

    <p>It shocked the entire sword king world.</p>

    <p>But a miracle like that probably won't happen again.</p>

    <p>The sword list is ranked based on combat power. Leng Ming's combat power value will not be too high. This is already a certainty.</p>

    <p>The miracle of the broken sword tablet will never happen again.</p>

    <p>So the key now is how his talent and potential are.</p>

    <p>At this moment, everyone in the square is watching.</p>

    <p>There is a sword monument standing in front of you. All kinds of sword spirits are watching around. Some are queuing up, and some are coming over to watch the excitement after hearing the news.</p>

    <p>Most sword spirits are in human form, with different body shapes. There are also animal-shaped sword spirits.</p>

    <p>After Leng Ming got the number, he confirmed that he was behind a yellow-haired young man. The young man glanced at Leng Ming with disdain: "Little Sword Spirit, let's see my brother perform for you!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he walked towards the sword monument. His whole body was emitting electric light. The powerful sword energy was released from his body!</p>

    <p>"I remember him! His name! Dian Ming! Dian Ming of One Hundred Thousand Volts!"</p>

    <p>"So it's him...I remember him!"</p>

    <p>Many sword spirits began to whisper and discuss among themselves.</p>

    <p>The moment they saw the lightning burst out, they realized that the yellow-haired man was "Dian Ming." The young man's lightning was his true identity!</p>

    <p>Today, Dian Ming ranks 286th in the combat power rankings! He is one of the masters in the King Group!</p>

    <p>He has the habit of reading. In the world of sword kings, there are also many small sword spirits who sell their words to earn royalties in order to upgrade their swords, and then buy upgrading materials.</p>

    <p>In order to push for updates, Dian Ming often goes up to shock those unscrupulous delayers, interrupting the authors...</p>

    <p>Hence it has such a frightening reputation.</p>

    <p>Dian Ming was very confident in his test results. He unleashed his sword energy and slashed forward!</p>

    <p>Boom! Just for a moment. Golden lightning flashed everywhere. The sound of lightning and thunder boomed.</p>

    <p>The surging sword energy rushed forward and turned into a thunder tiger that rushed towards the sword monument! Then, a whole thunder tiger transformed from the lightning sword energy merged into the sword monument. It quickly disappeared into it and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Dian Ming is very confident in this attack of his. It has exhausted all his efforts. He believes that the result will not be too bad. At least there will be no problem in being selected 200 out of the 20,000 people in the king group.</p>

    <p>As long as his comprehensive score is ranked higher, it will be stable.</p>

    <p>"How's it going, little brother? How about that move that brother just made?" Dian Ming finished the test and glanced at Leng Ming beside him. He showed a proud smile.</p>

    <p>And soon. A string of ancient characters appeared on the sword tablet.</p>

    <p>Carter glanced at it and registered while reporting the results: "Dian Ming. Sword Qi 216. Total value: 21600. Passed. Current ranking in the King Group: 162nd."</p>

    <p>This result can be said to be not unexpected.</p>

    <p>With Dian Ming's level, the probability of being selected is extremely high. After all, the evaluation of the sword monument does not just rely solely on combat power data.</p>

    <p>However, Dian Ming is still a little dissatisfied with the current ranking. Baidu Novel</p>

    <p>He thought he could rank at least 120th.</p>

    <p>But now it seems... This Sword Tablet is a little bit behind. Because there are many other King's Group Sword Spirits who have not participated in the test. If he meets the masters later on. He'll definitely lose.</p>

    <p>However, even so, in Dian Ming's opinion, at least he is not considered a jerk in the eyes of others.</p>

    <p>Especially in front of this little sword spirit...</p>

    <p>"Little brother, it's your turn."</p>

    <p>Dian Ming glanced at Leng Ming, who was stunned beside him, and then stood aside.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming stepped forward. He faced the sword monument. His face was red from holding back the sword. Finally, he punched it with his small fist.</p>

    <p>The sword monument showed no response...</p>

    <p>The whole audience roared with laughter.</p>

    <p>"Little brother, you are useless! You have to do the same as the elder brother before and use your own sword energy to slash at the sword monument!" A kind person reminded me.</p>

    <p>Carter held her forehead and patiently stepped forward. She pressed the lower part of Leng Ming's navel and said, "You have to get lucky from here. You know? When the sword energy comes up, release it from your fingers."</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's face was red. He was anxious and shy. He didn't expect that he would make a fool of himself as soon as he appeared on the stage.</p>

    <p>He calmed down, and then followed Carter's instructions. Finally, a fluorescent green sword energy like a small flame was born in his palm...</p>

    <p>"Is this sword energy... really capable of fighting?" Many people stared at the scene in front of them, dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Such a weak sword spirit. Maybe it can only be used to light a cigarette?</p>

    <p>Sure enough, in terms of combat power alone, Leng Ming still can't do it.</p>

    <p>At this time, the boy carefully protected the small amount of sword energy he had nurtured.</p>

    <p>The trace of fluorescent green sword energy had just touched the sword monument, and instantly disappeared into it.</p>

    <p>Sword Monument. Still no trouble.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Many people were originally looking forward to Leng Ming's performance. However, it seems that Leng Ming is a bit disappointing now.</p>

    <p>"As expected, it still doesn't work?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. What can the newly born little sword spirit do? It's just good luck to be at the bottom of the sword list."</p>

    <p>However, just a few seconds after these people finished speaking.</p>

    <p>The entire sword monument actually began to tremble violently!</p>

    <p>In an instant, a golden light burst out from the sword monument. It was so bright that it resonated with the entire Sword King Realm. The sword energy that was originally like a spark of fire formed a sword pressure like a prairie fire at this moment, covering the entire Jian Shen Square. submerged.</p>

    <p>Such a vision shocked the whole audience...</p>

    <p>"What happened?"</p>

    <p>Almost all the sword spirits in the Sword King Realm, regardless of whether they were in Jian Shen Square or not, raised their heads and looked up at the sky, sensing the power conveyed by the sword monument.</p>

    <p>When the sword spirits in Jian Shen Square saw the values displayed on the sword tablet, they all showed shocked expressions.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! A hundred thousand values!"</p>

    <p>"First place in the bronze category!"</p>

    <p>"It's not just the Bronze Group! With this kind of value, it's also invincible in the King Group!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Very good. Yes."</p>

    <p>At this time on earth, in the Wang family's villa, Jingke felt the strong fluctuations coming from Jian Shen Square.</p>

    <p>It's a good seedling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He felt it too.</p>

    <p>There are now many sword spirits gathered in Jian Shen Square. It has aroused the curiosity of Wang Ling a long time ago.</p>

    <p>So he familiarly started the "God's Perspective" work of peeping.</p>

    <p>"Anyway. How much did you hit back then?" At this moment. Er Ha looked at Jingke curiously.</p>

    <p>"Not much."</p>

    <p>Jingke shook his head. Modestly, he said, "Only. One billion points."</p>

    <p>"One billion... And you broke the sword tablet?" Er Ha's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"Just. Just a stroke."</p>

    <p>Jingke said: "I didn't expect it to be so big."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
