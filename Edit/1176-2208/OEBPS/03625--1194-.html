  <h1>Chapter 1194 White Hair's true identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone here is struggling to choose a topic. On the other side, Wang Ling has arrived at the coordinate location.</p>

    <p>Sun.</p>

    <p>As a huge and hot gas planet in the universe, it has continued to glow and heat for about 4.5 billion years. The surface temperature is nearly 6,000 degrees. The core temperature is as high as 15 million degrees.</p>

    <p>The surface cell structure photographed by the most advanced telescope on earth shows that the cell structure of each solar surface is approximately the size of a country.</p>

    <p>Of course. True Immortal cultivators on Earth cannot approach this place.</p>

    <p>Their activity time in the universe can only last less than five minutes.</p>

    <p>Unless it can reach Venerated Immortal status.</p>

    <p>Because Venerated Immortal can unlock the second origin. By absorbing the "original energy" emitted from the universe, it can be used as a long-term energy supply.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that Zhenyuan Immortal wandered around the universe for nearly a thousand years before he found the "Drought Star" suitable for human beings to remember.</p>

    <p>However, even if it reaches the level of Venerated Immortal, it is still unable to approach some specific celestial objects. It has to take a detour during the cosmic walk.</p>

    <p>For example, a star with a blazing temperature like the sun. Another example is a black hole that can swallow even light...</p>

    <p>Eh...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Not affected by the above restrictions.</p>

    <p>He is a man who can directly approach the sun and black holes.</p>

    <p>One thing that Wang Ling needs to pay attention to is that the clothes on your body must be modified before taking action so that the clothes have a certain ability to withstand pressure.</p>

    <p>Although his body can withstand it, his clothes may not be able to withstand such torture.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling was a child, he remembered that after he was so close to the sun because he didn't light up his clothes, all the clothes on his body were burned by the sun.</p>

    <p>This matter is a secret buried deep in Wang Ling's heart.</p>

    <p>Looking at the entire universe, probably only the sun knows about it.</p>

    <p>All things have animism, and the sun is no exception.</p>

    <p>It's just that the spirit of the sun is in a state of slumber all year round...</p>

    <p>The last time it woke up, it saw a naked child dangling in front of its eyes. It was so shocked that its surface temperature increased by several hundred degrees.</p>

    <p>Now, this familiar aura is approaching again, causing the Sun Spirit to tremble all over and wake up from its long sleep again.</p>

    <p>You can't go wrong...</p>

    <p>This aura is that of the child whose clothes were burned by him back then but whose body was still intact.</p>

    <p>But when it was sleeping with its eyes closed, he didn't expect Wang Ling to have grown so big.</p>

    <p>But soon Sun Spirit realized something was wrong...</p>

    <p>It found that Wang Ling did not seem to be directed at itself.</p>

    <p>Because just behind it, the Sun Spirit discovered the figure of another boy with white hair. And the boy's appearance was exactly the same as Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"?" Sun Spirit felt a little confused.</p>

    <p>The situation has completely developed into an unexpected situation...</p>

    <p>As a proud Sun Spirit, no human being has ever been able to survive the heat of his core intact. But since meeting Wang Ling, the Sun Spirit found himself in a state of complete autistic isolation.</p>

    <p>And now, its autism has not been completely lifted. As a result, another one has come...</p>

    <p>Judging from the auras emanating from the two of them, a fierce battle is probably inevitable.</p>

    <p>Behind the sun. The boy with white hair who looks exactly like Wang Ling is surrounded by a dark halo of light. He rises from the surface ignoring the blazing temperature of the sun.</p>

    <p>Just having a face-to-face encounter with Wang Ling, Wang Ling had already made a judgment on the outcome of this duel.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why the boy in front of me looks exactly like myself. But after such close contact, Wang Ling feels that the other person is not my opponent.</p>

    <p>"Don't be too proud. Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>The white-haired boy sighed: "I know. It's difficult for me to defeat you with my current fighting power. But..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the white-haired boy turned his peripheral vision to the huge black pillar on the back of the sun. From a distance, it looked like this huge black pillar was like a needle piercing the surface of the golden sun.</p>

    <p>This is the magic weapon that the White Hair boy has been preparing for a long time. The all-encompassing pillar! Ignores the temperature. It can directly penetrate into the most blazing core of the sun!</p>

    <p>At this time, the Sun Spirit finally understood the White Hair boy's intention...</p>

    <p>The other party wants to extract the power of its "Spirit of the Sun" to resonate with the other eight planets in the solar system. When the last main valve of the heavenly veins on the earth is opened, the cosmic formation array surrounding the solar system will be activated! At that time, all living things in the entire solar system will be swallowed up by this White Hair!</p>

    <p>"If I gather the power of the entire solar system... Wang Ling, do you think you are still my opponent?" As he spoke, White Hair glanced in the direction of the Sun Luo Vientiane Pillar. He painstakingly planned to target the Sun. The spirit absorption ritual has been initiated.</p>

    <p>Although he thinks that he is not Wang Ling's opponent at the moment. But as long as he can delay it until the Senluo Wanxiang Pillar absorbs the energy of the Sun Spirit!</p>

    <p>No need to fully absorb!</p>

    <p>10% is enough to cooperate with the Heavenly Meridian Master Valve on the earth's side. Start the cosmic refining array!</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling looked around the Senluo Wanxiang Pillar. He saw that the surface of the sun was like a man with thick hair who suddenly had his scalp cut off. The surface that should have been extremely blazing turned out to be bare. The temperature above dropped sharply. There was even a layer of frost...</p>

    <p>This is obviously the work of White Hair. Even Wang Ling himself did not expect that other than himself, there would be someone so "unbridled" with the Sun Spirit.</p>

    <p>There was no way he was going to let White Hair succeed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling leans over and rushes towards the Universal Pillar. The top priority right now is to prevent the opponent from absorbing the spirit of the sun. It is best to directly pull out or destroy this pillar!</p>

    <p>But using magic to destroy it. Wang Ling was worried that this would also cause irreversible damage to the surface of the sun. So after thinking about it comprehensively, Wang Ling thought it would be better to just pull it out. The damage to the sun and the sun spirit would be minimal. of.</p>

    <p>However, to Wang Ling's surprise, White Hair's movements and reactions were as fast as his. The moment he took action, the opponent's speed was no less than his!</p>

    <p>It's almost synchronicity!</p>

    <p>This surprised Wang Ling, because no one could keep up with his actions given his seriousness.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Only I can catch up with you in this world." White Hair said. He said calmly. His face was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>Is it completely consistent with me?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking in his mind. He has been guessing the identity of White Hair.</p>

    <p>Initially, Wang Ling's suspicion was that White Hair might be a character that jumped out of "Fate." From another world.</p>

    <p>But now Wang Ling has a new idea in mind.</p>

    <p>And the answer to this assumption is many times more complicated than the version previously imagined by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Wang Ling did not hesitate. He raised his hand and cast a thirteenth level spell.</p>

    <p>This move is called Galaxy Explosion. It can gather all nearby meteorites to launch a dense bombardment like a meteor shower...</p>

    <p>However, the moment Wang Ling raised his hand to cast a spell, the White Hair on the opposite side repeated his actions as if looking into a mirror. He cast the exact same spell!</p>

    <p>They raised their hands at the same time, made seals at the same time, and cast spells at the same time.</p>

    <p>All times are accurate to microseconds. Almost accurate!</p>

    <p>Even the strongest copy cultivator on earth may not be able to do this!</p>

    <p>But precisely because of this. Wang Ling further supports his inference.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid there is only one answer.</p>

    <p>The one in front of me is White Hair.</p>

    <p>It is the incarnation of one's own shadow.</p>
