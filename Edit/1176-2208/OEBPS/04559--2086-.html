  <h1>Chapter 2086 Something that shocked Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Zhang Zhui looked calm and composed. His eyes were as bright as a torch. He glanced at the forcibly evolved monster below.</p>

    <p>After reshaping his face, the arrogant and domineering spirit from the Eternal Period appeared at the same time, making his entire person's domineering appearance appear.</p>

    <p>Although the name Eternal Thief seems unpalatable in modern times, in the Eternal Era, Zhang Zhui was also a well-known missionary.</p>

    <p>The Eternal Ones are beyond the earth. They are the earliest batch of human monks. Their realm is far beyond the current understanding of the earth.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui knew that what happened to him would probably scare the sword master. But the current situation was critical and he had to take action. As for the explanation...</p>

    <p>Then we can only wait until later to find a way to round it off.</p>

    <p>He tore off the fins of the King Shark with his hands. This scene still shocked everyone here.</p>

    <p>Who could have imagined that a monster that even monks in the Holy Realm find difficult to deal with. A monster that can completely explode its psychic energy by flipping its fins and blow up ships... is actually fragile in this man's hands. To the point where there is no room left to fight back.</p>

    <p>This is a monk who is beyond recognition. Especially under the strong contrast of this battle environment. How can everyone not be frightened?</p>

    <p>But what Zhang Zhui didn't expect was that the next second, the world-famous swordsman stood with his hands behind his hands. He looked at him calmly and asked through the message.</p>

    <p>"Are you. An Eternal?"</p>

    <p>He looked at Zhang Zhui. The sound was not loud, but it made Zhang Zhui feel like his scalp was numb.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan actually knows the Eternal One?</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was stunned. He never expected that Yi Jianchuan would know about the existence of the Eternal One.</p>

    <p>Including this moment, Wang Ling, who was secretly monitoring everything from a distance, was also stunned.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this is an unexpected situation that was completely unexpected. Wang Ling thought that the existence of the Eternal Ones was a secret matter. With the current level of the earth's monks, it is impossible to know that there are a group of living fossil-level characters.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that now the sword master would directly ask in an understatement. At least it proves that this matter has been rumored among high-level cultivators from various countries for a long time. And it is no longer a secret.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this matter is a big miscalculation on his part.</p>

    <p>After all, he is only a seventeen-year-old kid...</p>

    <p>The world of adults is far more complicated than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Take Huaxiu for example.</p>

    <p>It has a history of civilization of nearly five thousand years since the founding of the country. Among the cultivation countries in the world today, there is the oldest culture and civilization. It can maintain a historical civilization for such a long time. The wisdom from the ancestors is far beyond the reach of other people.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling judged. As for the Eternal One, as a confidant of Huaxiu Yuan Zun, the Sword Master knew about this matter. Then Mr. Yuan Zun must also have some understanding of the Eternal One.</p>

    <p>Maybe not as thoroughly as he knows. But he definitely knows that in the long history of human cultivation, there has been such a glorious history of eternal cultivation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling speculates that they can know the Eternal One. A large part of the reason may be those extraterrestrial meteorites.</p>

    <p>The history of the universe is too long. It is not surprising to find some possible results from the analysis of meteorites. Although the world of eternal cultivation is located in the infinite galaxy and is far away from the location of current earth civilization, it cannot be ruled out that meteorites from the eternal period have fallen. Possibility of landing on Earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling even felt that Huaxiu Yuan Zun might have been secretly observing some known Eternals.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling also knows that some of the Eternals do disguise themselves as normal monks and live on the current earth.</p>

    <p>It can be said that at this point, the showdown has been made openly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really feels that Zhang Zhui no longer needs to hide anything.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui originally thought that he could hide everything from the sword master, but he didn't expect that among all the monks here, he was the one who could see it most clearly.</p>

    <p>It was he who underestimated Yi Jianchuan. He also felt that Wang Ling's vision was indeed vicious. Such a person was indeed qualified to be Wang Muyu's teacher.</p>

    <p>If Yi Jianchuan lived in eternity and had the same Taoism as him, with the same Taoism, his realm would only be stronger than his own.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that the Sword Master is aware of our existence." After getting Wang Ling's permission, Zhang Zhui decided to show off directly.</p>

    <p>"Just a guess."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan said: "Except for Mr. Huaxiu Yuan Zun, no one has seen the Eternal One. Of course, I don't know if that person is the Eternal One. I am just observing."</p>

    <p>"Oh? I wonder if the Sword Master can tell me? Maybe it's someone I know."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui and Wang Ling were both curious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is in the ancestral land, but remotely directs Zhang Zhui's inquiry. He really wants to know who the Eternal One Huaxiu Yuan Zun has been secretly observing.</p>

    <p>"Maybe he is the Eternal One. Maybe... he is just an ordinary mortal. Master Yuan Zun has been observing this person for a long time. He is so detailed that you can't imagine. He even went to his house in person. He just treated it as a casual chat with a friend. But this person is really too cautious." When Yi Jianchuan said this, he couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" Zhang Zhui became even more curious.</p>

    <p>When he saw that the monster underneath showed signs of activity, he raised his hand and slapped it again. He slapped the Shark Emperor on the sea surface very roughly.</p>

    <p>When eating melon, the most annoying thing is someone interrupting me.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the sword master was hesitant, he quickly said: "Sword Master, don't worry. I'm not a bad person. If I were a bad person, I wouldn't be able to come to the rescue at this time. You should know that most of the Eternal Ones are hidden. Since what you have observed, That person has never shown any clues. This further proves that we are not in a critical moment and will not reveal our identity easily. To tell the truth, what does the death of these people have to do with me?"</p>

    <p>He said truthfully: "In the final analysis, it's because I saw that you, Sword Master, are a man with a fearless sword heart, so I decided to help you. I don't want a kind and righteous person like you to die at the hands of such a monster."</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Zhang Zhui is worthy of being Zhang Zhui. As the eternal King of the Sea, he does have some abilities of his own.</p>

    <p>This smooth talk was not fake. The sword master was immediately shocked when he heard it.</p>

    <p>If Zhang Zhui hadn't taken action, he really wouldn't have been able to deal with the monster in front of him.</p>

    <p>This is the truth.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan felt that he could not refute.</p>

    <p>So, after a moment of silence, he finally spoke to Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>But the person he was talking about was quite surprising.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It is also impossible for eight lifetimes to imagine who the Eternal One that Huaxiu Yuan Zun has been secretly monitoring...</p>

    <p>"This person's full name in the modern world of cultivation. www.uukanshu.net is: Wang Jiao."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Zhang Zhui: "???"</p>

    <p>"His identity now is that of an Internet expert. His pen name is: Wang Situ."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan thought for a moment and continued to tell more details about this "Hidden One."</p>

    <p>Hearing Wang Ling almost choked on his own saliva.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that this is indeed a pain in the balls that ordinary people cannot understand.</p>

    <p>But it happened that Wang Ling happened to...</p>

    <p>It turns out that Huaxiu Yuan Zun has been reading what his father wrote. I don't think the book is well written at all. It's because I think his father is the Eternal One...</p>

    <p>I have been observing him secretly!</p>
