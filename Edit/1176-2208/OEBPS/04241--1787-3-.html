  <h1>Chapter 1787 I couldn't think of the title so I had to continue using Meili's Death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Butler Lin knew nothing about Wang Ling and Wang Muyu's situation. It was quite normal to have such worries. Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart. He hoped that those people would come to trouble him. Because Then he can witness who is causing trouble for whom.</p>

    <p>Compared with these. Wang Ling found that he cared more about Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why, but he always felt that this little guy who had caused him a lot of trouble before had a particularly magical affinity. Although the little guy is strong, he is not experienced in the world. Bai Zhe used remote control to scare this little guy badly.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu, who combines Dragon genes, has unlimited potential for subsequent development. However, the strong will return to the strong. Wang Ling knows that Wang Muyu is not fully developed...</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe, on the other hand, obviously wants to use the powerful ability of his Moonlight Dragon form to create a time gap and take advantage of this period of time to snatch the little guy back into his hands.</p>

    <p>It's just that this little one is so close to him now. It's probably not that simple to snatch him back.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling had many thoughts in his mind. To be honest, he didn't know how it would develop in the future. He could only wait and see.</p>

    <p>"It's hard for everyone to come out. I don't think Uncle Lin should worry too much. These people just want to restrict us to being trapped in Mixiu Country. And then use it as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shuilian Group. What kind of threat does it pose to us?" At this time, Sun Rong said: "It's hard for everyone to come out. It's too boring to stay in the hotel."</p>

    <p>"Miss, they are focused on you and may not do anything to you...but the others..."</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin, it's okay. In fact, my master also followed here secretly. She will protect everyone's safety at all times."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling understood.</p>

    <p>All actions in Glio City now. This "Wang Piaoliang" fictionalized by Sun Rong has become the new scapegoat to take over from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Wang Ling thinks Sun Rong's move is quite good. And it seems to have a miraculous effect. It caused those people who lurked behind the Tengu to have further reactions in the form of Haiyao Jushi's.</p>

    <p>In the Office of Strategic Deception. There are indeed eternal beings.</p>

    <p>However, the only Eternals released by Wang Ling so far are Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>The rest of the Eternals, numbering in the tens of thousands, are all locked up in the Corpse Map held by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If all these Eternals were summoned, such an army of Eternals would be enough to conquer any corner of the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Therefore Wang Ling has always been suspicious.</p>

    <p>Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang found all kinds of weird excuses to use this Supreme Corpse Map to suppress the Eternal Ones. He collected these Eternal Ones. In addition to protecting these Eternal Ones, it also had the purpose of preparing for war?</p>

    <p>However, these are just wishful guesses by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, Butler Lin's greeting interrupted Wang Ling's wandering thoughts: "Okay. Mr. Wang Ling, and all the students here. If you want to go out, please don't be alone. Go out. It's best to have each other look out for."</p>

    <p>"In addition, don't go too far and remote places. It should be safer to go shopping in crowded shopping malls. Although the power in Glio City is complicated, they don't dare to do anything blatantly in broad daylight. Everyone understands ?"</p>

    <p>"Okay Uncle Lin!"</p>

    <p>The rest of the people imitated Sun Rong and shouted.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next day. Sunday morning, January 4th.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that the news of Sun Rong's detention had spread on the Internet, and the detention operation led by St. Peter's Church had created a new chemical reaction.</p>

    <p>It was announced by the Mixiu Country government that relevant personnel of the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shuilian Group will be restricted from entering Mixiu Country. Physical sanctions will be imposed on the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>This move is to limit the Office of Strategic Deception from sending reinforcements. It directly cuts off the back-up route.</p>

    <p>So this early in the morning, Zhuo Yi, who originally wanted to go to Glio City, was stuck at the entry and exit gate.</p>

    <p>After returning to the car, the expression on Zhuo Yi's face was very worried.</p>

    <p>Because this game is no longer simply between sects. It is a game between cultivators.</p>

    <p>Any retreat by either party will make the other party push further. Even Zhuo Yi cannot see how the subsequent situation will end.</p>

    <p>"Master, how is the situation?" Zhou Ziyi asked in the car.</p>

    <p>"I have been restricted from leaving the country. Not only that. Many people in the Office of Strategic Deception are restricted from leaving the country." Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel. He said with a headache: "I haven't figured out what to do yet..."</p>

    <p>"What instructions do you have from Master?"</p>

    <p>"There are no new instructions yet. After all, it's a matter of safety. Don't think too much about it. There will definitely be no problem with Master and Mistress. The latest chat record with Master was last night."</p>

    <p>"Ah? What did Master say?"</p>

    <p>"He said he hopes to resolve this matter as soon as possible so that he can return to Huaxiu as soon as possible to take the monthly exam."</p>

    <p>"So much love for learning, worthy of the Master..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Zhuo Yi also couldn't help but smile: "But it's not that easy. The city of Glio is too complicated, with all the mafia, mercenary groups, and various religious sects, and the most troublesome part of this operation is the involvement of the local church."</p>

    <p>"I heard Rongrong talk about this. The top priority now is to help Rongrong and others clear their suspicions."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi, who was sitting aside, said: "The one who restricted the charge of hiring a murderer against Rongrong was the mafia organization called Chilan Society. So the key is to start with that mafia organization."</p>

    <p>The girl said this. Zhuo Yi's eyes suddenly lit up: "By the way Liangzi... I remember your sixth lady..."</p>

    <p>"I was just about to tell you about this. Our family also has some connections in the mafia because of the Sixth Madam." Jiugong Liangzi said: "I may be able to help them by sending me abroad. I'm not in the system. The layoff list is available. I can go out normally."</p>

    <p>"No. It's too dangerous." Zhuo Yi's first reaction was to refuse.</p>

    <p>He really couldn't bear to let Jiugong Liangzi out like that...</p>

    <p>"With Wang Ling and Rongrong here, I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "The top priority now is to get Rongrong and the others back. If you can't get out, if you are worried, can you find someone to go out with me. For example, senior Jin Deng, senior Li Xian and senior Zhang Zhui?"</p>

    <p>"None of these three. They have been registered on the official website of the Office of Strategic Deception. This time they are also on the list."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head and said: "It's really not possible. I have to ask senior Qin Zhong and senior Xiang Yi to go with you. They haven't had time to register yet... It should be no problem to get in with you. Besides, you need to help them arrange a cover for their identities."</p>

    <p>"This is easy. I'll arrange it right away." Jiugong Liangzi nodded.</p>

    <p>She was about to take out her mobile phone to contact related matters. Then she saw Zhuo Yi slowly reaching out. An emerald green bamboo sword suddenly caught Jiugong Liangzi's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. I will lend you Yu. Glio City is very complicated... If you are alone, you can defend yourself with Yu..."</p>
