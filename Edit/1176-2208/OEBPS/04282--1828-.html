  <h1>Chapter 1828 What should I do if my lady falls in love with nuclear bombs?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone's color changed. They all gasped. This comet-sized punch was met head-on with only his small flesh fist like a drill. It was completely defeated in an instant.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is too ferocious. Such power is immeasurable. The power of the punch just now was conservatively estimated to have exceeded 1,000 nuclear cores!</p>

    <p>"Nuclear core. What is that?"</p>

    <p>After hearing this concept, Chen Chao and others were puzzled. They asked the others: "Is it a unit of measurement for combat power?"</p>

    <p>"This is a unit of measurement of combat power that can only be achieved after reaching a state that you can't imagine. The power of 1 nuclear core can easily destroy a planet as big as the earth. And kill everyone under the ancestral realm... "At this time. Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>"Damn it! That punch Wang Ling just had 1,000 cores?"</p>

    <p>"Well. And this is not all the strength of classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Pervert! Why are there such perverted guys living around me!" Chen Chao couldn't help but cursed. Even so, Sun Rong could still clearly feel the overflowing excitement of Chen Chao and others.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Chen Chao suddenly discovered a blind spot while being excited: "Eh? Why do you know so much, Boss Sun?"</p>

    <p>Even Butler Lin, who was standing nearby, was confused about this issue. He and his friends were completely stunned. They had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>But at least this time Wang Ling's showdown made Butler Lin suddenly understand a little bit. Why his young lady is so interested in this ordinary earthly boy...</p>

    <p>It's a pity that there is no mobile phone signal at all in the world of heavens. Otherwise, he would definitely ask a question on Bihu - What should I do if my young lady falls in love with a nuclear bomb? It's quite urgent.</p>

    <p>"That... was actually told to me by classmate Wang Ling just now!" In desperation, Sun Rong could only withdraw in a panic. Her face was red. Anyone could feel it. Sun Rong had an uncomfortable expression on his face.</p>

    <p>But in this case, everyone was attracted by the magnificent battle scene in front of them. No one would check whether Sun Rong's words were true or false.</p>

    <p>Normally, Chen Chao would definitely be able to tell something was wrong immediately.</p>

    <p>The message?</p>

    <p>Why are you the only one transmitting the message?</p>

    <p>When did your relationship become so good?</p>

    <p>But now, like everyone else, all his thoughts are focused on the battle in front of him. At the same time, he is also working hard to use his limited knowledge of cultivation to refresh his subverted view of cultivation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's punch can be called a flesh-bomb impact. It hit him fiercely. Golden light surged all over his body. It was like "Captain Marvel" in the science fiction movie.</p>

    <p>A long golden light trailed from his body. At the same time, it was mixed with different energies from all over the universe, such as the original Qi, Chaos Device, and Spiritual Qi. Finally, it converged into the mixed immortal Qi. He raised his momentum to the extreme, displaying unparalleled combat capabilities.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Wang Ling is standing at the top of human cultivators at this time. He possesses supreme spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Like the chosen one who has emerged from eternity. Completely crushing him from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Fearless. Unparalleled.</p>

    <p>The hybrid ancient god's recovery speed was extremely fast. The moment his entire right arm was split into hundreds of millions of fragments by Wang Ling's punch. With the surge of spiritual energy, these broken fragments quickly merged and condensed into a whole.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu looked solemn. He was a saint and one of the six guardians of the saint clan. Although he was ranked sixth in seniority, he also had the experience of insight into eternity.</p>

    <p>The young man from Earth in front of him was really weird. It was something he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>He is obviously not an Eternal One, but his momentum crushes all. He has reached such an astonishing level with just his physical body. Not only does he possess the most powerful world in existence, but he is not weak at all even in front of his hybrid ancient gods.</p>

    <p>So who is this monster?</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu looked solemn. He quickly formed seals. A familiar and terrifying aura broke out. It penetrated into the entire world of the heavens. A huge palace rising from the ground was formed. The whole body was filled with darkness. Color. It is densely covered with weird runes. And the entire palace hangs upside down. It looks like an illusory ghost palace. It is incompatible with the golden buildings in the Heavenly City in the entire world of the heavens.</p>

    <p>"The Palace of the Outer Gods..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>He had been thinking about why this Gui Laoliu was able to move around freely with his fists here despite the pressure of his own world.</p>

    <p>It turns out that there is a palace of outer gods supporting him behind our back.</p>

    <p>And there is more than one palace of the outer gods...</p>

    <p>These palaces of outer gods are like a virus invasion. They are directly connected together. They rise from the ground with an upside-down perspective in the world of heavens.</p>

    <p>The forces are like canine teeth intersecting, forming two clearly defined realms of darkness and light.</p>

    <p>Now even Sun Rong, who knew a lot of things, was shocked. She knew about the Palace of Outer Gods, but she never thought that after Wang Ling destroyed an Outer God Palace, there would still be people there. So many palaces of outer gods can be summoned!</p>

    <p>Although these palaces are not as majestic as the first sight, the key point is that they are numerous and have a strong sense of intimidation. More importantly, these palaces of the outer gods gathered together form an obvious confrontation in this world. Zheng is challenged by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This mixed-race race is too scary..." Sun Rong sighed inwardly. She never expected that the Holy Race, as a mixed-race race, could actually utilize the blood of the Old Dominator to such an extent.</p>

    <p>Not only can it control the remaining Cosmic Embryo. It can also control the palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>This is just a trump card owned by the Holy Lord. If it were the Holy King behind it, wouldn't it be even more arrogant?</p>

    <p>Obviously, these vast swathes of outer god palaces appeared in the world of the heavens. In Wang Ling's view, this was a kind of infiltration. Old Dominator has always been very aggressive. Therefore, when these outer god palaces appeared, he was also there. Think about the other person's intentions.</p>

    <p>Is this an attempt to infiltrate his heavenly world and then complete its annexation?</p>

    <p>Very good idea.</p>

    <p>At least in the eyes of Wang Ling. This is absolutely commendable.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Ling also felt sorry for Gui Laoliu's stupidity.</p>

    <p>Because it is obvious that at Gui Laoliu's level, he does not understand what kind of existence this world of heavens is. And why there are so many golden palaces with watchtowers and painted buildings in the world of heavens, forming such a large golden Heavenly city.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Every golden building in Heavenly City symbolizes a civilization that once disappeared in the time of the universe. Although their colors are the same, their styles are completely different. Different civilizations of different races. Now they are all represented like figures. Wang Ling Collect them one by one. Integrate them into his own heavenly world. Come together to form this Heavenly City.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling stared at the palaces of the outer gods summoned by Gui Laoliu. He couldn't help but reveal a rare and contemptuous smile.</p>

    <p>Since you gave it to me for free.</p>

    <p>Then I will.</p>

    <p>Received them all...</p>

    <p>He raised his hand. Then slowly closed his fingers...</p>
