  <h1>Chapter 1464 Without this chapter, there is no soul</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche remembered that he had seen such a crow pattern somewhere. It felt familiar at first sight.</p>

    <p>His mind quickly searched for his memories. In hesitation, he used his mobile phone to search the keyword "Jiugong" on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Then, the Jiugong family's huge and iconic purple-eyed crow family emblem was displayed on Jiang Xiaoche's mobile phone page.</p>

    <p>It was actually a pop-up advertisement! The Jiugong family crest filled half of the screen of Jiang Xiaoche's mobile phone. There was also an advertising slogan below: "Professional exorcism. A century-old brand."</p>

    <p>"It is indeed the Jiugong family's logo." Jiang Xiaoche stared at the phone and muttered to himself.</p>

    <p>What are the people from the Jiugong family doing in this ancient street...</p>

    <p>And he seemed to be eyeing Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche felt that there was something fishy going on here.</p>

    <p>After returning home yesterday, he reorganized the information about Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>As the girl said, she is indeed the granddaughter of Martial Saint Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche spent a long time reading Jiang Yingying's information carefully from beginning to end. He knew his height and body measurements clearly. It is still deeply remembered in his mind.</p>

    <p>He did not remember seeing any interaction between Jiang Yingying and the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>"It's better to observe first." Jiang Xiaoche frowned. He watched the Jiugong family following Jiang Yingying and Wei Zhi. They pretended to look at their mobile phones while walking, and silently followed behind the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Today's ancient street is indeed more lively than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>Except for their group. Zhuo Yi came here. It was requested by Wang Ling in advance.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi came here. Wang Ling was unexpected.</p>

    <p>Besides Jiugong Liangzi, there are also Jiang Yingying, Wei Zhi, and Jiang Xiaoche...</p>

    <p>These people Wang Ling all know each other.</p>

    <p>No matter how deeply you hide your aura, you can't escape Wang Ling's perception.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels a little tired.</p>

    <p>On this trip, it seems that everyone came with a purpose. It can be said that "each has his own agenda."</p>

    <p>But other things are harmless. Now Wang Ling is more concerned about the few people from the Jiugong family who have been following Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>As soon as we entered the ancient street, Wang Ling noticed this group of people sneaking behind.</p>

    <p>And it was quickly determined that these people were actually following Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>And he deliberately kept a long distance. He was afraid that he would be discovered.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that as Jiugong Liangzi is an eldest lady, it is reasonable for the Jiugong family to send someone to secretly protect her.</p>

    <p>But this group of people...are obviously not Jiugong Liangzi's bodyguards.</p>

    <p>Although they are both members of the Jiugong family, they definitely did not come with the purpose of protecting Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>There is murderous intent hidden in each of them, as if they are preparing to plan something. These are the top masters of the Jiugong family. It is difficult for ordinary people to distinguish the restrained murderous intent in them.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the reasons why Wang Ling spotted this group of people as soon as they entered the ancient street.</p>

    <p>Of course. The current situation actually becomes very interesting.</p>

    <p>Because the Jiugong family did not realize that they had been exposed.</p>

    <p>And they didn't even know that right behind them, there was another man staring at them...</p>

    <p>"Let me remind Zhuo Yi first." Wang Ling muttered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't even take out his phone. He just put his hand in his trouser pocket and opened the screen. With his skillful operation, he quickly clicked on the screen.</p>

    <p>A specially edited text message sent to Zhuo Yi was sent like this.</p>

    <p>To outsiders, Wang Ling just put his hand into his trouser pocket and inserted it. There is nothing unnatural about it.</p>

    <p>Anyway, for now, let's concentrate on the matter at hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's expression looks relaxed. But in fact, the vigilance inside has never been lowered.</p>

    <p>In addition to these complicated things behind it, he also noticed that many people were turning their attention to him at this moment.</p>

    <p>Many girls shopping passed him while whispering to each other.</p>

    <p>Whispering softly, "Hey, that boy with single eyelids is quite interesting looking!"</p>

    <p>"Indeed. White shirt! There is also an ascetic style! The key is. Isn't this the ideal face of my first love!"</p>

    <p>Although these girls spoke very quietly, Wang Ling could still hear them clearly.</p>

    <p>No wonder...</p>

    <p>Mother Wang dressed him up so well today.</p>

    <p>It would be better to wear normal clothes.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't really matter if you are seen. Because the "Great Shielding Technique" has been upgraded.</p>

    <p>Don't look at these girls who are still talking about themselves. They will forget it soon when they look back.</p>

    <p>In the current "Great Shielding Technique", a "Fate Intersection Function" has been added.</p>

    <p>In other words. Now except malicious investigations will be blocked.</p>

    <p>These passers-by will never have a deep interaction with Wang Ling in Wang Ling's life. Even if they have seen Wang Ling, they will quickly forget the appearance of Wang Ling..</p>

    <p>It's like a dream.</p>

    <p>No matter how mysterious the content of the dream is, most people will not remember what they dreamed about after a while after waking up.</p>

    <p>"So where are we going?" Chen Chao looked somewhere: "I think that's good!"</p>

    <p>It was an ancient cold weapons store. The name of the store on the signboard read "Sir, times have changed!"</p>

    <p>The cultivators of the old era did not have such powerful magical weapons.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the wisdom of modern science. What this cold weapon shop introduces are all the cold weapons commonly used by cultivators of that era.</p>

    <p>It's very bulky. And it requires a lot of spiritual energy to increase the power of the magic weapon.</p>

    <p>"This store has tours and activities. Each activity costs 100 yuan, and there are prizes." At this time, Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Last night, she had already read the entire ancient street guide. Although it was her first time here, she was actually very familiar with every store.</p>

    <p>"What kind of activity is it?"</p>

    <p>"It's just stone spear throwing. See how far you can throw it. However, the activity is only open to cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage. We are all students of the Foundation Building stage. If you have a student ID, you don't need to provide proof of realm."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Sun Rong couldn't help but glance at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Since knowing the true strength of Wang Ling, many things now. Sun Rong has to be considered in light of Wang Ling's actual situation.</p>

    <p>Stone spear throwing.</p>

    <p>As for other people, it's just for fun. The venue is very wide and there won't be any tricks.</p>

    <p>If classmate Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It's very dangerous!</p>

    <p>If the force is not controlled well, it may be thrown directly out of the solar system...</p>

    <p>"Where's the prize?" At this time, Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"Each distance has different rewards. The grand prize distance is 5,000 meters. It is actually quite difficult. The Stone Spear is very heavy. It is somewhat difficult to throw."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "The grand prize is a Marrow Cleansing Pill. The second prize is a Beauty Rejuvenation Pill. The third prize is an ancient street consumption coupon. There is also an encouragement prize for throwing less than 100 meters. It is this cold weapon store. Medal."</p>

    <p>It seems that he heard what Sun Rong said. An employee in the cold weapon store suddenly walked out: "Is this your first time coming to the ancient street? Haha. Today's prize is not a medal."</p>

    <p>"Not a medal?"Sun Rong was stunned: "But I obviously yesterday..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. The "encouragement prizes" in our store are actually not fixed. For example, today they will be replaced by ancient street limited snack coupons."</p>

    <p>"..." After listening to Sun Rong, I suddenly felt that this matter was full of strangeness.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason. If that is the case.</p>

    <p>This kind of detail shouldn't have been missed in the platinum guide she read.</p>

    <p>"This is an event organized by our store in conjunction with the flagship store of instant noodles in Gujie next door. You can go to their store to win a lottery with your lottery ticket. If this is your first time here, you can have a chance to try it out for free." At this time. The clerk smiled meaningfully.</p>

    <p>"Why do you, a cold weapon store, specifically cooperate with a snack shop..."</p>

    <p>"In addition to being a snack shop, we are also a shop that offers sports programs, right? Since it is sports, there is consumption. It is reasonable to use snacks to replenish energy!"</p>

    <p>The clerk replied: "A cold weapon shop without crispy noodles is like losing the starting point of this chapter. It has no soul!"</p>

    <p>"..." After listening to Sun Rong, I suddenly felt that things became even weirder...</p>

    <p>The only person who knows that classmate Wang Ling likes crispy noodles is not only the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception, but also her.</p>

    <p>The only thing left might be...</p>

    <p>Grandpa?</p>
