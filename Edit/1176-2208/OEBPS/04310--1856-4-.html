  <h1>Chapter 1856 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Confirmed, the right person.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong never imagined that she would meet Zhang Zhui so quickly.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Zhang Zhui disguises himself extremely well.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for his habit of taking out wires casually that betrayed him, Sun Rong still wouldn't know that this is Zhang Zhui himself.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong determined that the reason why Zhang Zhui was able to disguise himself so well was mainly because Zhang Zhui was originally an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>So since he is an eternal person, he should also have some understanding of this period of history.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is another situation where Zhang Zhui's memory synchronization of this body is better than hers.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that maybe the Sun Goddess had really lost her memory. That's why she didn't receive any memories about the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Miss Sun, you would actually enter the body of the Sun Goddess..."</p>

    <p>At this time, even Zhang Zhui was frightened. But fortunately, he finally met someone familiar. This made Zhang Zhui feel relieved at the same time.</p>

    <p>However, this greeting made Sun Rong seem a little nervous: "Hey. Is it okay if you don't follow the lines...?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, don't worry too much. As long as you complete the prescribed things within the prescribed time and in accordance with the trajectory of history, it will not affect the future."</p>

    <p>After Zhang Zhui finished speaking, he couldn't help but sigh: "The key now is how to find the other people and how to get out of this old world of mysterious texts."</p>

    <p>"As long as you complete the history recorded in the mysterious text and complete the process as it is, that's it, right?"</p>

    <p>"That's the theory."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "But I feel that this is a plot set up by someone behind the scenes. And this plot has been planned for many years. I'm afraid the purpose behind it is not that simple."</p>

    <p>"This is a big move across time lines and space lines. Even that guy Jin Deng couldn't withstand the pressure."</p>

    <p>"And there are only a handful of people who have the ability to do this."</p>

    <p>"Is it Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>"Possible. But no evidence."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "In addition to Dao Ancestor Wang, there is also the possibility of the Four Eternal Emperors under Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he tested the keyhole with a wire. After a while, he opened the sealed palace door and led Sun Rong inside.</p>

    <p>"I remember. The one I want to see later is a great emperor?" Sun Rong followed and asked.</p>

    <p>"It's Emperor Dongda." Zhang Zhui replied. Immediately a look of suspicion appeared on his face: "Strange. Miss Sun's memory is not synchronized at all?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all. I can only judge from this injured body that it just went through a big battle. And the original memory of this body has not entered my mind at all."</p>

    <p>"It's strange. Apparently after I entered the body of the white-robed manager, his memory synchronized with mine."</p>

    <p>"Hey. That's not all the weird things happened. I found that Ying'er is also missing." Sun Rong sighed.</p>

    <p>"Sun Ying'er? The Lord of the Void? Your shadow?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid...it won't be easy..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui frowned. Suddenly he felt the complexity of the problem.</p>

    <p>"How do you say that?"</p>

    <p>"There is a low. But scary possibility."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "Could it be that the body and spiritual consciousness of the Sun Goddess are separated and synchronized..."</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhang means that Ying'er inherited that memory. And all I inherited was this body?"</p>

    <p>"That's what it means." Zhang Zhui nodded and said: "If this is really the case, it will be particularly troublesome...This means that before leaving this world, girl Ying'er must be found. Otherwise, it will change the trajectory of history."</p>

    <p>"Although according to historical records, the Sun Goddess was burned to ashes by the Emperor of the East with the supreme light Kongque Mingwang in front of everyone in the Eastern Region. There are no historical records in the future. But the real situation is that the Sun Goddess is still alive."</p>

    <p>"And she was imprisoned in the palace of Emperor Dongda for a long time. She could never get out again."</p>

    <p>"But even so, her soul and body have never been separated... If left alone, I'm afraid it will cause other changes in the future."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong While listening to Zhang Zhui's analysis, the expression between his eyebrows became more and more solemn.</p>

    <p>She didn't want to cause trouble to Wang Ling. But she didn't expect that her momentary willfulness would lead to the current situation.</p>

    <p>"This is a historical necessity. Miss Sun, there is no need to blame yourself and be too nervous. We still have the last trump card, don't we?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui comforted her.</p>

    <p>Thinking back to those days, this master thief was once a lover who showed mercy to everyone. Those young girls and young women who still have charm in the eternity were more or less "persecuted" by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the thoughts of a little girl like Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Even with a bandage on her face, Zhang Zhui could read it in her eyes.</p>

    <p>Very understandable.</p>

    <p>"The trump card that Senior Zhang was talking about couldn't be classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Who else but Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled bitterly and said: "Previously, Ms. Sun and that Taoist priest You discovered the mysterious text on the white wall. And Ling Zhenren asked you not to get too involved.</p>

    <p>"If Ling Zhenren investigates this mysterious text, I think there is a high probability that he will also enter this world and play a certain role."</p>

    <p>"So the key now is to find Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>"But Ling Zhenren doesn't talk much. It's difficult to tell which one is Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui has a headache.</p>

    <p>It's like the Werewolf game. There are always new players who are clumsy at talking. They get the identity card but don't know how to analyze the situation. They stay silent throughout the game. In the end, they hold the identity card and are beaten by the wolf.</p>

    <p>Since entering the modern world of cultivation, Zhang Zhui has also become obsessed with Werewolf. In Werewolf games, encountering such silent teammates is often the most devastating...</p>

    <p>"Go in first. We have to think of another solution for now."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed. He suddenly felt that the difficulty of this game had skyrocketed.</p>

    <p>He took Sun Rong to the inside of this palace. This was originally the backup heart-nurturing palace of Emperor Dongda. It has been closed on weekdays. Only Ye Ren himself has the key.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui actually has a key on his body. But for Zhang Zhui himself, it doesn't matter whether he has a key or not.</p>

    <p>Because no matter what kind of lock it is, his wire can open it.</p>

    <p>For Zhang Zhui, iron wire is a master key.</p>

    <p>This is a secret meeting.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui brought Sun Rong to the designated location. Then he lowered the gauze curtain on the side.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's figure behind the gauze curtain looked hazy and blurry. It was like Emperor Dongda had summoned a certain concubine.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that sitting behind the gauze curtain was the goddess of the sun who was reduced to ashes in full view of everyone.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui rang the bell. From outside the palace, a palace maid came in carrying a tray with a delicate jade porcelain pot placed on it.</p>

    <p>However, the palace maid's walking posture was extremely strange. She seemed to be very uncomfortable with the mass of her chest. She walked with a limp...</p>
