  <h1>Chapter 1628: 1 side is in trouble and 8 sides provide support</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"The sect leader orders! All sect! Disciples of Golden Core and above gather quickly at the North Square!"</p>

    <p>"The sect master! The whole sect! The disciples below the Golden Core immediately prepare for wartime deployment! Please command the elders to get in place!"</p>

    <p>Dang! Dang! Dang!...</p>

    <p>When the mighty assembly bell of the Office of Strategic Deception rang from inside the sect, tens of thousands of disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception quickly returned to their respective positions according to the instructions issued by the command center and according to the original drill.</p>

    <p>Only this time, it's not a drill.</p>

    <p>It's a serious battle!</p>

    <p>Today, the Office of Strategic Deception, recognized as the number one sect in the world, is actually going to take the initiative to start a war!</p>

    <p>This incident made all the disciples of the sect feel briefly dazed.</p>

    <p>After the Zhanmen disciples came to their senses, they were replaced by a strong sense of excitement.</p>

    <p>Although the Office of Strategic Deception has not been established for a long time, the disciples who join the Office of Strategic Deception all know that their sect has a strong foundation.</p>

    <p>This is sure to be a rich fight!</p>

    <p>A fight for wealth that may not come in eight lifetimes!</p>

    <p>It must be known that in peaceful times, cultivation sects that are under the jurisdiction of the state government must be approved for such large-scale preparations and gatherings to prepare for war!</p>

    <p>The relationship between Office of Strategic Deception and Huaxiu Alliance is inseparable.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for this large-scale operation to go without reporting.</p>

    <p>If other sects start a war, there may be doubts in society.</p>

    <p>But the Office of Strategic Deception is different.</p>

    <p>This is a sect that has joined the Huaxiu Alliance. It also represents the Huaxiu Alliance side.</p>

    <p>So here comes the question. Who is the person who wants to challenge the Office of Strategic Deception now?</p>

    <p>In less than a quarter of an hour after the sect leader's order was issued, all the disciples of the sect were summoned. They all performed their duties and started working according to the original plan.</p>

    <p>At the command center, Crispy Noodles, Dao Lord and Keorn are in charge.</p>

    <p>All the disciples above Golden Core have been transferred out. Naturally, it is impossible for the sect to be leaderless. With these two people shaking the scene, Lord Diulei is naturally very relieved.</p>

    <p>The underground command center of the Office of Strategic Deception was designed by Wang Ming himself. It is full of high-tech visuals.</p>

    <p>There is a golden sphere floating in the center of the command center. This sphere is positioned with every coordinate of the earth. It is connected to the exclusive satellite of the Office of Strategic Deception. The error is extremely small.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that you can use this command ball to win a battle thousands of miles away and see everything you want to see.</p>

    <p>"Do you have any requirements from the sect master?" Keorn asked.</p>

    <p>He joined the Office of Strategic Deception not long ago, but Lord Diulei liked him very much.</p>

    <p>This is a practical and capable person. And the most important thing is that Keorn has a doctorate in warfare and cultivation weapons. Such knowledge is not something ordinary people can have.</p>

    <p>And he never asks much about other things. He just completes the tasks assigned to him by Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This makes Keorn well received.</p>

    <p>"It's best to capture them all alive," Crispy Noodles said.</p>

    <p>"Catch them all alive?" Keorn frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"I know it's difficult." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>"Control the enemy's casualty rate below 1%. Of course. All bases on the opposite side must be destroyed."</p>

    <p>"Understood." Keorn nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>Right now, we can only do our best.</p>

    <p>He knew that the people on the top of the mountain wanted to capture him alive. The main reason was that he wanted to know what kind of medicine was being sold in the gourd over there at Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, even a casualty rate of less than 1% seems very difficult.</p>

    <p>Because based on the news Keorn has learned so far.</p>

    <p>The people responsible for the battle. They are not the only ones in the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>Such a large-scale action can be said to affect the whole body.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know Liu Renfeng. It can almost be said that he has never heard of it.</p>

    <p>This Mrs. Fengchu seems to be well-known in the Academy of Cultivation Science. But in Keorn's eyes, this Liu Renfeng is an unlucky person.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Less than ten minutes after this order from the Office of Strategic Deception was issued. Using modern network information dissemination, the matter was further amplified.</p>

    <p>There are many sects that have received orders to assist in the war. Among them is the "Tianming Alliance" who tried to unite before but in fact they were defeated (see Chapter 819 for a review of the previous situation).</p>

    <p>Before the Office of Strategic Deception was established, the 17 heaven-level sects in the alliance protected each other, blocking the promotion paths of the sects behind them.</p>

    <p>On the day when the Office of Strategic Deception opened, Lu Youming, the president of the Tongmenghui, tried to launch an attack under tremendous pressure. But in the end, everything failed.</p>

    <p>Especially after knowing that the backer behind the Office of Strategic Deception was Huaxiu Alliance, Lu Youming almost had the urge to stab himself to death.</p>

    <p>Due to the existence of the Office of Strategic Deception, the balance of order among the clans in Huaxiu has been disrupted for a long time. The existence of the Alliance has long existed in name only. On the surface, it is still a family. In fact, all the clans are experiencing problems in their operations.</p>

    <p>In the past few days, many sect leaders could not withstand the pressure. I originally wanted Lu Youming as a representative to go to the Office of Strategic Deception and take the initiative to discuss cooperation.</p>

    <p>But after all, he had done such a shameful thing. Lu Youming himself was also troubled.</p>

    <p>But what Lu Youming didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>Today, the Alliance actually received a "war support message" from the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming was flattered by this and immediately summoned all the heaven-level sect leaders of the Alliance.</p>

    <p>"Everyone...what do you think about this matter?" Lu Youming asked.</p>

    <p>"With the power and foundation of the Office of Strategic Deception, why do we need to help in the fight? This is obviously to build momentum. I'm afraid it is done to show others." The leader of the Feiyue Sect analyzed.</p>

    <p>"Since the rise of the Office of Strategic Deception, everyone's sect has been affected to a certain extent. To be honest, if it were in the past, I would definitely not go. But for the sake of livelihood, I think I can give it a try..."</p>

    <p>Sun Hanzhe, the leader of Luowang Sect, said: "I heard from other people in the circle that Diulei Sect Leader has always been a righteous person. Now he has reached the top of True Venerated Immortal. He doesn't seem to be a small-minded person. I will definitely accept this olive branch. Yes. Even if you object, I will go."</p>

    <p>"Brother Sun, why do you need to express your position in a hurry? We didn't say we couldn't go."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Go! Go now!"</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, all the sect leaders spoke one after another. The crowd was excited.</p>

    <p>When Lu Youming saw this, he already knew something in his mind: "So now it seems that all the sect leaders here have no objections. Now, let's start counting the number of Golden Core and above disciples in the 17 heaven-level sects of our alliance."</p>

    <p>"Currently, we have 17 heaven-level sects. The number of disciples above Golden Core is 36,000."</p>

    <p>"According to the support post from the Office of Strategic Deception, all sect leaders are requested to lead the sect's Golden Core and above disciples to gather in the northern suburbs at ten o'clock tonight!"</p>

    <p>After Lu Youming finished speaking, the remaining sixteen sect leaders present stood up one after another. They clasped their fists and bowed in front of the audience, saying in unison.</p>

    <p>"I'll wait...and obey the order!"</p>

    <p>"Rush to the Office of Strategic Deception!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The scale of this team battle was jaw-dropping.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming originally thought that the Office of Strategic Deception+their 17 heaven-level sects were already at their limit...</p>

    <p>However, after Lu Youming accepted the task of arranging the support post, he joined the group chat of the Office of Strategic Deception1225 temporary command team.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until this moment that he realized to his surprise that things were far from simple as he imagined.</p>

    <p>Because. In this temporary command group...</p>

    <p>Most of his friends in the cultivation world have already joined!</p>

    <p>These people are all sect leaders from all over the world, at home and abroad!</p>

    <p>At this time, the number of people in the group is still soaring!</p>

    <p>As of five minutes after Lu Youming joined the 1225 command group, this group had already gathered 270 sect leaders at prefectural level and above.</p>
