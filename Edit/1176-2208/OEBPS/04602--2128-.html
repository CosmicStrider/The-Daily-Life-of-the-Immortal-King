  <h1>Chapter 2128 Wang Ling's identity + one</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same moment. Mr. Canghu, who had confirmed the scope of land reclamation with the team leader, vaguely heard a huge vibration in the distance while traveling.</p>

    <p>The rumbling sound lasted for a while. He immediately asked the bald captain: "Where is this sound coming from?"</p>

    <p>The team leader thought for a while, determined the direction and replied: "It seems to be the direction of Fuyun Town."</p>

    <p>The distance between Fuyun Town and Huanglong Town is actually quite far. Without the help of magic weapons that do not have the ability to control the sky, we can't reach them in just a few days' journey by horse and carriage. It takes about five days for a round trip at the normal pace of carriage and horse. time.</p>

    <p>But the noise was too loud. It was like a bomb exploding. It came from such a long distance. Mr. Canghu couldn't help but be surprised.</p>

    <p>He is one of the few insiders in Operation Wall Breaker. But Mr. Canghu actually has a hunch that the official side will definitely arrange other insiders to help him secretly. Something like this that is absolutely confidential is impossible at best. Let more than two digits of people know.</p>

    <p>So whether it was caused by other insiders of the wall-breaking plan or not, Mr. Canghu couldn't tell at the moment. Because Wang Ming told him before entering the game that he would meet other normal Huaxiu players in the game.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal adopts a non-deletion system for internal testing. Therefore, there will also be many Huaxiu players in this game world. And most Huaxiu players have already left the Novice Village. It's just that he is currently at this stage. Just out of reach.</p>

    <p>The biggest advantage of letting other normal gamers participate is that it can be used to cover the operation. It will make people think that this is just an ordinary game.</p>

    <p>As for the real wall-breaking plan to begin, they need to go out from the Novice Village and then gather their strength to break the invisible continental wall that surrounds another continent in the world of Itinerant Immortal. And this continental wall. It is the wall of spiritual consciousness in the real world.</p>

    <p>But it is ineffective to just rely on them to break this continental wall. Players who are monks from other countries who are bewitched by the Wall of Spiritual Consciousness must be allowed to break it in person. Only in this way can we ensure that the Wall of Spiritual Consciousness is completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>Staring in the direction of Fuyun Town, Mr. Canghu was thoughtful. A normal NPC would definitely not be able to make such a movement.</p>

    <p>In other words, the person who made the big move is either a normal game player. Or he is a secret wall breaker who participated in the action with him.</p>

    <p>The most likely result is still an ordinary game player. He doesn't understand games. But he understands today's young people too well... Many young people nowadays just don't like playing games and can't leave the novice village.</p>

    <p>He thought about the long-lasting turn-based game {Psychedelic Journey to the West} that has remained popular from the past to the present. There is such a legendary player who has been playing turtles in Novice Village for more than ten years...</p>

    <p>How to put it? To put it nicely, it means perseverance. To put it badly, it means people get bored, which is really scary.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu sighed silently.</p>

    <p>At present, we need to ensure the ultimate success of the Wall Breaker plan. First, we must ensure that they themselves can develop smoothly. In this way, during the game, we will encounter those foreign player monks who are suspected of being brainwashed by the Wall of Spiritual Consciousness. Only then can we have the capital to win over them. Then At that time, you can open a sect, gather strength, and finally command them to complete the wall-breaking operation...</p>

    <p>This is the legendary. Unity can unite all the forces!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I have to say that Mr. Canghu's wish is very good, but it is still difficult to implement it.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling poked out the ten-hole demon lord with one finger. Sun Rong was so surprised that her entire face was distorted. She was speechless and didn't understand. But she was greatly shocked.</p>

    <p>And he saw his experience bar skyrocketing again. He quickly reached level ten.</p>

    <p>And what about the general over there...</p>

    <p>The character level remains at level 1.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, this is an NPC. Only the NPC's level will not change.</p>

    <p>But she has never been able to figure out why a level 1 novice village general can have 300,000 HP. He can also destroy the ten-hole demon lord with one finger.</p>

    <p>Seeing the Demon Lord being destroyed, Wang Ling was filled with emotions. He locked his level because he expected that Sun Rong might directly tell that he was not an NPC through his level.. Just thinking about it, I felt that it would be very embarrassing if we met directly. So Wang Ling locked his level without stopping.</p>

    <p>In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, level locking is usually done after the main missions and maps have been expanded to a certain stage. In order to accumulate experience for future promotions and job changes.</p>

    <p>No one will directly lock their level in the Novice Village. So this is one of the reasons why Sun Rong has no doubt about him.</p>

    <p>So now she is almost completely convinced that the general of Fuyun Town is the NPC... but this NPC is a bit outrageous. It's like a plug-in specially arranged for him by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Watching myself skyrocket in an instant, and finally settling on level 25. Sun Rong felt quite dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>On the other side. If Wang Ling unlocks the level lock, his level will be instantly raised to level 15. However, Wang Ling did not do that.</p>

    <p>Not upgrading means that he cannot add new attribute points and obtain talent points for skill distribution. However, these are harmless to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He has two god-level skills at his disposal. And what he needs is the level difference. Therefore, level is not critical to him.</p>

    <p>Of course. In addition to level, Wang Ling was not completely without gains. After the Ten-hole Demon Lord was destroyed, in addition to experience, Wang Ling also found that he had an extra waist in his inventory. Card.</p>

    <p>This is the object of the Demon Lord of the Ten Caves. It symbolizes the identity of the Demon Lord of the Ten Caves.</p>

    <p>Having this token means that he can directly control and direct these ten cave demon spirits for his own use and obey his command.</p>

    <p>So... could it be...</p>

    <p>At this time, under Huwei's mask, Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, in his character identity tag column, with the appearance of this token of the Ten-hole Demon Lord, a brand new identity followed.</p>

    <p>He.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>An ordinary, unremarkable high school student from Xiuzhen Academy with average academic performance...</p>

    <p>In the world of Itinerant Immortal, has multiple identities.</p>

    <p>At this moment. His new identity tags are: [Good-for-nothing], [Prison Leader], [General Chen of Fuyun Town], [Demon Lord of Ten Cave]...</p>

    <p>He is obviously a human monk, but he has become the Demon Lord of the Ten Caves.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling feel a little complicated for a moment.</p>

    <p>But having these demon spirits means that these demon spirits can also be transformed into his labor force!</p>

    <p>Although five hundred demon spirits are not many...</p>

    <p>But invest a part of it to mine materials, and let the other part lead you to take out other demon caves. Wang Ling thinks it may be a good choice to obtain mining manpower in the short term.</p>

    <p>Because demon spirits do not need to eat. They are purely natural laborers. There is no need to consider the issue of food consumption.</p>
