  <h1>Chapter 1506 The clever use of Sang and Jiang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Houlang. This doesn't sound like a native name from the Sun Island.</p>

    <p>But if you chew it carefully, Yingxian Heming feels that it actually tastes very good.</p>

    <p>Because it is not necessary to use the full name when calling someone by name.</p>

    <p>Just remove the last name and add another word after it, and the internal flavor will come immediately.</p>

    <p>For example: Houlang Sang, Houlang Jiang... etc.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. I think this name is really good. It sounds catchy." Yingxian Heming sighed: "What about the rest of you? Rong Jiang, Xiaoer Jiang?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe High School is a high school founded by the Jiugong family. It is very well-known in the mainland of Sun Island. It has comprehensive enrollment and is not specifically targeted at nobles.</p>

    <p>This is an exchange student event. Sun Rong is here to help Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But in fact, it is also a rare opportunity to rectify the names of cultivators of the same age in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>Because of differences in cultural environments and educational backgrounds, there are actually differences in the quality of cultivators in various countries.</p>

    <p>As Jiudaohe High School is a famous school on Sun Island, the quality of its high school students is mostly from the late Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>Some even broke through the Golden Core in high school.</p>

    <p>And this has created a phenomenon of xenophobia. Facing some students from foreign countries, Jiudaohe students will have a sense of superiority.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Yingxian Heming has always been worried that some "campus violence" will occur during the exchange student activities.</p>

    <p>These three people who came all the way from Number 60 High School were all distinguished guests of Jiugong's family. Moreover, they were friends who Jiugong Liangzi had greeted by name in advance.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Yingxian Heming was very cautious about the admission of the three people Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Including the current "localized naming" opinions. It is also a bit of Yingxian Heming's own ingenuity.</p>

    <p>He felt that if Wang Ling and others had a more localized name, it might be easier for them to be accepted by the children in school.</p>

    <p>"I have a question."</p>

    <p>On the top of the mountain. At this time, Yingxian Heming took a sip of hot tea. He looked at Sun Rong and asked.</p>

    <p>"What do you want to ask Mr. Yingxian?"</p>

    <p>To Yingxian Heming's surprise, Sun Rong actually communicated with him directly in the native language of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>It doesn't feel lame at all. It doesn't have any accent! It's very authentic!</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang actually knows our Sun Island dialect?" Yingxian Heming was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's not that difficult to learn."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled: "I was once appointed by my family. I came here to study."</p>

    <p>After all, the girl's visa alone has entry stamps from hundreds of countries...</p>

    <p>And the variety of languages Sun Rong masters is actually quite rich.</p>

    <p>She speaks dozens of languages from different countries.</p>

    <p>"Rong-chan is amazing..."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He now finally knew why Jiugong Liangzi had always regarded the young lady in front of him as his opponent.</p>

    <p>"Actually, what I'm asking is not an important question. I just want to ask the three of you. Are you nervous?" At this time, Yingxian Heming continued.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong, Wang Ming and Zhai Yin. After the three of them exchanged glances with each other, they couldn't help but feel like laughing.</p>

    <p>"Why are you nervous?" Sun Rong said with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that Sun Rong now has the power of Aohai. Even before Aohai merged with the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>She still has enough confidence to face what is going to happen next.</p>

    <p>It's just cultivation.</p>

    <p>Who is not a genius boy or girl?</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought of this. She couldn't help but look at him.</p>

    <p>The young man's peaceful face was as calm as ever. He had no intention of taking the people in Jiudaohe seriously.</p>

    <p>It's obvious.</p>

    <p>The boy in front of him could no longer be described with the word "genius."</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling... will always be awesome!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe High School. Wang Ling, Sun Rong and Wang Ming, whose pseudonym is Wang Xiaoer.</p>

    <p>The exchange student enrollment information of the three people was quickly entered into the temporary student registration management database of Jiudaohe High School after Monk Jin Deng communicated with the principal of Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>This means.</p>

    <p>These three people have obtained temporary student status at Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Become a member here.</p>

    <p>News spreads quickly.</p>

    <p>The Jiudaohe Student Union also attaches great importance to this matter.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that what was supposed to come came anyway. That terrible woman back then..."</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe Student Union Office. A very individual golden retriever boy holds his chin.</p>

    <p>He sat in the president's seat with a serious look on his face.</p>

    <p>His name is Akano Jisaki. People give him a nickname: Chairman Ji.</p>

    <p>People who are familiar with him will also call him Ah Jiu directly.</p>

    <p>It is not a dyed blond hair on purpose. It is a natural blond hair caused by the spiritual root properties in the body.</p>

    <p>Many years ago, Akano Jisaki actually had a face-to-face encounter with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>At that time, he was beaten by Sun Rong in various aspects... He was completely defeated.</p>

    <p>But what Akano Jisaki never expected was that the opportunity to avenge his shame would come right before his eyes.</p>

    <p>He saw the information sent to the student union's backend database from the principal's office. After checking the information of Sun Rong, he couldn't help but feel relieved.</p>

    <p>Hehe!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>You didn't expect that?</p>

    <p>I am already a master in the early stages of Golden Core.</p>

    <p>You are still a Foundation Building...</p>

    <p>What are you going to fight me with?</p>

    <p>The excitement in Akano Jisaki's heart is self-evident.</p>

    <p>"Ah Jiu's wish for so many years is finally coming true."</p>

    <p>At this time, a girl with short hair and freckles on her face said: "Speaking of which, wouldn't Ah Jiu find it strange?"</p>

    <p>Her nickname is Ma Jiao. She is the vice president of the student union. She is also someone who is relatively close to Akano Jisaki.</p>

    <p>"What's so strange?"</p>

    <p>"Liangzi has been out for so long. Why would these people from Number 60 High School choose to come here at this time?"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao said: "The Jiugong family and Huaguo Shuilian Group are competitors. The Jiugong family invested in the construction of our Jiudaohe. They are obviously competitors. It's amazing that Rong Jiang would choose to come here at this time. I feel like there's a conspiracy here."</p>

    <p>"You think too much. They're all in Foundation Building. How can they have such a big idea."</p>

    <p>Jisaki frowned.</p>

    <p>That's what he said. But after hearing Ma Jiao's analysis, he thought it made sense.</p>

    <p>When this impromptu meeting about the exchange students is over.</p>

    <p>Akano Jisaki thought of his aunt at Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>The Sixth Mistress of the Jiugong family is the most favored wife of the Jiugong family. Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>The phone's ringing.</p>

    <p>Akano Jisaki's attitude was very humble. "Hello. Auntie?... Yes. I'm Akano Jisaki..."</p>

    <p>"No... I didn't get cut today. Auntie's joking again..."</p>

    <p>"It's like this, Auntie. I have three exchange students here. You might be interested..."</p>

    <p>"Right, right... There's a Sun Rong and two other Wangs. One is called Wang Xiao Er. The other one. Wang Houlang..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side of the phone. Jiugong Xinghui's expression instantly darkened. Her voice was lowered: "Ah Jiu. Say it again."</p>
