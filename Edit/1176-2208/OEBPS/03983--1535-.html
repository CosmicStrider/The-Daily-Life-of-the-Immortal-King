  <h1>Chapter 1535 Dao Ancestor Wang's Mission</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Can't escape. It fell..."</p>

    <p>Jingke is wearing a brown Tang suit. The white robe outside the Tang suit is flying in the strong wind.</p>

    <p>He upgraded his sword talisman suppression to a mechanical level. In an instant, he formed a dragnet that contained the four ancient divine soldiers with overwhelming pressure.</p>

    <p>Judging from the scene, it seems that everything is over.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was sitting on the wall of the ruins, feeling unusually calm.</p>

    <p>Because everything is a predictable scene.</p>

    <p>These ancient magic weapons have a mechanism of continuous resurrection. They seem difficult to deal with. But in fact Wang Ling is very clear. This will never be Jingke's opponent.</p>

    <p>It was easy for Jingke to suppress them.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen's ultimate goal is to rescue Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Even if we only send these four ancient divine soldiers, it will still be difficult to support the overall situation.</p>

    <p>It would be useless even if some ancient divine soldiers arrived one after another.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never had a head-on confrontation with Fenmu Shen. He just sent a "bomb" made of the new Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube as a gift.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was almost killed by him.</p>

    <p>Eh...need to circle the key points here.</p>

    <p>Yes: Almost...</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion. To be able to survive under his own circumstances. It's an amazing way of doing things.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren remarked. Back then, Fenmu Shen was a figure that even Dao Ancestor Wang was afraid of.</p>

    <p>The great master of cultivation is hunting down the whole universe.</p>

    <p>But Fenmu Shen did not die in the end.</p>

    <p>It was just divided into two parts and sealed.</p>

    <p>Now it has been released again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he had to be vigilant.</p>

    <p>In order to rescue Peng Xiren, these four ancient divine weapons were sacrificed... This proves that Fenmu Shen still has some background.</p>

    <p>But. Is it just that?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like there is some conspiracy hidden behind this.</p>

    <p>"Senior...we can't hold it off any longer!" Akano Sekitora shouted anxiously as he saw the four ancient divine weapons being trapped.</p>

    <p>He never thought that even the senior in the grave could do nothing to this young man.</p>

    <p>Even his sword spirit...can't limit it...</p>

    <p>You must know that it is just an ordinary-looking mahogany sword!</p>

    <p>But the gap in combat power is so huge.</p>

    <p>"You're too anxious."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen looked calm: "The strength of this peach wood sword is indeed beyond my expectation...but...the delay I am talking about is not this."</p>

    <p>His ancient magic weapon was a weapon specially created for the battle in the universe. It was strong.</p>

    <p>But Fenmu Shen also knows it very well.</p>

    <p>I want to deal with Wang Ling. But these four ancient divine weapons are not enough.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he closed his eyes slightly and followed a breath coming from the inside and outside the world.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, hundreds of millions of light years away from the earth, tens of thousands of stars were pierced by a pitch black spear engraved with runes. Then it exploded. Psychic energy shot into the sky. The scene was terrifying.</p>

    <p>At the same time, both inside and outside the inner world. Wang Ling, Jin Deng also raised their heads.</p>

    <p>Feel the fluctuation of this breath.</p>

    <p>"This is."</p>

    <p>On Earth. Jin Deng frowned.</p>

    <p>The familiar scent coming from outside the infinite galaxy at great speed made him immediately alert.</p>

    <p>He immediately started to move. He shrunk to the ground and blocked the breath from rushing out of the earth. He tried to intercept it.</p>

    <p>"Here he comes."</p>

    <p>Inside the Devouring Star, Fenmu Shen opened his eyes. He looked like a strategist.</p>

    <p>Everything was as he expected.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng wanted to stop him.</p>

    <p>Can it be stopped?</p>

    <p>In the universe, a golden avenue appears that is invisible to ordinary cultivators. It is like a gorgeous carpet. It seems to be derived from the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>The creature standing on the golden carpet. The first born has two horns. The steel wings are wide. The current body shape is only the size of an adult. But in fact, this is a condensed body shape.</p>

    <p>The real body is hundreds of millions of feet tall!</p>

    <p>This is also the second time the monk has seen it.</p>

    <p>"It's really you..." The monk's pupils contracted.</p>

    <p>The creature in front of me is not the other one.</p>

    <p>It is the Dharma of Dao Ancestor Wang!</p>

    <p>That creature named "Xie!"</p>

    <p>It is also one of the very few Dharma-like beings that can freely break away from the will of the Dharma-appearance owner and act!</p>

    <p>As soon as this Dharma image appeared, Wang Ling understood it instantly.</p>

    <p>It turns out that Fenmu Shen had this idea from the beginning.</p>

    <p>He speculated.</p>

    <p>Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang had the task of clearing out the ancient divine weapons. He probably left it to his Dharma-like creatures to complete.</p>

    <p>But some of them are at the bottom of the box.</p>

    <p>For example, the statues in front of me had their auras hidden very well, so they escaped unharmed.</p>

    <p>Now Fenmu Shen has brought these ancient magic weapons out again.</p>

    <p>It is not really necessary to rely on the power of the ancient magic weapon to delay.</p>

    <p>His true purpose.</p>

    <p>He wanted to deliberately leak the aura of the ancient divine weapon. He led "Zheng" here.</p>

    <p>As Dao Ancestor Wang's biggest enemy.</p>

    <p>The feud between Fenmu Shen and this "Zheng" has been going on for a long time.</p>

    <p>He knew it all too well, so he took advantage of it.</p>

    <p>Cleaning up the ancient divine weapons. And protecting the only inheritance of Dao Ancestor Wang. That is Peng Xiren who is currently trapped in King's Eyes... These are all tasks that belong to "Zheng."</p>

    <p>"Zheng. Xiren is no longer what he used to be. You and I should know it very well. The poor monk advises you to let go of your obsession and stop protecting him." Outside the earth, Monk Jin Deng was standing in front of the golden carpet. Give advice with good intentions.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>All I saw was Zheng holding his arms. A thought. Just for a moment. Heavenly Dao followed the instructions. The aura of chaos burst out.</p>

    <p>It exuded endless aura of destruction.</p>

    <p>Not a word was said.</p>

    <p>But the attitude has been very clear.</p>

    <p>Although Dao Ancestor Wang is missing today, he will still do his best to complete the tasks assigned to him by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Clean up the ancient divine weapons!</p>

    <p>Protect Peng Xiren!</p>

    <p>He wants them all!</p>

    <p>The ignorant monk Jin Deng stood in front of him, which made him feel unhappy.</p>

    <p>He was just a young monk back then... and almost became a disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang. If it weren't for Dao Ancestor Wang's liking for monks, he would have eliminated this rude monk a long time ago!</p>

    <p>Now, the young monk who grew up back then was so bold as to block his way.</p>

    <p>This suddenly made Zheng furious. He attempted to use the eternal energy of destruction to shock the monk to death.</p>

    <p>However.</p>

    <p>The Jin Deng of today is no longer the Jin Deng of then.</p>

    <p>Intimidation of this intensity is useless.</p>

    <p>He has an agreement with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even when Wang Ling is away, he will do his best to protect the earth.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>Facing his former opponent, the monk just clasped his hands together and showed the supreme Buddha's light, the holiest part of Buddhism!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The universe lit up.</p>

    <p>The Buddhist light emitted by the monk and the three-color Buddha fire of the past, future and present surrounding him seemed to have all the power to illuminate. It was vast and boundless.</p>

    <p>At this moment, even Zheng felt a little surprised.</p>

    <p>The young monk made rapid progress back then.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to kill you."</p>

    <p>The next second. Zheng spoke.</p>

    <p>He showed his hand and summoned a pitch black rune spear. He assumed a throwing posture and then threw it violently. It stabbed towards the monk's head!</p>

    <p>There was a roar. The space collapsed!</p>

    <p>This black spear is so terrifying. It completely occupies the space outside the earth in half. It is actually twisted to form a series of new black holes.</p>

    <p>The monk frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Just stretch out an index finger. Zoom in infinitely in the universe. Press the tip of the spear against it.</p>

    <p>This is the spiritual finger of monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>It is also the strongest fingering technique among all the fingering methods that the monk can currently master.</p>

    <p>The two fought back and forth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is in the other world. But he can already feel the spirit of the earth trembling.</p>

    <p>Keep fighting like this.</p>

    <p>This alien battle will sooner or later be noticed by all human cultivators...</p>

    <p>Helpless. Wang Ling sighed. He had no choice but to use the power of King's Eyes again. It was like a wifi amplifier device. It amplified the power of Peng XirenLi Zhitong.</p>

    <p>Directly derived into the scope of the universe.</p>

    <p>"Eh?" realized that the space had changed.</p>

    <p>Zheng takes back his rune spear. Stop.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that there were other masters.</p>

    <p>His eyes were slightly hesitant, looking at the direction of the earth.</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ling in the world located in the direction of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Then, looking at the monk, he was lost in thought and asked, "Your disciple?"</p>

    <p>This question. The monk Jin Deng was so scared that he broke into a sweat on the spot.</p>
