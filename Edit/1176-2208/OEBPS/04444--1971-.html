  <h1>Chapter 1971 The pattern is opened</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On that day, when the sky in the Spiritual World Number 2 Trial Ground was just shrouded in darkness, a hundred pioneer dwarf figurines sent from the main peak of the Twenty Peaks had already taken advantage of the night to survey the nearby terrain.</p>

    <p>These dwarf figurines, which were originally defined as "reconnaissance type" by Li Changzhe. Because of their special sensory design, they possess extraordinary keen insight. They quickly completely cleared the airtight defenses around Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>Many elite high school students from various countries who are proficient in perception spells have also arrived at the main camp at this moment.</p>

    <p>Through the information transmitted back by these pioneer figurines, use "mapping" to construct a three-dimensional map in the void with spiritual energy. Determine the location of the attack.</p>

    <p>Although the defense of Wuxiang Peak is airtight, it is not completely without loopholes. They occupy a favorable terrain and can block attacks from top to bottom. However, they cannot change the topography.</p>

    <p>"From point a here to point c. This place is covered by dense green spiritual plants. It is the best way to use it as a cover to move forward." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Finally, everyone decided on the final plan.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, almost no one on Wuxiang Peak could imagine that their peak would be surrounded by a dense mass of special human figurines...</p>

    <p>Under the cover of night, the terrain, and the special body shape, these human figurines sent by Twenty Peaks quickly relied on the terrain to shuttle from bottom to top. Although they were small in size, they were full of maneuverability.</p>

    <p>They managed to move forward in silence. Even if they occasionally made noises during the operation, they would not arouse the suspicion of the Golden Core figurines on the Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>At this time, the peak leader of Wuxiang Peak was holding a magical ball and was sitting in the main hall observing the overall situation.</p>

    <p>The defensive deployment of four hundred Golden Core combat puppets gave him a great sense of security.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that because of the reasons at the Jiutian Jingmi Academy command post, he can only use these humanoid battle puppets to defend and counterattack. If he can directly attack, just thinking about it makes people feel overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>"Sect Master, I'm looking at the map shown by the ball. Is there any movement in the forest to the east?" Qi Yuheng has been standing on the edge. His observation skills are very keen. He frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"The mountain wind at Wuxiang Peak can be very strong at night. It is normal for the vegetation to sway."</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak said: "And the ecology near Wuxiang Peak is good. Small spiritual beasts appear from time to time. It's not surprising. Do you think someone is hiding in it? Impossible. The vegetation is not high enough to hide a person. The size of humans is still too large compared to those small spiritual beasts. Even if they are crawling inside, the movement is not small."</p>

    <p>Qi Yuheng nodded slightly: "Of course I know this. I just want to remind the sect leader. It's not the time to slack off yet. We still need to be cautious."</p>

    <p>"Well. What you said makes sense. So..."</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak nodded. Then he fiddled with the magic ball with one hand. With the other hand, he controlled the tablet in his hand and began to test the vegetation in the distance that seemed to have signs of biological activity.</p>

    <p>The moment the nearest warrior figurine receives the order.</p>

    <p>Chuchuchu!</p>

    <p>The "Finger Spear TechniqueÂ·Earth" was activated almost instantly. Three consecutive rounds of homemade bullets shot down from the high ground. Several airflows rubbed the air and passed quickly across.</p>

    <p>This is just a tentative attack.</p>

    <p>Then, more bullets came, aiming at the dense vegetation from the peak of Wuxiang Peak. Tens of thousands of bullets were fired in an instant. Although such magic bullets are small, they cover such dense firepower. If there is really someone in the vegetation Lying down. The probability of getting shot in the head is still very high.</p>

    <p>Once someone is headshot, the elimination mechanism of the spiritual world will be triggered, and a golden light shield will be formed on the body.</p>

    <p>By that time, it was clear whether there were people among the vegetation.</p>

    <p>"It seems they are still very cautious." In the headquarters of Twenty Peaks, Sun Rong is also paying close attention to the situation ahead.</p>

    <p>When the selected vegetation was attacked by finger-marking techniques, all the elite high school students around them almost held their breath.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face was very calm, because she knew that the strength of these special figurines was actually higher than those of the earth bullets fired.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, psychic clay is extremely tough. It will not be defeated by bullets made from ordinary clay.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, these special figurines may be small in size, but warriors are warriors!</p>

    <p>The mission they were created for was to fight. Not to mention the hail of bullets. Even if the sky fell apart and the earth fell apart, they would not frown.</p>

    <p>For the sake of caution, Wuxiang Peak focused on that piece of vegetation for half an hour and then stopped.</p>

    <p>There was no golden light shield. There was no other movement. Not even a trace of wailing was heard.</p>

    <p>At this time, the leader of Wuxiang Peak was officially relieved.</p>

    <p>"Look. Let me tell you. This is the sound of the wind blowing. There is no one lurking in it. These people are ghosts and ghosts. There is no way they are hiding in there."</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak said: "And given their level, it is impossible to use the Earth Escape Technique in that kind of terrain."</p>

    <p>"The roots of these spiritual plants are no different from thorns. These spiritual plants were originally planted on the slope in that direction to prevent anyone from trying to enter my Wuxiang Peak in a roundabout way through earth escape."</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak is quite proud.</p>

    <p>These spiritual plants look friendly on the surface, but the roots underneath are connected together, like a huge spider web. It is also full of barbs and spikes, which can effectively defend against the use of earth escape techniques.</p>

    <p>Using the Earth Escape Technique here will almost immediately trigger the elimination mechanism of the spirit world. It is no different from giving someone a head.</p>

    <p>"The sect leader's thinking is really thorough." Qi Yuheng smiled. There was a sparkle in his eyes, but he didn't know what he was thinking about.</p>

    <p>"They are just some conventional tactical layouts. They are not moral." The leader of Wuxiang Peak waved his hand. He laughed: "It should be impossible for someone to hide in that spiritual plant and suffer our beatings in vain."</p>

    <p>"The lord is wise!"</p>

    <p>All the disciples in the sect master hall turned to him and saluted.</p>

    <p>This kind of firepower offensive really made everyone feel more at ease.</p>

    <p>Especially those elite cultivators from high school who chose to follow Qu Shuling into the Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>After learning the news of Qu Shuling's disappearance, they were very panicked in the face of the attack of Twenty Peaks. Because if they could not survive the day of the sect competition and were eliminated in such a dejected manner, they would probably directly become The clown in the eyes of others. The elite image no longer exists.</p>

    <p>But now, the defenses on the peak of Wuxiang Peak are strong. Even if they can't come out, there won't be any problem.</p>

    <p>All that's left is to wait for the day of the sect competition. A fair 1v1 duel.</p>

    <p>But what they didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wuxiang Peak was surrounded by a strange army of human figurines.</p>

    <p>They may not be able to survive the day of the sect competition.</p>

    <p>In addition to these thousands of special human figurines, in the dense forest at the foot of Wuxiang Peak, there is also a pair of dead fish eyes with delicate features staring in that direction...</p>

    <p>At this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked in that direction of the void. There was a dark aura passing through from a distance.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was right next to Wang Ling. Seeing this, he raised his hand politely to catch the light. Then a surprised expression appeared on his face: "It's amazing. It was repaired so quickly?"</p>

    <p>This aura was none other than Qu Shuling's spiritual sword, Zhan Ye, which had been secretly repaired by Zhen Yuan.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhan Ye, the cracks on it had completely disappeared. The dark body was dotted with stars. The moment Li Changzhe held it, his eyes were covered by a galaxy illusion...</p>

    <p>It was an illusion that came and disappeared in an instant.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Li Changzhe feels that Zhan Ye's pattern is a bit opened up...</p>
