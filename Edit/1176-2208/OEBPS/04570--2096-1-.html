  <h1>Chapter 2096 A mysterious royal family from the East</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Bai Yinshou was a little surprised. He didn't expect that Qiao Yanyuan was still a flexible and flexible dragonborn. In such a state, he could obliterate anyone he wanted to on earth. But now he contacted Mi Xiu Yuan Zun. And Start follow-up negotiations with him.</p>

    <p>He looked at the coldness in Qiao Yanyuan's eyes. He felt in his heart that he could no longer see through this man.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this was an encrypted conversation, a communication directly through spiritual consciousness. Bai Yinshou could only see Qiao Yanyuan opening his mouth, but could not hear what he was saying. He could not conduct language analysis through lip reading.</p>

    <p>Because what he speaks is the exclusive language of the Dragonborn. It is also a specially encrypted language that can be heard and understood by designated people.</p>

    <p>The negotiation lasted for about ten minutes. The projection of Misu Yuan Zun in the void disappeared.</p>

    <p>Mankind's greatest enemy is always man himself.</p>

    <p>There are no eternal friends between the country of cultivation and the country of cultivation. There are only eternal interests.</p>

    <p>After seeing Mi Xiu Yuan Zun off, Bai Yinshou bowed respectfully when he saw the corners of Qiao Yanyuan's mouth turned up. "It seems that Mr. Qiao's negotiation went smoothly."</p>

    <p>"He accepted all my requests."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan said: "I'm just an Earth monk. Even a great cultivator, Guoyuan Zun, can't refuse the generous terms I offer."</p>

    <p>The disputes between human monks since ancient times have all been caused by selfish interests. Even under the modern framework system, this law between the cultivation country and the cultivation country is eternal.</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou originally wanted to ask Qiao Yanyuan why he didn't use force to deter him.</p>

    <p>But now he saw Qiao Yanyuan's expression of enjoyment. Bai Yinshou understood it almost instantly.</p>

    <p>But he still pretended not to know and asked his own question: "Mr. Qiao, your combat power is extraordinary. Just a mere earth monk. You can crush them into ashes with just a raise of your hand."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan smiled playfully and said: "That's true. But I still don't want to do it just like that. It's more fun to provoke the ants. If you stomp them into a pulp with one kick, that would be the most pale behavior."</p>

    <p>"That's what Mr. Qiao said."</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou nodded.</p>

    <p>Of course, he felt that one of the main reasons why Qiao Yanyuan refused to take action was probably because of the boy named Wang who was hiding behind his back...</p>

    <p>It's strange. He obviously doesn't have Alzheimer's disease, but he just can't remember the other person's complete name.</p>

    <p>Now all the Dragonborn know that there is a mysterious royal family from the East on earth.</p>

    <p>And in that small house, there are horrors packed one after another. Even the newly born baby girl has the powerful ability to compete with Jingze and Yan?...</p>

    <p>In fact, Bai Yinshou felt that it was a bit reluctant for him to say that he was fighting. Although the information passed down from above was to fight, according to the gossip he got, both Jingze and Yan? were beaten violently by the newborn girl. of.</p>

    <p>The key is that the girl is not yet full moon!</p>

    <p>Anyway, no matter what, that family is very abnormal! Extremely abnormal! It is the bug of all human monks on the earth!</p>

    <p>But obviously Bai Yinshou also felt that Qiao Yanyuan had grasped the key point. That is, he believed that the Wang family did not want to expose their true strength in front of the world. It was precisely because of this that he would change his strategy now. Let more people Many Earth cultivators were involved.</p>

    <p>Now that the Moonlight cruise ship in the restricted area has been exposed, and even the show of force cannot drive away this group of earth monks, in Qiao Yanyuan's opinion, the best way now is to directly open the door and let more people get involved. in this matter.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is necessary to involve the most powerful, respected and truly able upper-level earth monks on earth.</p>

    <p>And Mi Xiuyuan Zun is one of the important links in Qiao Yanyuan's next layout.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Qiao Yanyuan also said that it would be too boring to directly crush these earth monks to death.</p>

    <p>There is no sense of achievement at all.</p>

    <p>Any game, no matter how fun it is, will become completely boring when you turn on the cheats and enter the Musou mode.</p>

    <p>So he directly adopted this model. He used inducements to get the people he selected to cooperate with him, and used the power of this group of earthlings to block the rest of the earthlings...</p>

    <p>What will the scene be like then?</p>

    <p>The Yuan Zun fire merged. The earth monks fought against each other. Then they died violently...</p>

    <p>Listen. How sweet it is...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei is driving the Little White Dragon. His goal is very determined. He has been pursuing the direction of the Moonlight.</p>

    <p>It's not that easy to find the Moonlight. Although Qiao Yanyuan's signal is right in this restricted area of the sea, the other party has still set up an illusion barrier. Therefore, Yue Lingwei is also decoding the signals in the restricted area of the sea while acting like a little white dragon. Illusion barrier.</p>

    <p>Everything was going smoothly at first. But halfway through the route, Zhang Zhui suddenly felt that Xiao Bailong's speed was gradually slowing down.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei frowned: "The situation is not quite right."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "?"</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei: "On the other side of the sea, all the barriers were opened in an instant. I feel that the illusion barrier no longer exists. He no longer hides himself. It seems that he is deliberately leading us in."</p>

    <p>"Is there such a good thing?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled: "Is this guy provoking? Or is he really not afraid of death?"</p>

    <p>He flexed his knuckles. It felt like he hadn't encountered such a thorn for a long time. Although he also knew that Qiao Yanyuan was very strong, Zhang Zhui, as the eternal man, had never been afraid of anyone. There are many ways to win. There is no one. It is said that victory must be achieved through a head-on confrontation.</p>

    <p>Saving the country through curves is also saving the country. As long as it can win, the final winner will have the right to interpret the victory and will always be the righteous party.</p>

    <p>"There is fraud." Yue Lingwei was cautious.</p>

    <p>He felt that Qiao Yanyuan's behavior was a bit uncharacteristic. From the initial intimidation, to now the middle door was almost wide open, completely exposing his coordinates without adding any obstacles. Such behavior seemed to be Tell them that there may be unknown "surprises" if they continue to delve deeper.</p>

    <p>But now, no one has come to translate for Yue Lingwei what a surprise is.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, a cannonball turned into a stream of light and came from far to near. Yue Lingjian reacted quickly. However, the sword master was always on guard. The bomb was intercepted by Yi Jianchuan's sword energy halfway through the flight. Immediately it was torn into pieces and exploded in mid-air.</p>

    <p>Then, right in front of Yue Lingwei, a scene that made him unbelievable happened. A large number of Mixiu Country ships appeared out of thin air on the sea. They were like ghost ships coming from all directions.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui instantly understood the real reason why Qiao Yanyuan left the middle door wide open.</p>

    <p>In the land of cultivation on Earth, a traitor has appeared...</p>
