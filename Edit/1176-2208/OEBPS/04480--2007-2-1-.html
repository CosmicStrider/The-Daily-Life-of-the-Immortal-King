  <h1>Chapter 2007 2 in 1. Snatch Qu Shuling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dai Tianchun's words made Qu Shuling take a few steps back. The expression on his face was a bit incredulous. He looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar man in front of him. Even his voice trembled for a while: "Teacher... what exactly? What happened? I feel like you've changed... You told me earlier. To fight! Don't give up easily..."</p>

    <p>"Shu Ling, you misunderstood. I don't want you to give up. It's the same struggle. It's just a different path."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun said: "Don't forget. As long as you don't enter the cultivation court, no one can judge you guilty. After the peacekeeping mission is completed this year, you will still be the genius respected by the world."</p>

    <p>"..." Qu Shuling remained silent for a long time.</p>

    <p>Even though Dai Tianchun refused to admit it, Qu Shuling could clearly feel that Dai Tianchun had really changed. He was no longer the ruthless, sinister, and vindictive teacher he knew before.</p>

    <p>The original Dai Tianchun was more like a big cat with its hair being combed upside down. The hair was always in a state of exploding. But now, after trimming his hair and beard, Dai Tianchun feels that his temper has become much gentler.</p>

    <p>It's like a cat that is enjoying the caress of its owner and has smoothed its fur.</p>

    <p>The peacekeeping mission is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world... even though it only lasts for one year. In Qu Shuling's eyes, this is just an incident against him. It is just exile and punishment without any legal judgment.</p>

    <p>Although he considers himself to be very strong, the various unknown risks encountered in international peacekeeping missions are definitely not something he can contend with on his own.</p>

    <p>The tasks he will face may include cleaning up the activation of the abnormal secret realm caused by the disorder of space. In order to maintain the stability of the space, peacekeeping troops must go deep into the secret realm, close the abnormal entrance, and then find a way to return to reality from the secret realm.</p>

    <p>In most cases, very few people can successfully return to the real world. This means that as long as this happens, most people will face the end of sacrifice.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling thinks that he is not afraid of death, but after all, he does not want to dedicate his young and precious life in a place like this to people who have nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>Since he was a child, his parents are gone, and no one has ever cared about him or disciplined him. Why should he learn to care about others? Even pay the price of his life for those who insult him?</p>

    <p>Of course, the job of clearing the entrance to an abnormal secret realm is only one of the most dangerous tasks among international peacekeeping missions.</p>

    <p>In addition, it also discourages local cultivator troops from rioting, prevents illegal cross-border infiltration, cracks down on terrorist organizations that have an impact on the cultivator world around the world, and supports the infrastructure construction of poor cultivator countries!</p>

    <p>These tasks made Qu Shuling feel incompatible with his personality and completely unacceptable to him.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what if I said, I don't want to go." Qu Shuling lowered his head and said to Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>"You have no other choice, Shuling. This is the best choice that the teacher has won for you. When the peacekeeping mission is completed, you can still return to Shengke. Continue to serve as the president of your student union. Become the star student that Shengke advertises to the outside world. And this international peacekeeping mission. It will also help repair your current image on the Internet."</p>

    <p>It was rare for Dai Tianchun to persuade Qu Shuling with sincerity. He patted Qu Shuling's shoulder and said, "Don't worry. There is an old comrade in the international peacekeeping force whom this teacher knows. You will not face any danger if you follow him. Besides, even if you go, you are a new recruit and you are young. Everyone will rush to do those life-threatening tasks and will not let you take risks."</p>

    <p>"I'm not afraid of death, teacher!"</p>

    <p>These words seemed to have touched Qu Shuling's sore spot, causing his eyes to turn red all of a sudden: "I just... don't want to do things for those who have nothing to do with me! I thought you would understand me teacher!"</p>

    <p>"Shuling. You need to calm down now."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun sighed and said: "You have a whole week to think about this matter. If you don't agree, the teacher will have to take tough measures. In addition, the thing the teacher gave you last time, I hope you can give it back to me."</p>

    <p>"That dragon scale?"</p>

    <p>"That was just a trick the teacher made on you. I just wanted to give you a gift to make you feel better. There are no dragon scales anywhere in this world. It was just a fragment that the teacher extracted from a meteorite. I wanted to give it as a gift. To make you feel better."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun pretended to smile casually and said: "But, the teacher recently discovered that this fragment contains an unknown radiation. Although it is not clear what effect it has on the human body, for the sake of safety, I think it is better to recycle it first."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Dai Tianchun stretched out his hand and asked Qu Shuling for it.</p>

    <p>He thought that his tone was already very gentle. And if Qu Shuling could successfully hand over the dragon scale, he would also be able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Compare that dragon scale mixed in the meteorite. Dai Tianchun personally monitored the DNA sequence. It was a creature that had never appeared on the earth. According to the results of DNA sequence rehearsal with existing cultivation precision instruments.</p>

    <p>The composition of a creature with this DNA sequence. It is most likely a black dragon with a single horn...</p>

    <p>This discovery at that time surprised Dai Tianchun. Crazy ideas suddenly popped into his mind.</p>

    <p>He pinched the dragon scale. The first person that came to his mind was Qu Shuling. And a voice told him. He must let Qu Shuling eat this dragon scale...</p>

    <p>Now, after Dai Tianchun returned to normal, he suddenly felt scared.</p>

    <p>Because that's not what he really thinks.</p>

    <p>It was this strange dragon scale that was guiding his actions intentionally or unintentionally...</p>

    <p>What kind of substance is that?</p>

    <p>And who sent it to the earth?</p>

    <p>Could it be an infiltration and invasion of the earth by alien beings?</p>

    <p>The more Dai Tianchun thought about all this, the more he became afraid.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this time he came to find Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Its real purpose is not just to propose an international peacekeeping mission. The most important thing is to recover this dragon scale into its own hands.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that the legendary Mr. Dai, who is known as the God of Killing, would sometimes be afraid?"</p>

    <p>However, just when Dai Tianchun thought that everything could proceed smoothly, A strange man's voice, not from the Spirit Guard, came.</p>

    <p>"Who!"</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun was extremely frightened. This feeling of strong danger caused his spiritual pressure to burst out almost instantly.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>An astonishing and majestic spiritual pressure plummeted, compressing the surrounding air infinitely.</p>

    <p>However, this man was wearing a black gown, holding a wand on his back, arranging his head, wearing an eye patch, and a weird smile, and walked from the door with a relaxed look on his face.</p>

    <p>At this time, Dai Tianchun felt a strong sense of threat.</p>

    <p>He looked around and found that Qu Shuling's body and expression had frozen. The Spirit Guard and Qu Shuling at the door were also in the same state.</p>

    <p>The man walked in openly without any obstruction and relied on this strange method.</p>

    <p>Is it time stop?</p>

    <p>Impossible...</p>

    <p>If it is a law-defying ability like time stopping, then he should also be imprisoned in time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Dai Tianchun judged that this should be a strong illusion.</p>

    <p>Directly causing this effect that is very similar to time stopping.</p>

    <p>As a top master, Dai Tianchun certainly knows clearly that at this moment, he may also be deeply trapped in this illusion.</p>

    <p>It can also make him fall into illusion.</p>

    <p>This man with a wand on his back and wearing a black gown. His identity is definitely not simple...</p>

    <p>"Where are you from?" Dai Tianchun asked.</p>

    <p>"I'm just a migrant worker enjoying the blessings. Mr. Dai."</p>

    <p>The man with the wand on his back smiled: "I'm far less famous than Mr. Killer God. I'm just a nobody. Maybe you haven't even heard of my name. Others call me: Mingyue Ye."</p>

    <p>Twenty-four Bridges on a moonlit night<sup>1</sup>?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("二十四橋明月夜" "Èrshísì qiáo míngyuè yè?" A quatrain poem.)</dfn>

    <p>The first thing that came to Dai Tianchun's mind was this ancient poem.</p>

    <p>However, he really didn't have much impression of this name. He just felt that it had a strong sense of strangeness.</p>

    <p>Because he had heard of almost all the great illusionists who had a certain reputation in illusions around the world. But he had never heard of this man named Mingyue Ye.</p>

    <p>Looking at Dai Tianchun's puzzled expression, Mingyue Ye couldn't help but smile and said, "I told you, Mr. Killer God. You couldn't have heard of my name. If there is anything else Mr. Dai wants to ask, you can ask him all."</p>

    <p>"What force do you belong to? You're not a member of Tengu, are you?"</p>

    <p>"Ha. Those weaklings like Tengu have been recruited by the Office of Strategic Deception a long time ago. I don't even bother to join." Mingyue Ye gently tapped the huge red gem inlaid on the wand with her slender fingers like a woman: "Maybe this is another organization that Mr. Killer God has never heard of... because I come from Honghuang."</p>

    <p>"Indeed I haven't heard of it." Dai Tianchun frowned.</p>

    <p>"After all, it has just been established not long ago. Even our young master is just a swaddled baby."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye smiled: "Currently, we are still short of a lot of manpower. If Mr. Killer God is interested, you might as well consider joining us? Whether it is provident fund or social security, we will give Mr. Killer God the upper hand."</p>

    <p>"Interesting. You are the first person who dares to directly make fun of me."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun chuckled: "And this is the first time I've heard that the leader is a baby."</p>

    <p>"The identity of our young master is not simple. Mr. Dai."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye laughed: "Because our young master came from a meteorite."</p>

    <p>These words immediately aroused Dai Tianchun's extreme vigilance.</p>

    <p>His anti-world magic weapon, the Six-Element Spirit Armor, and the weird dragon scales also came from meteorites...</p>

    <p>As a result, there is now another baby sent to Earth via a meteorite.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun is almost certain that someone must be behind this.</p>

    <p>This prehistoric...</p>

    <p>Perhaps it will be the biggest threat in the future on earth!</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Dai knows something. But now it's all over. You should know what the purpose of my trip is."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye held the magic wand in his hand and pointed at Qu Shuling: "This little guy is the one our young master likes. So, I am here to take him away. As for those stinky fish and shrimp spirit guards at the door. I'll tell you. Not interested at all. Killing them will only add trouble. It won't bring any splash... but Mr. Killer God is different. You have a good reputation. And you already know too many of our secrets."</p>

    <p>"You want to take Shuling away? And the meaning of this is that you also want to kill me?"</p>

    <p>Hearing what Mingyue Ye said, Dai Tianchun immediately raised his eyebrows. This person's strength was not simple. Dai Tianchun had noticed it just by testing it briefly with his spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>However, the other party threatened to kidnap Qu Shuling directly under his nose and kill him. This was a bit too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>Even the most famous illusionist in the world, Dai Tianchun has encountered him. He is just an unknown person. He actually wants to show off his power in front of him, the God of Death.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, these so-called illusionists are just a bunch of magicians.</p>

    <p>Pediatric trick!</p>

    <p>To dispel the illusion, Dai Tianchun has his own method.</p>

    <p>He immediately stamped his foot and snorted coldly. Without any wavering on his face, he directly pinched his left arm with his right hand. Then he pinched it hard and broke the bones of his right arm.</p>

    <p>The severe pain almost made Dai Tianchun wake up immediately. There were beads of sweat on his forehead. At the moment when the illusion was lifted, Qu Shuling and the spiritual guards at the door were all lying on the ground.</p>

    <p>Everything was as Dai Tianchun guessed. They had already fallen. It was just Mingyue Ye who used illusions to create this illusion that time stopped.</p>

    <p>"The illusion has been solved. That's all." Dai Tianchun looked at the bright moonlit night. The expression on his face remained unchanged. He was running spiritual power in his hands, using magic to reconnect his broken bones.</p>

    <p>This method of speeding up cell growth and repair through spiritual stimulation will reduce longevity to a certain extent. However, on the battlefield, this is indeed a necessary method for fighting a protracted war.</p>

    <p>As the god of death, Dai Tianchun's proficiency in this spell is self-evident.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Mr. Killer God. What a ruthless man."</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, even Mingyue Ye couldn't help but applaud Dai Tianchun: "This is through self-destruction, creating extreme pain to release the illusion, and then using the method of reconstruction to repair the injury. It is indeed amazing..."</p>

    <p>"I have met countless great illusionists. Their methods are much better than yours." Dai Tianchun chuckled.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was a surge of anger in his heart. The man in front of Mingyue Ye was really laughing so hard that he deserved a beating. Therefore, he decided to capture Mingyue Ye right here and then take him back for interrogation.</p>

    <p>However, just when he was about to take action, Mingyue Ye's figure actually changed in an instant and appeared directly behind him like a ghost.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, he was shocked to find that the spirit guards and Qu Shuling, who had been lying on the ground, stood up again, maintaining the frozen posture he first saw.</p>

    <p>The illusion has not been lifted?</p>

    <p>How is this possible!</p>

    <p>The expression on Dai Tianchun's face was stunned. He couldn't believe his eyes at all.</p>

    <p>"Unexpectedly, Mr. Killer God, the scene where you cut off your right arm to try to break the illusion was actually my illusion." At this time, Mingyue Ye's voice came from Dai Tianchun's ear.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun could clearly feel that this hateful man was behind him. However, his body could not move.</p>

    <p>The next second, there was a "puff" sound.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun was shocked to find that the wand that Mingyue Ye had been holding in his hand had pierced his chest from behind and was constantly stirring in his body...</p>
