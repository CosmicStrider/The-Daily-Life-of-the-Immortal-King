  <h1>Chapter 1372 Wang Ling's composition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is an overall perfect fit.</p>

    <p>However, because it was the first time to combine, Bai Hai's formation time was limited. After the Alluring Sword was chopped down, the body couldn't help but dissipate.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao differentiated herself again. There were beads of sweat on her forehead. She was panting.</p>

    <p>Combined with Aohai. So tired.</p>

    <p>Because she is almost responsible for the main part of the combat power, Aohai's combat power has been greatly improved on the original basis.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Bai Qiao found that it was easier to combine with Jingke.</p>

    <p>At least Jingke's combat power is online.</p>

    <p>After the sword body is inserted into it, it becomes one.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao basically does not need to move by himself.</p>

    <p>That's the difference.</p>

    <p>"Senior Bai Qiao, are you okay?" Sun Rong quickly stepped forward and supported Bai Qiao. She felt that Bai Qiao's figure was shaking and he was about to fall.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about me..." Bai Qiao's voice was thin. As a senior otaku who focuses on games, she doesn't like her body in human form to be touched by others.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Sorry!" Sun Rong hurriedly let go.</p>

    <p>"Don't think that because my lord has helped you, you can do whatever you want..."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao blushed. She didn't know why the greeting from Sun Rong just now made her face feel hot: "I'm going back to play games!"</p>

    <p>Her voice seemed a little urgent. She almost turned into a brown aura and left the place as if she was fleeing.</p>

    <p>"Senior Bai Qiao... does she hate me?" Sun Rong looked a little confused on her face.</p>

    <p>"I don't think so! It's all because Rongrong is so charming!" Sun Ying'er chuckled.</p>

    <p>This sudden change ended. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Just a little bit closer. The earth is about to be destroyed again...</p>

    <p>But fortunately, with the joint efforts of everyone, this crisis did not happen in the end.</p>

    <p>Er Ha shook the dog hair off his body and jumped out of the pit.</p>

    <p>It almost thought it was going to die!</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it survived successfully again.</p>

    <p>"What a shame!" Er Ha climbed out of the pit and looked at the blue sky in the secret realm. He couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Eh... A dog lives an ignoble existence. There seems to be something wrong with this idiom.</p>

    <p>But. It doesn't matter anymore.</p>

    <p>Er Ha feels like it's tailor-made for me!</p>

    <p>"Er Ha! The dog hair on your body seems to be greener!" Sun Rong ran over and pinched Er Ha's face. He found that Er Ha's dog head was still as soft and elastic as usual.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, you are so gentle!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er chuckled. Then he started: "Look at me rubbing the dog's head angrily!"</p>

    <p>The touch was heart-stirring. Even the monk Jin Deng couldn't help but stretched out his hands and started rubbing it together: "Come here too, poor monk! Rub the dog's head angrily!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was allowed to be ravaged by everyone without any resistance.</p>

    <p>This time it will survive.</p>

    <p>He really owed a favor to everyone here except Shen Wuyue who was kneeling and the second generation demon saint.</p>

    <p>"Thank you classmate Sun Rong. Thank you for your help." Er Ha shook his tail. He sincerely expressed his gratitude to everyone here.</p>

    <p>"You should thank classmate Wang Ling." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"I have decided to follow Little Master Ling for the rest of my life. I will only be his dog in this life." Er Ha said with firm eyes.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled. He rubbed his face and asked, "But why does it feel like there is no difference after you become a mythical beast? It's just that the dog's hair is greener than before."</p>

    <p>"This is just an appearance. Benefactor Ha's combat power has indeed made a qualitative leap. It is not what it used to be. It is no longer the same."</p>

    <p>The monk said. Then he turned his gaze to the second-generation demon saint and Shen Wuyue aside: "Now, Benefactor Ha can hang them up and beat them."</p>

    <p>"Er Ha is so strong!" Sun Rong praised.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "..."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng: "Speaking of which, why are you two still kneeling?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue and the second-generation demon sage wanted to cry but had no tears.</p>

    <p>They knelt for too long.</p>

    <p>My legs are numb!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The issue of peeking into the Mountain of Recall was resolved. In front of the desk in the bedroom. Wang Ling breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The chaos phenomenon disappeared. Er Ha successfully entered the order of divine beasts with Tribulation Transcendence. This was a good thing. However, Wang Ling knew that the matter was far from over.</p>

    <p>He had a premonition that the remaining eight Rubik's Cubes would definitely find a way to find the one fused into Aohai's body for the sake of balance.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this matter needs to be considered in the long term.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wanted to call Lord Diulei to discuss this matter.</p>

    <p>But right now, the troubles he faces don't stop there.</p>

    <p>Chinese teacher Guan Ziqian called.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows it through the phone. This must not be a good thing.</p>

    <p>In all likelihood, it was because of the writing competition.</p>

    <p>He finished writing the manuscript and submitted it yesterday.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that before submission for publication, all essays would be reviewed by Chinese language teachers from each school to ensure that there were no sensitive contents in the essays.</p>

    <p>Then, his essay {Single Dog} was noticed by Teacher Guan.</p>

    <p>The idea of this composition. Wang Ling is very simple.</p>

    <p>However, he felt that this was completely in line with the standards and the meaning of the essay.</p>

    <p>Looking at the flashing mobile phone number of Teacher Guan. Wang Ling thought about it carefully. I felt that there was nothing wrong with what I wrote.</p>

    <p>After being stunned for a few seconds, Wang Ling picked up the phone.</p>

    <p>Guan Ziqian on the other side of the phone seemed a little angry: "Wang Ling. You are really perfunctory with me again! What on earth is going on with your essay? The teacher of the Chinese language group in the office and I were all shocked. ah!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent. No words were spoken.</p>

    <p>"Youthful feelings are always poetry... Such a good topic choice. Have you never thought of writing about what happened between you and your classmate Sun Rong? Think about your previous encounter at the fireworks display in the Xiao Family Courtyard. I think you can definitely write flowers!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan worked hard to provide ideas to Wang Ling: "Okay. Even if you don't write about what happened with your classmate Sun Rong. If you decide to use Sun Rong as the theme, then you should start from the perspective of young people. Start at the level of loneliness!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Is the loneliness of young people...</p>

    <p>There seems to be no one lonelier than him in this world.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he realized that his tone was quite intense. Teacher Guan on the other end of the phone sighed: "Wang Ling. Maybe the teacher's tone was a bit harsh. The teacher apologizes to you. But I also hope that you can understand the teacher's point of view. It's a lot of hard work. A person who can write a composition like "A Grain of Ash in the Age" would not be able to produce such a manuscript."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to cry but has no tears.</p>

    <p>The main thing is. He really didn't write that stuff!</p>

    <p>"I know. My classmate Wang Ling has always been a low-key person. Maybe you don't want to get ranked at all. However, you are a seed contestant strongly recommended by the teacher of our school's Chinese language group. Even if Wang Ling doesn't want to write well. You have to fill up the composition paper after all, right?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan said earnestly: "Teacher Guan: "The composition rule is indeed within 800 words. As for your composition, it is not too off-topic. In fact... there are many things to write about the theme of singles."</p>

    <p>"Um..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan: "Then you wrote the word [æ±ª] in the entire composition. Even the title added up. There are four words in total!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling! Are you too perfunctory?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
