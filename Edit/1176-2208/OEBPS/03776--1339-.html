  <h1>Chapter 1339 Lost Memory</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Sun Ying'er returned, there were small meetings held in two places at the same time.</p>

    <p>In the inner chambers of the True Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei called Zhuo Yi alone into his office.</p>

    <p>Discuss some aftermath matters.</p>

    <p>"Jiang Xiaoche and Yi Zhiyang. Have Brother Zhuo made arrangements?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"True Lord, don't worry. Their real bodies and dummies have been replaced. Everything is safe." Zhuo Yi replied.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi has a feeling.</p>

    <p>He felt that this might not be the real reason why Lord Diulei was looking for him.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Lord Diulei quickly took out a gift box.</p>

    <p>This seemed to be something that had been prepared a long time ago. It had been kept in a drawer in his office.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun has promised to compensate our Office of Strategic Deception for all losses, and to assist in the construction of a top-level elixir experimental base and a spiritual beast training base. Although Miss Sun is not seriously injured, as the head of a sect, I have to express my feelings. She was also frightened during these days." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"What does Zhenjun mean?"</p>

    <p>"My little thought. Brother Zhuo, please help me take it there. Aren't you just going to see Miss Sun?"</p>

    <p>"How does Zhenjun know?" Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>"This is not the first day I have met Brother Zhuo."</p>

    <p>In the office, the two men looked at each other and laughed tacitly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The second meeting place is the Heavenly Dao Committee.</p>

    <p>The surviving Heavenly Dao returned to heaven with his injured brother, the dying Heavenly Dao, after drawing countless "death talismans."</p>

    <p>All the Heavenly DaoGolden Men, headed by the other five major ones, Heavenly Dao, lined the streets to welcome him.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the heaven was filled with excitement.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work this time in the lower realm." Power Heavenly Dao said with tears in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Finally completed the task assigned by Ling Zhenren." The expression on Death Heavenly Dao's face was a little complicated.</p>

    <p>"I heard that you voluntarily refused Ling Zhenren's treatment?"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Death Heavenly Dao nodded: "I don't dare to ask Ling Zhenren to heal me... Sun Rong girl was pulled out of my core world by Sun Ying'er. This was caused by my improper protection. I'm very grateful that Ling Zhenren didn't punish me for not being able to protect me. How dare I bother him to treat me again."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Heavenly Dao, the other host, nodded.</p>

    <p>The so-called no reward for no merit. It refers to the situation of death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao's rules of equivalent exchange are very strict.</p>

    <p>In the case of unfavorable protection, let Wang Ling help with treatment. I'm afraid Heavenly Dao will also pay a certain price for death. So it is better not to treat...</p>

    <p>As for the "hard work" that shows off physical labor, it actually does not constitute a condition for equal exchange.</p>

    <p>Physical work is the least valuable.</p>

    <p>But for Heavenly Dao, this trip to the lower realm was not without its rewards.</p>

    <p>His intervention can be regarded as a success, which means that Heaven has further deepened its relationship with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The future road to heaven is undoubtedly getting wider.</p>

    <p>"Brother Death. Actually, there is one more thing I need to trouble you with."</p>

    <p>At this time, Power Heavenly Dao suddenly said.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" Death Heavenly Dao saw that all the other envoys of Heavenly Dao were so polite. He had a bad feeling in his heart.</p>

    <p>"It's not a big deal. It's just a little bit of our common thoughts."</p>

    <p>Power Heavenly Dao said: "We have thought about it carefully. If it hadn't been for what happened to Miss Sun this time, we in Heaven might have to wait for hundreds of thousands of years to find a good opportunity to deepen the distance with Ling Zhenren... This time, it is truly the best God-given opportunity!"</p>

    <p>"so?"</p>

    <p>"So, a few of us talked about our feelings and prepared some gifts. I hope Brother Death can send them to Miss Sun on our behalf."</p>

    <p>"Gift?!" Death Heavenly Dao was shocked.</p>

    <p>Heaven personally prepared the gift. For a girl from the lower world?</p>

    <p>This is indeed rare...</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun has suffered in this incident. This can be regarded as a little bit of our gratitude to her." Power Heavenly Dao delivered the prepared gift box.</p>

    <p>Put it into the hands of Death Heavenly Dao. "It's not difficult for you to give gifts. But in whose name should you give them? It's not necessarily in the name of our Heavenly Dao, right?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao nodded. Then he said: "Miss Sun will lose her memory soon. She may not remember us."</p>

    <p>"Well, Brother Death, don't worry too much. Just send it in the name of a disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"Disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao smiled again: "When did we, Heavenly Dao., become members of the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"Shit. Isn't it good to be a member of the Office of Strategic Deception? Now Brother Death, you are obviously a core member of the Office of Strategic Deception!"</p>

    <p>Power Heavenly Dao said excitedly: "Ling Zhenren's 5% directional global amnesia technique. You are not included in it! You have no amnesia. It means that Ling Zhenren has fully recognized you! This is a clear indication!"</p>

    <p>"I... I understand." Death Heavenly Dao nodded.</p>

    <p>"From now on, Brother Death can represent us in Heaven and interact more with Ling Zhenren. This is also the result of the meeting we just had."</p>

    <p>"But during this meeting, my brother Heavenly Dao and I were not here..."</p>

    <p>"Follow the principle of majority submission. Whether you two brothers are here or not, the result will be the same."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Since you want to interact with Ling Zhenren, you must establish your identity on earth."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Death Heavenly Dao</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High School! Let's go to school together!"</p>

    <p>"I am a Heavenly Dao. I still want to study???" Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>"A monk who is so powerful is now learning functions. Why doesn't Heavenly Dao study?" Power Heavenly Dao retorted sharply.</p>

    <p>Well-founded and convincing.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao was pinned to the spot on the spot...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Songhai First Military Medical Hospital.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong accepted it again. Comprehensive physical examination.</p>

    <p>The test results are very good. The doctor is congratulating Boss Sun: "Congratulations to Mr. Sun! Miss Sun is doing well! And she feels that her body seems to be better than last year's physical examination data!"</p>

    <p>"I understand. Thank you, Doctor."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun hugged the doctor respectfully.</p>

    <p>"Then I won't disturb Mr. Sun. There are other patients waiting for me."</p>

    <p>The doctor smiled and quickly left space for the grandfather and grandson.</p>

    <p>Giving red envelopes to doctors is an insult to doctors.</p>

    <p>It is the duty of a doctor to save lives and heal the wounded.</p>

    <p>This time Sun Rong happened. So many doctors were mobilized. Mr. Boss Sun is always a little bit embarrassed.</p>

    <p>So Sun Yiyuan made a surprising decision.</p>

    <p>He decided to thank all the hospitals that extended a helping hand this time.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether it is inside or outside the city, as long as it is a hospital that sends doctors, each hospital will receive donations of at least two buildings and supporting medical facilities from the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong looked at Sun Yiyuan who was smiling on the hospital bed and said.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, don't worry. Just to be on the safe side, we will observe you for one more night. You can go home tomorrow!" Boss Sun held the girl's hand tightly and felt the girl's energetic pulse.</p>

    <p>No doubt about it. Sun Rong is fully restored.</p>

    <p>But he doesn't know why. He feels that his precious granddaughter seems unhappy in some way: "Rongrong seems to have something on his mind?"</p>

    <p>"I. I don't know either..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong lowered his head: "I feel like I have forgotten something."</p>

    <p>"You have suffered so much this time. You must be frightened. The doctor said that this is intermittent amnesia. It will be fine when you relax." Boss Sun smiled. Then he took out the storage bag. Place several gift boxes in front of the girl.</p>

    <p>"What are these?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"To save you this time, the Office of Strategic Deception has put in a lot of effort. You see, there are so many people who care about you! These are all gifts from them! Grandpa picked out a few important ones. There are still others. Many of them are at home. You can go home and slowly dismantle them," Sun Yiyuan said.</p>

    <p>These three gift boxes actually come from Zhuo Yi, Lord Diulei and Heavenly Dao who pretends to be a disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>"What's in the box?"</p>

    <p>The girl's curiosity was aroused.</p>

    <p>She opened the three gift boxes in turn.</p>

    <p>Then, the grandfather and grandson stared at the items in the gift box and fell into a long silence...</p>

    <p>They all understand the truth.</p>

    <p>But why. All the gifts are...</p>

    <p>USB flash drive?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Small theater:</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Speaking of which, what did Zhenjun give to Sun Rong's junior classmate?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This is a priceless treasure! A thing with a petite body but contains huge energy..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi clicked his tongue. He smiled bitterly: "It's great to have money. Unlike me! The poor can only afford to give away USB flash drives."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's mouth twitched: "Brother Zhuo... the gift was also a USB flash drive?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "What is... too?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "I guess... girl Sun Rong can open a USB flash drive store now."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "No way..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Do you think we are the only ones giving it away?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
