  <h1>Chapter 1315 Brother and sister mixed doubles</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>Huge fluctuations emitted from Wang Ling's mental space!</p>

    <p>Wang Ying decomposes his body into a black hole and devours it towards the prairie dog!</p>

    <p>This is Shadow Tsunami!</p>

    <p>But it was even bigger than the one Wang Ying launched last time against the intruding ethereal spirit.</p>

    <p>Infinite darkness. Surrounded directly from every corner of the spiritual space.</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist quickly waved his wings to retreat. He could sense the terrifying energy generated in the surrounding space.</p>

    <p>In an instant, cold hairs all over his body stood up. Without even thinking about shaking the wings transformed from the chaotic gray mist, he fled into the distance.</p>

    <p>The moment he escaped.</p>

    <p>A terrifying shadow rope struck from a tricky angle. It hit his afterimage and erupted into terrifying energy fluctuations.</p>

    <p>"Since you entered here, it is impossible for you to escape." Wang Ying looked calm, as if he was talking about an ordinary thing.</p>

    <p>He manipulated countless shadows to track the past.</p>

    <p>The moment they pounced on them, these shadows turned into a myriad of things, forming various shadow beasts.</p>

    <p>Those shadow lions, shadow dragons, shadows?... rushed forward in an overwhelming manner. They flattened the space and shook the void in front of them to collapse...</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist never thought that one day he would become a street rat who was beaten wherever he went.</p>

    <p>He looked up to the sky and screamed: "Ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>With this authentic groundhog roar, he knew that he had no control over the situation in front of him. There was only one way to fight!</p>

    <p>As the first divine beast under Dao Ancestor!</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be so embarrassed. Let a shadow be so arrogant in front of him!</p>

    <p>The marmot was alive in his heart. The next moment, the glow all over his body skyrocketed, raising the concentration of gray fog to a maximum of 75%!</p>

    <p>With the strongest damage reduction shield, he headed towards Wang Ying desperately!</p>

    <p>"Bury me here." Wang Ying stretched out his hand and controlled the huge wave of Shadow Tsunami to engulf the incoming Gray Mist Lord.</p>

    <p>Finally, he squeezed his hand sharply.</p>

    <p>All the black shadows were instantly wrapped up and eventually compressed, forming a shadow ball the size of a basketball.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist is trapped in the shadow ball and is bearing the impact of the shadow.</p>

    <p>Every extra second you stay in the shadow ball is equivalent to taking damage from Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the moment it was wrapped, there should be no signs of life.</p>

    <p>Because after all, few people in this world can withstand the power of Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>But what surprised Wang Ying was that the prairie dog was still alive.</p>

    <p>"The chaotic gray mist is so powerful..." Wang Ying was slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>Three seconds later, his shadow ball raised a corner.</p>

    <p>Under circumstances visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>This corner is getting higher and higher!</p>

    <p>Laugh!</p>

    <p>Another second later.</p>

    <p>The marmot successfully broke out from the shadow ball's confinement with a bruised face.</p>

    <p>He was covered in blood. He was obviously seriously injured.</p>

    <p>But this time.</p>

    <p>He still survived...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was amazed in her heart.</p>

    <p>This 75% damage reduction chaotic gray mist is truly terrifying.</p>

    <p>This woodchuck was actually able to break out alive from the shadow ball formed by Shadow Tsunami.</p>

    <p>Although he was beaten, his nose and face were bruised and swollen all over his body.</p>

    <p>But being able to come out alive is already amazing.</p>

    <p>"You trapped me here. What kind of skills do you have... If you have the skills, go out and fight!" Gray Mist Lord roared!</p>

    <p>Wang Ying rubbed his ears.</p>

    <p>It was obviously the prairie dog who came in on his own. In the end, the blame was placed on him and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This is a trick of the Guizhou donkey. It will be useless even if you go out." Wang Ying shook his head.</p>

    <p>It's true that the groundhog is not dead.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ying's goal has been achieved.</p>

    <p>In the shadow ball, the prairie dog consumed most of the power of chaos in order to get out of trouble. As a result, the defensive power of the gray fog of chaos on his body was greatly weakened.</p>

    <p>There is no longer a 75% reduction.</p>

    <p>Even if this marmot tries his best, it can only produce a 20% reduction effect.</p>

    <p>No matter it's Wang Ying or Wang Ling. As long as you hit him a little more seriously, this woodchuck will be wiped out in a flash.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Wang Ying raised his hand.</p>

    <p>He was ready to give the prairie dog the final blow.</p>

    <p>"You wait for me!" Lord Gray Mist roared loudly.</p>

    <p>He was afraid that Wang Ying would send Shadow Tsunami again.</p>

    <p>So he once again used his claws to dig a tunnel and escaped from Wang Ling's mental space!</p>

    <p>"Are you leaving now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying laughed in her heart.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you kill him?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>He knows that Wang Ying has always been a decisive person.</p>

    <p>So. The two had a simple exchange.</p>

    <p>"Just a stupid prairie dog. I thought it might be useful to keep it."</p>

    <p>"But I have promised Cat in the Abandoned Land."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. He won't die that easily."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Wang Ling suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the real universe, the groundhog successfully escaped.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to avoid a direct collision with Wang Ling. Instead, he sneaked into his mental space and directly destroyed the mental space.</p>

    <p>Who knew... I had destroyed a lonely place...</p>

    <p>There is a giant Buddha waiting for him in this spiritual space!</p>

    <p>Such an embarrassing scene made Mr. Gray Mist feel a deep sense of helplessness.</p>

    <p>He had no choice but to leave!</p>

    <p>But what the groundhog didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>Waiting for him.</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ling's recognition that has been ready for a long time. Give it a serious slap!</p>

    <p>"Have you finally given up?" Wang Ling's voice was cold.</p>

    <p>The devilish voice made the prairie dog tremble all over.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand. A palm fell on the groundhog's back. An unprecedented powerful wave was generated!</p>

    <p>Without any unnecessary movements! Strike it with one palm! Heavenly Dao runes are all over the sky!</p>

    <p>The space is shattered layer by layer. Carrying the destructive power of the Golden Men!</p>

    <p>The groundhog was driven directly from the front side of the moon and penetrated into the shadow of the back side of the moon!</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist vomited blood and screamed in pain.</p>

    <p>His face was distorted.</p>

    <p>Everything is as Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>The chaotic gray mist on his body has become extremely weak after being surrounded by shadow balls!</p>

    <p>I can no longer bear such surging palm power!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>It penetrated the groundhog's body from the front to the back of the moon. Under such astonishing destructive power, his whole body was shattered into debris.</p>

    <p>Finally. Bang!</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist's body decomposed. It exploded on the spot and turned into pieces!</p>

    <p>"Finally dead."</p>

    <p>Count the damage done in the mental space.</p>

    <p>This prairie dog slapped me 7 times in total.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, this is already an excellent result.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling did not leave just yet.</p>

    <p>Because of Wang Ying's words. I just reminded him.</p>

    <p>The groundhog is the first sacred animal under Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And since his strength exceeds that of Dao God, he must still have certain privileges.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, everything was as expected.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the Gray Mist Lord who was originally shot to death on the back side of the moon.</p>

    <p>His physical body actually gathered bit by bit at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>The privilege of resurrection in the God-Forsaken Land. Marmot also has it.</p>

    <p>And this should be a cost-free resurrection. No permission from Cat in the Abandoned Land is required.</p>

    <p>From this point of view, it is conceivable that Dao Ancestor Wang loves the groundhog.</p>

    <p>Cat in the Abandoned Land hates this prairie dog with all his heart. No matter how much cultivation this prairie dog sacrifices, it is impossible to let him go.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling judge.</p>

    <p>This kind of costless resurrection has a limited number of times.</p>

    <p>It is absolutely impossible to be resurrected an unlimited number of times.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! You didn't expect it. I'm back again!"</p>

    <p>On the far side of the moon. The resurrected groundhog is extremely arrogant!</p>

    <p>He was resurrected at full strength. Even the chaotic gray mist on his body returned to its original state!</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling. He stretched out his claws and shouted to the sky: "You screen-peeping dog. You want to kill me. It's not that easy!"</p>

    <p>The words just fell!</p>

    <p>The shadow on the far side of the moon is violently rioting again!</p>

    <p>The terrifying shadows gathered into a whirlpool and tidal wave hovering at the groundhog's feet.</p>

    <p>The terrifying power swallowed him like a bottomless black hole, engulfing his body along his feet!</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked in the direction of the earth. Something touched her heart.</p>

    <p>He already understood the meaning.</p>

    <p>It was Wang Nuan who wanted to cooperate with him.</p>

    <p>Let's have a mixed tag match between brother and sister.</p>
