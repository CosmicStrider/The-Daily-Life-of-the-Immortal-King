  <h1>Chapter 1665 The current Foundation Building period. Are you so brave?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are more than a dozen gloomy and cold breaths with boundless coldness, coming indifferently from all directions. The target is the foyer of the mansion where Sun Rong is currently located.</p>

    <p>These malicious spiritual powers seemed to be replicas. From the intensity to the smell, they were all exactly the same. Let Sun Rong immediately judge that these people were most likely the New Ancient that Monk Jin Deng had mentioned before. Divine Weapons. Only man-made cultivators with strict standards can have such a consistent sense of harmony.</p>

    <p>From the breath, spiritual power to the malice seeping out from within. Everything is exactly the same.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was extremely frightened. She was not someone who had never seen big scenes. But now this batch of New Ancient Divine Weapons surrounding them. Even though they were not the final finalized products, each of them had reached the level of perfection. A combat power that is close to God level.</p>

    <p>Although not at the level of Hei Long. But at this moment, there is strength in numbers. The impact of those malicious accumulations on Jiugong Liangzi, a Golden Core cultivator, is also huge.</p>

    <p>Surrounded by so many fighting machines with widely different realms, Jiugong Liangzi's face immediately became ugly. However, although her face was pale on one side, Sun Rong's face was red on the other side. She looked like she was ready. Prepare to fight.</p>

    <p>This can't help but make Jiugong Liangzi even more confused deep in his heart... Sun Rong Isn't she just a Foundation Building stage? Is the current Foundation Building stage so brave?</p>

    <p>Because now he and Sun Rong have become good friends. Jiugong Liangzi didn't feel embarrassed at all. He just felt a little weird.</p>

    <p>Could it be that senior Jin Deng also consecrated Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi thought about it for a long time, but the doubts about this question were getting bigger and bigger in her heart. After all, she herself had been enlightened by monk Jin Deng. She knew what it felt like.</p>

    <p>It is true that the strength of the physical body will become stronger after the light is turned on. However, in the face of a huge difference in realm, the fear caused by the gap will still appear involuntarily.</p>

    <p>When she was dealing with Hei Long before, Jiugong Liangzi's mind was filled with the scene of "you and me" between Zhuo Yi and that pretty boy. And the more she thought about it, the more irritating it became. As a result, she had no time to think about other things... but Now, their group is surrounded by more than a dozen New Ancient Divine Weapons who are accurate to God. After all, the situation has fundamentally changed.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is not stupid.</p>

    <p>Although she felt it was incredible in her heart, she could feel it. The sword energy in Sun Rong was definitely not consecrated by monk Jin Deng... but came from her own power.</p>

    <p>At this time, outside the inner hall door, more than a dozen shadows transformed into black shadows and appeared in front of them through the hazy window paper. Everyone was wearing a uniform and slim-fitting black clothes. A very special black hemp rope was tied around their waists. Above, they all wear a clown mask.</p>

    <p>One of them went around to the roof. His eyes released golden light through the holes of the clown mask: "My lord requires that Mr. Gong be captured alive. The rest can be killed."</p>

    <p>"yes!"</p>

    <p>Jin Yan stopped talking. At the same moment, the cold atmosphere around him shot out the inner hall. He locked Sun Rong almost at the same time!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt a chill in his heart. Fortunately, he had exchanged masks with Jiugong Liangzi before. He also used the passive ability of Aohai's human-sword fusion to simulate the breath of Jiugong Liangzi with the "Mirage Illusive Breath Technique." As a result, This group of people set their sights on themselves.</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng. Protect Liangzi!"</p>

    <p>"I understand." Jin Deng clasped his hands together. Then he took a step forward to protect Jiugong Liangzi behind him.</p>

    <p>He has never organized the action of Sun Rong because it is a rare opportunity for experience. As a senior, it is a very unethical thing to compete with juniors for experience points.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, senior!"</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng is there to do the logistical support. Sun Rong can do it later without any worries.</p>

    <p>Immediately she looked at Jiugong Liangzi and smiled: "Liangzi, I know you have a lot of doubts now. I will explain it to you when I find the opportunity later." The situation was urgent. She only left this sentence to her. Step on the ground. The whole person rises into the air. Holding Aohai in hand, he breaks through the ceiling.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Along with the crushed rubble, the girl's figure appeared along with the azure sword energy. Like a water hibiscus, the infinite breath of the sea rolled around her body, forming a sword wave that impacted along the surrounding area.</p>

    <p>Jin Yan on the roof obviously did not expect that Mr. "Gong" would actually choose to take the initiative to fight under such an encirclement attack. And when the sword energy on Sun Rong's body struck, his face was also exposed. With a look of contempt, I wanted to reach out and stop him.</p>

    <p>Finally, when he hit the seemingly inconspicuous sword wave Sun Rong, Jin Yan was shocked to find that this was not an ordinary wave at all. It was a stormy wave!</p>

    <p>The unexpected impact carried an overbearing force. It shocked his right arm to the point where it started to go numb!</p>

    <p>Jin Yan reacted quickly. A large number of combat skills were input into his brain. Faced with such an unexpected and violent impact, even though he was suspected of underestimating the enemy, he was not completely without remedies.</p>

    <p>Under this situation, a head-on confrontation would only make him lose an arm in vain. So he very cleverly used the thinking concept of "connection-transformation-emission" in Tai Chi.</p>

    <p>It looks like he is taking the move, but in fact he is using energy, a force that can move a thousand pounds. The fierce force brought by this sword energy is released from one point to all directions, and is constantly dispersed.</p>

    <p>As long as this strength is released, even if his arm suffers an impact, it will not be completely broken.</p>

    <p>Finally, with the sound of bones dislocating, Jin Yan took a step back.</p>

    <p>He used the combat skills input into his brain to resist the trouble caused by underestimating the enemy. In the end, the price he paid was just a dislocated joint.</p>

    <p>Like most New Ancient Divine Weapons, they feel no pain. Dislocating their joints seems innocuous enough.</p>

    <p>His face was calm. He just used his left arm to help twist it, and his right arm was reattached.</p>

    <p>"This person reacts so quickly." Faced with Jin Yan who reacted quickly. Sun Rong was also surprised after testing this move.</p>

    <p>"It's not that the reaction is fast. All New Ancient Divine Weapons have the same combat experience. They are like calculators. When faced with different moves, they can quickly find ways to deal with them in the database." At this moment, Sun Ying'er was at Sun Rong analyzed it in his mind.</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She held Aohai's hand tightly. A look of confidence appeared on her face.</p>

    <p>If the opponent is fighting her according to a pre-set program.</p>

    <p>Then from Sun Rong's point of view, the next battle will be easy to handle.</p>

    <p>Because after all, computer programs are still input by humans. Even if you have the ability to learn independently, if you encounter a problem that has not appeared in the program, it may be difficult to reflect it for a while.</p>

    <p>As the first person to build a Foundation Building on Earth, Sun Rong's logical thinking at this time was extremely clear.</p>

    <p>"Aohai... help me..." She called Aohai in her heart. This passive ability of combining human and sword gradually began to be unlocked.</p>

    <p>And when the breath of Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube was slowly released from Aohai's blue sword body, Jin Yan's expression was stunned again.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube?</p>

    <p>There is such a thing?</p>

    <p>At this moment, he suddenly understood why the girl in front of him had such strong sword energy.</p>

    <p>It's just a Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube... As long as he is more cautious, he should be able to successfully complete this capture plan.</p>

    <p>However, what Jin Yan never expected was...</p>

    <p>Just after Sun Rong unlocked the power seal of the first Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube, the aura was still soaring upwards...</p>

    <p>"So there are two Rubik's Cubes..." Jin Yan couldn't help but sweat on his temples.</p>

    <p>Then, his sweat beads became more and more dense, almost like raindrops of sweat...</p>

    <p>Because the number of Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes he felt was not just two... there seemed to be more...</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, Jin Yan's brain almost stopped functioning.</p>

    <p>Just before accepting this mission, he was still full of confidence.</p>

    <p>But now, even if he doesn't want to admit it, he has to say that he is already a little panicked...</p>

    <p>After all, just before this mission, no one told him that six Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes could be fused into a spirit sword...</p>

    <p>This question is already a bit over the top for Jin Yan.</p>

    <p>He even had the same question in his mind as Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Foundation Building period these days. Are they all so strong now...</p>
