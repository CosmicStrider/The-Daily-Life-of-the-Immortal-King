  <h1>Chapter 1646 Zhuo Yi! Danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In less than ten minutes, Zhuo Yi the three of them had already left the pigeon owner's shop with a full load of goods.</p>

    <p>The fat boss stood at the door and stared in astonishment. He felt like a walking zombie without a soul.</p>

    <p>His shop is empty...</p>

    <p>All valuable things were taken away by Qin Zhong in one wave, including the bronze arm Qin Zhong had just sold to him.</p>

    <p>The amount of this wave of losses. The valuation has exceeded 1.1 million silver gear coins! The loss went directly to his grandma's family!</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "Brother Qin Zhong is so awesome...he actually got the jade ball first! You are so lucky, right?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe it's not just my luck. Maybe you are more lucky, Ziyi. I was picking up trash with you just now, and I just picked up the bronze arm." Qin Zhong said very modestly.</p>

    <p>In fact, he didn't want to go that far.</p>

    <p>But who made this boss have to compete with him in the lottery just to cheat his bronze arm...</p>

    <p>While he was drawing the prize, he watched the boss next to him turn into the color of pig liver. Out of concern for the boss's health, he let go of his hand and let Zhou Ziyi and Zhuo Yi help him draw a few rounds.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that his luck radiation is too powerful, which directly leads to Zhou Ziyi and Zhuo Yi's good luck.</p>

    <p>The three people took turns. Shipments came one after another. Nearly 99% of the gray and black balls. Fifty times of lottery. Not even once...</p>

    <p>The mechanism of luck radiation began a long time ago. As the only koi carp in the world of cultivation, Qin Zhong himself has continued to practice. The passive ability of luck radiation has now reached the point of precise radiation.</p>

    <p>In other words, as long as it is an object that Qin Zhong subconsciously lists as an "enemy", even if Qin Zhong is present, the luck radiation will not radiate to that person.</p>

    <p>So the pigeon boss was in bad luck.</p>

    <p>However, this also reminded Qin Zhong of another thing.</p>

    <p>That means he now indeed regards Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi as his teammates.</p>

    <p>"It's strange...it's obviously just the first time we've met, but why does it feel so familiar..." Qin Zhong muttered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He also discovered this problem.</p>

    <p>I feel like there is an underlying tacit understanding between myself and Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>This feeling of tacit understanding is amazing. Especially between him and Zhuo Yi. They both feel this way. But they can't explain why.</p>

    <p>Judging from Zhuo Yi's always rigorous attitude, it was obviously the first time he met Qin Zhong, but he directly agreed to cooperate with this stranger. This is by no means his inherent style.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that this time, it happens to be a special case.</p>

    <p>Because he felt that Qin Zhong was inexplicably kind and had an indescribable sense of intimacy.</p>

    <p>But he didn't show it. He still looked cautious. But the guard in his heart was somewhat lowered...</p>

    <p>"I did the math. If we win tonight's underground fight. We'll have a starting capital of over 3 million dollars in silver gear. If we can enter the core area and sell this bronze arm. We'll become landlords." Qin Zhong laughed...</p>

    <p>"Heh. Just so-so." Zhuo Yi nodded calmly.</p>

    <p>In fact, he also discovered the problem of luck.</p>

    <p>Although Qin Zhong just blamed Zhou Ziyi's good luck, in fact, the changes in this luck are still obvious.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knows that he has never been a European emperor... Although his current career is pretty good. But if he gets lucky occasionally, he cannot be called a real European emperor.</p>

    <p>The real European Emperor is the kind of person who always has good luck no matter what he does!</p>

    <p>He had three orders of 648 last night, and he only got three bets!</p>

    <p>How can he be called the European Emperor...</p>

    <p>As for Zhou Ziyi. Not to mention.</p>

    <p>Obviously, he was not a lucky person who was born with great luck. Otherwise, his leg would not have been so miserable that it was amputated when he was a child.</p>

    <p>So based on Zhuo Yi's judgment, the real problem probably lies with Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>"This man... his luck is really weird..." Zhuo Yi marveled sadly in his heart. However, he did not show it. Instead, he planned to observe further.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo. I thought we were in the same boat after what happened. You and I are already a team. But why are you so hostile to me? Is there something I'm doing wrong?" Qin Zhong looked at Zhuo Yi with a soft smile on his arm.</p>

    <p>With this celebrity-like face and such a smile, ordinary girls simply can't stand it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had to be thankful that he didn't bring Jiugong Liangzi with him.</p>

    <p>Maybe my daughter-in-law was abducted...</p>

    <p>"You don't think we're friends anymore. It's just a simple cooperative relationship." Zhuo Yi's voice was cold. The expression on his face was not sad nor happy. It looks like he's angry. In fact , he is not. There's even a bit of an empty well in his heart.</p>

    <p>As soon as this attitude was revealed, Qin Zhong suddenly laughed out loud: "Brother Zhuo... you are not a tsundere, are you?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi widened his eyes. His face was horrified: "That's nonsense! I don't understand!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi couldn't help laughing when she heard this.</p>

    <p>In fact, he felt a little bit.</p>

    <p>After all, he had lived with Zhuo Yi for a while. He knew that Zhuo Yi's personality was not that tough. So it seemed unnatural to suddenly become tough.</p>

    <p>Of course. With Zhou Ziyi's smart little mind, how could he never imagine that Zhuo Yi had such a cold attitude towards Qin Zhong. In fact, it was out of caution.</p>

    <p>But now Zhuo Yi. This feeling of inconsistency is really similar to that of his master's wife Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but sigh in wonder.</p>

    <p>Tsk...</p>

    <p>They are indeed a couple.</p>

    <p>After living together for a while, even their personalities have become assimilated!</p>

    <p>I saw Zhou Ziyi snickering on the side.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong knew that his "nonsense" was probably right again.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he raised the corners of his lips and said, "Let's go. I won't talk about this. It hurts your temper. I'll treat you to a drink."</p>

    <p>Then he stretched out his hand and pushed Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi's backs towards a road.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Do you know the way? Don't walk blindly..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled: "I don't know. But it must be the right way!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Such honeyed confidence again...</p>

    <p>And now Zhuo Yi seems to have begun to understand Qin Zhong's confidence. Maybe this guy himself knows that he is a very lucky person!</p>

    <p>Luck-type cultivator?</p>

    <p>Are there such people in this world?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>I pushed Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi a few steps away. Within sight, a shabby-looking canteen actually appeared. The three of them were selling drinks that they had never seen before.</p>

    <p>Although the drinks are different, the types of drinks are still similar. Even the marketing campaign routines are different from those in the outside world.</p>

    <p>"Young man, what are you drinking? There's been a soda promotion recently."</p>

    <p>"Then buy a bottle of soda."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded. Then he pointed at a bottle of drink that looked a lot like Feizhai Happy Water.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "Aren't you going to buy us a drink? That should be spent with your own money, right?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded: "Of course. I will do what I say."</p>

    <p>Then he unscrewed the cap of the drink bottle in front of his boss.</p>

    <p>The boss pushed up his glasses. He squinted and saw the words under the bottle cap.</p>

    <p>[Another bottle]...</p>

    <p>The boss also laughed when he saw this. He took the cap and said, "Forget it. You're in luck, young man. You don't have to pay. This bottle is for you."</p>

    <p>An unexpected situation. Qin Zhong nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Then he reached out again and took two more bottles of soda from the shelf.</p>

    <p>Boss: "You have to pay me 2 Silver Gear Coins, young man."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled. Then he unscrewed the caps of the two bottles of soda and gave them to the boss.</p>

    <p>Two more [one more bottle]...</p>

    <p>"This..." The boss had an incredible expression on his face.</p>

    <p>The chance of having another bottle of soda is obviously only 1%!</p>

    <p>Three bottles were released in a row?</p>

    <p>"Thank you, boss. I wish you a prosperous business." Qin Zhong politely thanked the boss.</p>

    <p>Then he handed the opened bottle of soda to Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi, fulfilling his promise.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took a sip and tasted it carefully. The soda in the slums of the science and technology city was actually orange-flavored. It actually gave off the taste of my childhood.</p>

    <p>He looked at Qin Zhong and asked with a smile: "Do you often avoid paying bills like this?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong shrugged: "Zhuo. You call this running away? It's just a little bit of luck..."</p>

    <p>He knew that what he did was actually a bit unkind, so he gave the bureau boss his blessing when he left.</p>

    <p>Based on his blessing, the sales volume of this canteen owner in recent years should continue to break records.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I can see your ability. Good luck. But why don't you pay and then twist the bottle cap? It's very inconvenient to drink without a cap!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "On the one hand, it's because you said you won't spend our money. You want me to pay for it myself. This is of course the best way. On the other hand... open the lid directly. It's actually for the boss's benefit."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi: "???"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong sighed: "Have you ever experienced what it feels like to empty out all the drinks in the supermarket with the price of a bottle of drinks?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "Down below, are you going to the boxing ring?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded and smiled brightly: "Of course! This is an opportunity to make more money in our hands!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi secretly rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>I thought, "Who are we?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And just when Zhuo Yi the three of them were preparing to go to the underground boxing ring, not far from the three of them, three people wearing cloaks appeared here. One of the bodies under the cloak. Still trembling slightly...</p>

    <p>"I knew...I knew..." Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>She had just found Zhuo Yi. She saw three people buying drinks from afar.</p>

    <p>However, she was not in a hurry to recognize each other.</p>

    <p>I chose to follow behind secretly.</p>

    <p>As a result, I saw the scene just now again...</p>

    <p>The pretty boy who newly appeared next to Zhuo Yi spoke in an ambiguous tone. He kept saying "our money" and "our money." Jiugong Liangzi felt bad after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi...you have to calm down. It may not be what you think."Sun Rong held his head.</p>

    <p>"Originally, the original promise was just to bring Ziyi over. He brought Ziyi over. Why is there an extra man next to him?" It can be seen that Jiugong Liangzi is very angry now.</p>

    <p>"Just a man..."</p>

    <p>"That's why you don't understand Rongrong! The pressure of competition on us girls is actually huge! It's not enough to just protect against women! You have to raise your awareness!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Tell me, would a normal man twist the cap of a drink bottle for another man? Zhuo Yi is not a girl. And he would twist the cap for him... doesn't he have any hands himself!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said angrily: "And... and that person just now seems to have said, our money? What our money! This Zhuo Yi. actually dated a third man outside without telling me. He didn't tell me. He even keeps a small treasury privately! If he is short of money, he can ask me for it! He can ask for as much as he wants! It's not like I don't have anything..."</p>

    <p>"Liangzi...calm down first..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help but laugh. She thought Jiugong Liangzi was too sensitive: "Jin Deng senior. Please help me persuade her..."</p>

    <p>Under the cloak, the monk's voice was cold: "Monks, I have already seen through the mortal world. This worldly love and love. Please forgive me, I don't understand."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing that. Sun Rong could only sigh. Looking at Jiugong Liangzi, Sun Rong consoled Liangzi: "Liangzi. Don't be anxious. It's all in your head now. We still don't know the exact situation. I think they were talking about some kind of boxing match? Do you want to follow them?"</p>

    <p>"That's okay." Jiugong Liangzi nodded: "But the currency in this world is a bit different from ours. It doesn't seem to work if we don't have any money at all. In that kind of place, you shouldn't be allowed to enter without money, right?"</p>

    <p>"Let me think about it..." Sun Rong is currently having a headache in this regard.</p>

    <p>It was a legal way to make quick money in this world in a short period of time. In fact, she had been thinking about it since she entered the Virtual Realm and discovered that the currency was not universal.</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng suddenly said: "Look, someone seems to be posting notices over there."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned: "It seems like a wanted order?"</p>

    <p>"A wanted warrant? Speaking of which, there should be a reward for the wanted warrant, right?" Jiugong Liangzi's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>With a sense of excitement, the three people gathered in front of the wanted poster and began to look at it carefully.</p>

    <p>According to the police wanted notice in Science and Technology City.</p>

    <p>This is a fraud combination of middle-aged men.</p>

    <p>He used a trick to defraud a shop owner out of 2,000 silver gear coins.</p>

    <p>However, currently only the sketch is provided based on the victim's description. Since the sketch cannot identify personal information through the database, it is suspected that he is a gangster or has disguised his appearance.</p>

    <p>Anyone who can provide specific information or clues will be rewarded with 20,000 silver gear coins...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at it and suddenly felt that these two portraits seemed a bit familiar; "Rongrong, do you think that these two people seemed a bit familiar."</p>

    <p>This sentence was like an enlightenment. It instantly knocked Sun Rong awake.</p>

    <p>She was horrified.</p>

    <p>Isn't this a somewhat similar question?</p>

    <p>These are simply Li Xian and Zhang Zhui!</p>

    <p>PS: I plan to achieve results at the end of the year. Please give me your help.</p>
