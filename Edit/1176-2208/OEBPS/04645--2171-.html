  <h1>Chapter 2171 It's the Sword Master. But not just the Sword Master</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After all, Yi Jianchuan is a person who has come before. Thousands of years of Taoism are not fake here. Although his combat power is not as good as Wang Muyu's, he has rich experience. So when Yi Jianchuan deliberately arranged such a quiet place to ask Wang Muyu's true identity.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Muyu had already predicted this scene deep in his heart.</p>

    <p>It was only a matter of time before Yi Jianchuan discovered his true identity.</p>

    <p>The only thing that made Wang Muyu's prediction wrong was that the time of discovery was a bit too early... He had just been a disciple for a long time. This revealed his flaws.</p>

    <p>"How did the teacher find out?" Wang Muyu did not answer directly. He asked rhetorically first.</p>

    <p>"Yue Lingwei, Zhang Zhui. These two casual cultivators know you, right?" Yi Jianchuan said, rubbing his hanging long temples.</p>

    <p>In fact, in the final analysis, this is a kind of intuition. Through visual communication and analysis of micro-expressions.</p>

    <p>Even if a few people pretend to be complete strangers, they have not escaped Yi Jianchuan's sight after all. There is a lot of theoretical knowledge in the modern world of cultivation. As a general who has shown his prominence in the past, he can bear the name of Sword Master. The knowledge that Yi Jianchuan possesses is not just superior swordsmanship.</p>

    <p>Yes. In addition to being a sword master, he is also a doctor of psychology.</p>

    <p>"Teacher... it turns out you have a doctorate in psychology..." Wang Muyu was shocked. Because this was information he had never known before. He thought that the Office of Strategic Deception had done a detailed investigation of the Sword Master's background. The results were not as expected and there were still some missing parts.</p>

    <p>But there is nothing surprising about this. After all, how long has the Office of Strategic Deception been established? As the founding general of the country, the Sword Master is already a veteran of the battlefield.</p>

    <p>In the history of the cultivation of Huaxiu Country, this is a living fossil old monster level figure!</p>

    <p>"It's just some insignificant little status." Yi Jianchuan's face remained calm. He took Wang Muyu to a bookcase in the elegant house and turned an antique vase on the bookcase.</p>

    <p>Soon the sound of the gears on the bookcase turning was heard. The entire bookcase opened along both sides, fully revealing the hidden alcove behind the bookcase.</p>

    <p>This is Yi Jianchuan's medal wall specially used to hang various certificates and medals. Wang Muyu was shocked. Because the various medals, medals and certificates hanging on this wall are the same as the longevity locks hung on the bridge in the scenic spot. They have been This concave wall is completely covered.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's eyes were fixed on the wall. The certificates and honors made him feel like he had re-recognized his teacher.</p>

    <p>Doctor of Philosophy from the Seven Stars Sect, Doctor of Spiritual Plant Science from Saihuang First Agricultural and Industrial University, Doctor of Ideology from Beidou University, Dean of the Institute of Cultivation Theory of Qinghua University, Doctor of Swordsmanship from Yagami University, Doctor of Archeology from Mojin University, Doctor of Talisman from Jiuyang University. </p>

    <p>"Teacher... how much have you learned..." Wang Muyu was shocked. He didn't expect that Yi Jianchuan was a swordsman on the surface. He didn't expect that Yi Jianchuan was a top student secretly.</p>

    <p>The key is that these certificates are not correspondence courses. They are all full-time graduates!</p>

    <p>The academic duration of a cultivation university is ten years...</p>

    <p>What Wang Muyu just read is only one percent of Yi Jianchuan's current identity.</p>

    <p>So to complete these universities and get a full-time degree. How much time does his teacher have to spend?</p>

    <p>Now Wang Muyu finally understands why his teacher Yi Jianchuan is so important to Yuan Zun. He is indeed a rare talent with both virtue and art and superb martial arts.</p>

    <p>No matter what the situation, the only thing that will not betray you is knowledge.</p>

    <p>When Wang Muyu saw this scene, his young heart was deeply shocked. He felt that he still had a long way to go.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, you have also seen that I am usually very cautious and cautious. I am never willing to show off my experience to others. But in my eyes, you are not an outsider."</p>

    <p>This is what Yi Jianchuan said.</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a confessional.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he gently stroked Wang Muyu's head.</p>

    <p>Then I felt it.</p>

    <p>Two hard things suddenly grew on Wang Muyu's head.</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>Damn!</p>

    <p>It's a dragon horn!</p>

    <p>At this moment, even the sword master Yi Jianchuan, who had seen many big scenes and was one of the ten founding generals of the country, could not help but suffocate when he looked at this scene. He was petrified on the spot.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mr. Canghu has arrived in Fuyun Town. It must be said that this is the first time since he entered the game world of Itinerant Immortal that he has felt such a strong sense of security inside the game world.</p>

    <p>Any NPC on the road has level 40 or 50. The city's security conditions have even surpassed some Class A cities. The streets are neat and clean. Even the players are polite to each other. It seems that every player who arrives in Fuyun Town They have all changed from old brothers in Zuan to quality citizens. Every gesture and gesture is greeted with bows and greetings. It makes people feel like they are in a prosperous age.</p>

    <p>"This pharmacy... are you going to give it to me to run?" Mr. Canghu originally planned to come to the pharmacy in Fuyun Town, Panxia. In a city with a very high security level like this, Mr. Canghu's opinion is that the right to operate Panxia Pharmacy is It's not an easy task either.</p>

    <p>And I'm afraid there will be many competitors.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu had already prepared for the worst. He thought that the drug store in Fuyun Town was a very difficult nut to crack.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, I just proposed an idea. The 80-level drug store owner actually agreed directly. And he didn't charge any rent fees. He planned to give it to him for free.</p>

    <p>The drug store owner patted Mr. Canghu on the shoulder: "Well, yes, sir. You can get the right to operate our Fuyun Town drug store for free. The reason is nothing else. It's just because our city lord and general is a small animal lover. And he thinks you look very similar to the little animal he likes. There are similarities but the same approach."</p>

    <p>"Animal lover... could he... like foxes?"</p>

    <p>"No. He likes raccoons."</p>

    <p>"This seems to have nothing to do with me..."</p>
