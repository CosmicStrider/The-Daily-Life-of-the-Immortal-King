  <h1>Chapter 1900 The "Seniors" of the Wang Family</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Thinking carefully, Father Wang suddenly realized that this seemed to be the second time someone had come directly to trouble him and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>The couple didn't provoked whomever...they just produce two nuclear bombs? As for being targeted like this?</p>

    <p>Father Wang sighed endlessly in his heart. He vaguely recalled the last time when Wang Nuan was born. The one percent Fenmu Shen came to trouble him. At that time, Immortal Toya was still there to help deliver Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling gave him the Kirin Arm enlightenment. As a result, the one percent Fenmu Shen was directly pressed and beaten.</p>

    <p>"Kato-chan? And...Kitaka? Are you here?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang is calling in his heart.</p>

    <p>In the past, due to the relationship between his left and right hands, Father Wang was a little wandering during that time. He was directly dealt with by Mother Wang. As a result, his left and right hands were also sealed. Now he is facing crisis again. Father Wang does not know whether his call is can reawaken them.</p>

    <p>He shouted twice. He found that there was no response in his mind. Immediately, he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed and nervous.</p>

    <p>Although there are many Wang Ling enlightened spirits in the Wang family villa, and Lord Ma is in charge, there shouldn't be any safety issues.</p>

    <p>But now, without the help of his left and right hands, Father Wang still feels that the situation in front of him is extremely unpredictable.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Lord Diulei also paid attention to Old Wang when his family was in trouble.</p>

    <p>The situation over at Wang Ling has Crispy Noodles watching. The situation over Wang Muyu also involves Wang Nuan and Leng Ming. In this case, the Old Wang family may also be listed as targets.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei felt that with the strength of the two elders of the Wang family, Father Wang and Mother Wang, it was impossible for any evil heretic to jump over the thunder pit of the Old Wang family.</p>

    <p>But as the head of a sect, Lord Diulei still wanted to take a look. On the one hand, he wanted to see if there was anything he could do to help. On the other hand, he felt that this was also a rare opportunity for close learning.</p>

    <p>He had carried out missions with Wang Ling many times before. Every time he could feel that he was getting a little closer to the path of achievement.</p>

    <p>This opportunity to watch the battle at close range was provided by two highly experienced seniors from the Old Wang family. Naturally, the learning effect was extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Lord Diulei was very thoughtful and conducted a temporary area blockade in the name of the Office of Strategic Deception to ensure that the subsequent battle of Father Wang and Mother Wang would not be watched by ordinary cultivators.</p>

    <p>The Old Wang family has always maintained a low profile. Lord Diulei knows this very well.</p>

    <p>"Sect Master, the surrounding areas have been sealed off. Our Office of Strategic Deception has dispatched a total of 300 Golden Core monks. Under the command of 20 Nascent Soul outer sect elders and 5 Soul Formation peak elders, we have sent a total of 300 Golden Core monks to the Great Wilderness Road Section. A total blockade was carried out. It was in the name of a sect exercise...but the time was only applied for five hours. We will have to evacuate after five hours." Keorn said from the side.</p>

    <p>As the commander-in-chief of the United Front Work Department, he is one of the few foreign talents working in Huaxiu in the Office of Strategic Deception. Now he has withstood all kinds of trials and hardships. In the opinion of Lord Diulei, he is a very capable and trustworthy person.</p>

    <p>"It won't take that long. It's enough."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded with satisfaction. Then he said: "You can evacuate Keorn first. I will handle the rest myself."</p>

    <p>"That girl is not simple. Sect master, be careful." Keorn nodded. Then he stepped on the spirit sword and retreated quickly. According to the previous plan, after completing the area blockade, they would retreat three hundred miles directly and set up a barrier at the location of three hundred miles.</p>

    <p>But such an action. As the head member of the Dragonborn queue, it is impossible not to feel disgusted.</p>

    <p>She licked the popsicle with a smile on her face. She grinned and said, "Eh? Are these miscellaneous fish around you yours too?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang knows. She is probably referring to someone from the Office of Strategic Deception. Although Father Wang is very weak, Diulei has been visiting Old Wang's house again and again. Father Wang can still detect some of his aura.</p>

    <p>However, because the opponent he faced was the Dragonborn.</p>

    <p>Father Wang did not place all his hopes on Lord Diulei. However, he could still guess a little about the purpose of Lord Diulei's trip. The first was to cover. The second was to learn...</p>

    <p>Apart from these two points, he couldn't think of any other reasons.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. There is really nothing to learn from him!</p>

    <p>Father Wang's heart was broken. He didn't know when he started to be recognized as a big boss by Lord Diulei and some people in the cultivation world...</p>

    <p>He is obviously just in a very ordinary body refining stage.</p>

    <p>"You are a little girl. You have a very arrogant tone. As long as I am here, there is no way you can touch my old master." At the critical moment, Lord Ma took the initiative to stand up.</p>

    <p>He has that old-fashioned look. The curly mustache on his lips gives people a sense of self-reliance. The pure white white robe makes him look particularly immortal in such a tense situation. Of course, it makes him look very dignified. The most impressive thing is the wood grain vest around his neck.</p>

    <p>It was given to him by Yushenshu personally after he fell in love with Yushenshu. It exudes a woody fragrance.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Yan? just waited for the moment when the popsicle in her hand was completely eaten, and then she took action.</p>

    <p>The shadow of a fire dragon surged behind her.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma and a royal enlightenment spirit were waiting seriously. Lord Ma and the bed were immortal. The two oldest Wang family spirits each carried Father Wang and Mother Wang respectively. The ground in front of the Wang family villa was lifted after their feet lifted off the ground. It exploded instantly, shattered into pieces, and turned into a rolling lake of fire. Magma surged inside, exuding astonishing energy.</p>

    <p>The surrounding ground all collapsed. Only the Wang family's small villa was left alone in this area. It was like an isolated island.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has enlightened the entire villa. Therefore, Father Wang and Mother Wang are not worried about property damage at all. They are just slightly surprised by the ability of Yan?</p>

    <p>She looked like just a very young girl, but her attack was so decisive and ruthless that the ground beneath her feet collapsed.</p>

    <p>"What an amazing aura..." Lord Diulei frowned. He actually had a third purpose for coming here this time. It was to collect accurate data about the Dragonborn at close range.</p>

    <p>Although the earth has been upgraded and the realm above True Immortal has been liberated, the dragonborn's growth rate is too fast. If there is no good countermeasure, the cultivators on the entire earth except those hidden eternal ones. Few people can compete with these dragonborn with bloodline advantages.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Lord Ma never expected that Yan? would be so difficult. He wanted to take it seriously. But it was still a little inconvenient to have Father Wang sitting on his shoulders: "Old master, it seems that it is not convenient for me to fight with you on my back. You do want to come into my body..."</p>

    <p>"No!" Father Wang refused directly and confidently.</p>

    <p>"Hey..." Lord Ma sighed. His face looked a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>He has obviously cleaned up the internal environment. Because of the presence of the Ushen Tree, the inventory in his body has long been turned into fertilizer and emptied out.</p>

    <p>His body is very clean now!</p>

    <p>But their old master was too willful and couldn't get over the psychological barrier, which gave him a headache.</p>
