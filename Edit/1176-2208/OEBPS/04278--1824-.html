  <h1>Chapter 1824 The Lower Realm of the Holy Lord</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Not long after Jiuyun sent out a distress signal, the reinforcements he imagined did not arrive in time. Instead, a large number of army troops wearing gray-brown field uniforms and Heavenly Dao Alliance troops with the auspicious cloud logo of the Heavenly Dao Alliance were surrounded from all directions.</p>

    <p>This is the elite army unit from Maiko Assi and the rest of the Heavenly Dao Alliance except for the second group. They all rushed here under the command of Pei Luoqi.</p>

    <p>All the situation is as expected by Wang Ling. As a result, the three parties in Glio City are fighting here. The variety show will not continue to be recorded.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling has designed all of this from the beginning for this purpose.</p>

    <p>The scene immediately fell into chaos. The white warriors on Lawen's side, Pei Luoqi's Heavenly Dao alliance troops, and Maiko Assi's army troops started a vigorous group fight. The fight was fierce.</p>

    <p>Such a chaos made the second group Jiuyun and the six prodigies from the Uzumaki Emperor dumbfounded. They had just escaped from the secret room. As a result, the chaos in front of them made them stunned. They had no idea what was happening.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? The white warriors outside seem to be fighting!"</p>

    <p>"Then shall we record this show? Is it arranged by the program team?"</p>

    <p>After all, they are just students. Where have we seen such a battle in the peaceful cultivation era?</p>

    <p>When the white warriors under Lawen's hands were stained bright red by the splattered blood, this dazzling color also awakened the tense nerves of everyone in the Uzumaki Emperor and Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>This is obviously not a deliberate arrangement by the program team. It is a small-scale civil war!</p>

    <p>Everything is true!</p>

    <p>But... why do we have to fight?</p>

    <p>Jiujiu Yun, the second team member of the Heavenly Dao League, and the six prodigies from the Uzumaki Emperor were a little confused.</p>

    <p>They clearly knew about the recording plan for this variety show. They also clearly knew that the preparation for the recording of this show was related to the three parties fighting in front of them. Moreover, it was a plan arranged by the Arch Pope after unified coordination.</p>

    <p>In other words, the three parties in front of us are all participants, and Mrs. Lawen is just the main planner. As a result, the three parties are now fighting each other directly in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"I understand!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Guo Hao screamed. As a senior game geek, he quickly thought of a possibility: "Is this the legendary plan to kill the dog?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao analyzed carefully: "Only this situation can explain it. Otherwise, why would they fight? Think about those reasons."</p>

    <p>"I am a game planner who makes money. Every time during the holidays, I come up with a bunch of props that destroy the balance of the game..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was silent.</p>

    <p>The current situation, the bloody scene, stimulated everyone's attention.</p>

    <p>"Let's go. Lao Lin has prepared the car. It's better for us to evacuate here first." At this time, Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>The show will definitely not be able to be recorded.</p>

    <p>In order to avoid being affected by the fighting, everyone could only find a way to evacuate.</p>

    <p>"Evacuate? What about the duel between us?" The captain headed by Uzumaki Teizhong was a little dissatisfied. He had been looking forward to it for a long time. Finally, he waited until this time to face off against the legendary Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>And he was very much looking forward to fighting Sun Rong. But he didn't expect that the situation would suddenly turn into chaos. Not only would the program be suspended, but there would probably be no chance to challenge Sun Rong in the future.</p>

    <p>"The days are long. There are always opportunities." Sun Rong replied unhurriedly: "Now it is still important to ensure everyone's safety. This is not something that we as students can get involved in."</p>

    <p>She smiled generously. Then she stared at the people in the Uzumaki Emperor in front of her: "Of course. It's actually very simple to compete with me. As long as you join Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>"Gray Cult? That literary organization?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. I'm also a member of Gray Cult." Sun Rong smiled and said: "Every year our Gray Cult organizes and plans exchange activities between believers, both civil and military. If you consider joining, there will be opportunities later. If you are active in the church, you can even apply in person to the leader of the church to challenge by name."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, the eyes of these people in the Uzumaki Emperor suddenly lit up.</p>

    <p>In fact, they didn't want to be manipulated by Lawen to participate in this fake and fatal variety show challenge.</p>

    <p>But I really want to have a fair and just competition with this oriental mystery school from Huaxiu country by relying on my true talent.</p>

    <p>It is true that if this matter came from other people's mouth, they certainly would not believe it so easily.</p>

    <p>But it's different if the person speaking is Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>What is the identity and status of this eldest lady? Everyone in the Uzumaki Emperor knows it very well.</p>

    <p>The eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. The words spoken by such a person are not necessarily casual.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he saw that Sun Rong was subconsciously developing the Gray Cult organization.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could only say to himself, "Good job."</p>

    <p>Because not long ago, Sun Rong had just developed a branch of the Sun Island Gray Sect represented by Jisaki, the strongest high school there.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that now, I would jump right into the topic again. A Gray Cult branch headed by Uzumaki Teichou in Glio City would soon be established...</p>

    <p>Such organizational and planning capabilities truly amaze Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's okay to just turn an enemy into a friend.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After spending a short time to sort out the ideological work of the group of people in the Uzumaki Emperor, Number 60 High School and the people in the Uzumaki Emperor finally got on the bus prepared by Butler Lin and prepared to evacuate the scene.</p>

    <p>When it was time to set off, Wang Ling saw Wang Muyu running from a distance.</p>

    <p>In front of so many people, this little guy was not shy at all. He jumped up and pounced on the upper body of Wang Ling. He was like a koala, entangled in Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was helpless. He looked at Wang Muyu's face. Even though the corner of his mouth twitched, he couldn't really do anything to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>This face is so similar to his. Wang Ling felt that if he did it, it would really feel like "I'm going to hit myself."</p>

    <p>"Where is the man named Jiuyun?" Guo Hao asked when he saw Wang Muyu coming alone.</p>

    <p>"Ignore him. He is not a primary school student at all. He is the leader of the second group of the Heavenly Dao Alliance." The six members of the Uzumaki Emperor immediately rebelled and revealed Jiuyun's true identity.</p>

    <p>"Damn...pretending to be a primary school student. Is that okay?" Guo Hao was shocked. Although he had expected that this show would be unfair, he never expected that Mrs. Lawen would be so shameless.</p>

    <p>Leader of the Heavenly Dao League group. What level of master is that...</p>

    <p>He was actually sent here to face off against real elementary school students?</p>

    <p>Don't you feel any shame at all?</p>

    <p>But in this regard, Wang Muyu just smiled kindly: "It's okay. He didn't do anything to me either..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiuyun, who was beaten beyond recognition by Wang Muyu, was lying in the shed of the sports center. He was beaten by Wang Muyu until he lost his memory. He couldn't remember what happened just now.</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, he only heard the chaotic sound of fighting outside and the clear sound of footsteps walking towards him step by step.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect it would actually turn out like this."</p>

    <p>The person who spoke was a man with a golden swirl on his face. He was the special envoy of the Holy Race sent by the Holy King. He was called the Holy Lord by the previous Siren Monk.</p>

    <p>"The opponent is just as the Holy King expected. He is difficult to deal with."</p>

    <p>At this time, he stared at the scarred Jiuyun in front of him and sighed in a disembodied voice.</p>

    <p>Then, he suddenly turned around and stared in the direction of the bus where Wang Ling and others were.</p>

    <p>"That's where it's at, right."</p>

    <p>The Holy Lord smiled contemptuously and said: "It seems that it is the turn of this special envoy to come on..."</p>
