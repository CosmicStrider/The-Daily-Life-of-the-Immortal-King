  <h1>Chapter 1643 Zhang Zhui's powerful logic</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Within the illusionary world, the huge science and technology city is clearly divided into two major areas. The core area of the city is the most splendid and splendid place. Just looking at the golden lights over there, you can tell that the gentry is gathering there. Land is a place where you can do whatever you want as long as you have enough money.</p>

    <p>When Li Xian and Zhang Zhui entered this place, they were in the outermost block. The air in this block was filled with the faint smell of motor oil, and there were dazzling neon lights of various colors. It gave people a very unreal feeling.</p>

    <p>The two used invisibility spells to secretly observe the people living in this Virtual Realm.</p>

    <p>Although it has not yet completely touched the core area, judging from the feelings on the outside, this Virtual Realm does have its own independent civilization.</p>

    <p>And you can tell at a glance that it is the work of Master Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>Because from what the two of them have seen so far, the people living here are all semi-mechanized human cultivators.</p>

    <p>Even many shops that sell spiritual tools openly display a variety of mechanical limbs and mechanical organ parts in their stores.</p>

    <p>The only overlap with the real world is that language is universal.</p>

    <p>"Have you created another world and made yourself king? This old guy... thinks he is playing Minecraft?" Zhang Zhui smiled.</p>

    <p>Then he removed one of his right legs in front of Li Xian and replaced it with a mechanical limb.</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Don't be stunned. Hurry up and take it apart."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "How to dismantle this..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Don't tell me that you haven't learned the Disintegration Technique before? Do you still need me to teach you? At our level, don't you even take off the eyeballs and replace them? Take off a leg. Isn't it easy? We are all cyborgs here. If we do this in public, we will definitely be suspected."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>

    <p>Although Zhang Zhui's words sound reasonable, Li Xian has never learned the disintegration technique.</p>

    <p>However, both of them are Eternal level bosses. And their strength is almost the same. It is not difficult to learn a new spell.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed. He had no choice but to transfer the mental formula of the "Disintegration Technique" to Li Xian's mind step by step.</p>

    <p>Li Xian probably understood it roughly after studying on the spot for more than ten minutes. Then he also removed one of his legs.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that there was such a magical magic. It could remove limbs or organs from one's own body...</p>

    <p>"How did you learn this {disintegration technique}?" Li Xian was curious.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, it was Old God who taught me." Zhang Zhui said, "You know, I am very capable, which led to Old God lingering over me and never forgetting about me... So I took off one of my arms and gave it to her. Let her use it herself."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed: "Fortunately, I got my arm back before I was imprisoned by Dao Ancestor Wang. Otherwise, my right hand, which has been with me for countless years, might turn into a fossil outside."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>

    <p>After replacing the mechanical legs, Li Xian suddenly realized a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>He looked at Zhang Zhui: "Brother Zi Xiang...where did your mechanical legs come from?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui pointed to a shop selling mechanical limbs in front of him: "When I went to inspect it just now, it came in handy. As long as I found the currency here, it is different from the currency outside."</p>

    <p>"This doesn't seem good, Brother Zi Xiang. You are now the consultant of the anti-pocketing team..."</p>

    <p>"But this is the Virtual Realm. So what does it matter."</p>

    <p>"Then I don't care. I must severely reprimand you for this matter. Ling Zhenren has given you countless instructions..." Li Xian said seriously and exaggeratedly.</p>

    <p>After all, he and Zhang Zhui were the first batch to be released from the Corpse Map by Wang Ling. And he was promoted to captain. He has the obligation to supervise Zhang Zhui's activities in the modern world.</p>

    <p>It is an exaggeration to say that Wang Ling has a thousand warnings and instructions. Because everyone who is familiar with Wang Ling knows that Wang Ling usually does not speak more than 15 words...</p>

    <p>But leave that aside.</p>

    <p>Stealing is definitely wrong. This problem must be corrected.</p>

    <p>Even within the Virtual Realm.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Then you can find a way to buy it, right?" Zhang Zhui was helpless. Faced with Li Xian's stubbornness, he had no choice but to obey.</p>

    <p>There is no way. Because he is also afraid of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This is okay, but you are not allowed to steal money." Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>Then Zhang Zhui used lightning speed to put back the mechanical leg thrown from the store to the boss.</p>

    <p>Then he led Li Xian directly to the door. He chose to buy the two mechanical legs that he had just put back: "These two. How much for them?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly a big deal came. The shop owner, who weighed more than 200 kilograms, was ecstatic. He rubbed his iron hands with a smile on his face: "You two sound like foreigners?"</p>

    <p>"Why. Xenophobia?" Zhang raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>"No, no... our store has always put customers first." The store owner smiled and said: "The two mechanical legs that this gentleman is interested in are newly arrived. The model is Bpple12pro-taigui."</p>

    <p>"Is it the latest model from the core area?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>"Sir, you are joking. You know, the ten floors outside the core area are all outer rings. In fact, they are all places where the poor live. There is no essential difference."</p>

    <p>The shop owner said: "To be honest, sir, these two mechanical legs are indeed obsolete products in the core wealthy areas. But here in our outer ring, they are new products. So the price..."</p>

    <p>"I know. Just ask the price." Zhang Zhui glanced at the shop owner and said.</p>

    <p>"These are the last two mechanical legs of this model in our store. The current market price is 1,098 yuan. Two legs are packed. Sir, just pay me 2,000 silver gears. I'll give you a discount." The store owner bared his teeth and smiled. : "You can use electronic transactions or pay with gear coins."</p>

    <p>After the store owner finished speaking, Li Xian stared at Zhang Zhui's movements. He saw Zhang Zhui touching his left pocket, and then he actually took out a bunch of money that he had never seen before from his pants pocket.</p>

    <p>The shop owner was so happy. When he saw Zhang Zhui paid for it without counter-offering, he felt like he had killed a big fat sheep today: "Thank you for your patronage! Thank you for your patronage! I look forward to your next visit!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Then, the two of them left the store.</p>

    <p>I found a dark corner and replaced the mechanical legs.</p>

    <p>Li Xian frowned deeply. Still puzzled: "Where did Brother Zi Xiang get the money?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui laughed: "How can I have money? Of course it belongs to the shop owner."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "You... why did you steal other people's money again! Pay it back quickly!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui Oh: "Didn't I already return it."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "But our robotic legs..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "What's wrong with the mechanical leg? Didn't I buy this mechanical leg with money? I didn't steal it. Look at how happy the boss is. He's looking forward to our next visit."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Xian opened his mouth wide.</p>

    <p>This genius logic left him speechless for a moment...</p>
