  <h1>Chapter 1838 The female Taoist priest of Fenglei Village</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that the time he spent silently thinking would bring such a big psychological shadow to Chen Qin.</p>

    <p>Normally, when Wang Ling is thinking about something carefully, he will enter a trance mode like just now. Even if you open your eyes, everything in your sight will temporarily become a state of nothingness. It will follow the mind like smoke and fog. The thoughts are constantly changing in front of his eyes. This gives Wang Ling a certain prompt.</p>

    <p>The hearing aspect will also be separated, eliminating all harassment from the external environment. It can be said that the mind is truly focused.</p>

    <p>As for the body, it will automatically enter the system hosting state.</p>

    <p>At that time, the body will automatically recognize the surrounding malicious intent and enter 100% evasion mode, allowing all attacks to be missed and directly fall into a state of failure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a feeling that things this time would be very complicated, so he started thinking in this "fixed mode." Under normal circumstances, only the final exam would qualify Wang Ling to use this ability.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling ignored one thing. That is, Chen Qin is still here. And she was frightened by his pattern.</p>

    <p>"Sorry." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>He rarely takes the initiative to apologize to others. This is really the first time.</p>

    <p>When he saw the expression on Chen Qin's face relaxed again. Wang Ling felt that he was a little closer to the boundary between a normal person.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Chen Qin, don't be too afraid. Wang Ling is like this when he is thinking about something."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm just curious."</p>

    <p>"curious?"</p>

    <p>"A person who thinks about things as single-mindedly as an old monk in meditation. Why is he average in every exam? Chen Chao kept telling me. He suspected that Wang Ling was deliberately trying to score average points."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this. She laughed and quickly changed the subject: "But we are not here to discuss the exam today... you said you had compiled new clues before?"</p>

    <p>"right!"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin said as she took out a stack of developed photos from her pink schoolbag.</p>

    <p>In addition to the cell phone screenshots that Wang Ling and Sun Rong had seen before, they found that the clue materials provided this time also included some photos of the video blogger's life.</p>

    <p>"Where did you get these photos?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"This is a photo she posted on other social platforms before the video was deleted. I found it through her ID. But now on other social platforms, she seems to have logged out... I don't know if she was logged out. "Chen Qin said.</p>

    <p>"Why didn't you take it out before?"</p>

    <p>"Because I remembered wrongly. These photos were in another mobile phone. Later I used the cloud disk function of the current mobile phone to find them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked through each photo carefully. Finally, his eyes locked on one photo.</p>

    <p>It was a photo of the video blogger with a person who looked like a Taoist priest. But unfortunately, the face of the Taoist priest he took the photo with was covered with a thick mosaic.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw Wang Ling paying special attention to this photo. She tacitly asked: "Do you remember when this photo was posted?"</p>

    <p>"I remember that I saved it half a month ago. But she should have posted the photo on the Internet earlier. And this is the only photo of her on that platform that she took with someone else," Chen Qin said.</p>

    <p>"So that means the Taoist priest in the photo is most likely the last person to see her."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>New clues were obtained from Chen Qin. Wang Ling and Sun Rong immediately started taking the next step.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took Sun Rong on Line 19 leading to Qingshan Lake Subway Terminal Station.</p>

    <p>It is an area on the outskirts of the city. There are almost no people living there. That is to say, more people go camping there during weekends. On weekdays, there are almost no people around.</p>

    <p>Seeing that there was no one in the carriage, Sun Rong asked cautiously: "Wang Ling. The mosaic on the photo. You should be able to restore it, right?"</p>

    <p>"Mmm."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. Then he handed over the photo in his hand. Sun Rong was shocked to find that the mosaic on the photo had been removed by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The female Taoist priest standing next to the video blogger who looks very similar to Chen Qin is not that big. She looks to be about the same age as a high school student. She is wearing a white robe and has her black and shiny hair tied up. There is a purple hairpin inserted in it. She is holding a pink floating dust in its hand. She is wearing cute straw sandals.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is surprised. She is such a cute girl...but she is actually a female Taoist priest?</p>

    <p>If this girl were placed in a serious high school, she felt that she would definitely be the object of many boys' hearts.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand, she breathed a sigh of relief in her heart.</p>

    <p>Okay, okay...</p>

    <p>She is a female Taoist priest.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, she will have more strange competitors!</p>

    <p>But having said that, there is one thing that makes Sun Rong particularly surprised.</p>

    <p>That is, Wang Ling actually knew which Taoist temple this cute little female Taoist priest came from just by looking at the photo. This is a bit incredible.</p>

    <p>In today's Taoist temples, the clothes are mostly in plain colors such as cyan, white, and black. And there are no particular logos on the clothes. There are more than 100,000 Taoist temples, large and small, across the country...each one The names are all different. Except for the fact that most Taoist temples are located on mountains, there doesn't seem to be much similarity.</p>

    <p>She felt that Wang Ling must have deduced it. Only then did he know the identity of this female Taoist priest.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. When they arrived at the door of the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>After seeing Wang Ling, a child who looked to be only thirteen or fourteen years old but was wearing a Taoist priest's uniform had a look of astonishment on his face. He quickly put down his broom and ran into the Taoist temple. While shouting: "It's Lay Master Wang! Lay Master Wang is here! Senior Sister Yueqing!"</p>

    <p>This sudden announcement made the expression on Sun Rong's face slightly startled. After being stunned for a while, she finally saw the plaque of this Taoist temple clearly.</p>

    <p>There are two words written on it: Fenglei Village.</p>

    <p>This was a Taoist temple that Sun Rong had never heard of before. She knew about Qingshan Lake. But she never knew that there was such a Taoist temple on the top of a mountain about five kilometers away from Qingshan Lake in a straight line.</p>

    <p>A trace of doubt flashed through her mind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling came here just after seeing the photo. Sun Rong thought this was the result of calculation. But judging from the reaction of the little Taoist priest just now, she suddenly felt that Wang Ling has a strange connection with this remote Taoist temple?</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>It can't be such a coincidence, right?</p>

    <p>Her heart was beating.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the small and cute female Taoist priest seen in the previous photo was holding the pink floating dust, walking on straw sandals, and walked out of the Taoist temple with a smile on her face.</p>

    <p>"Long time no see. Mr. Wang."</p>

    <p>She took the initiative and took a step forward. She looked at Wang Ling's face without hesitation.</p>

    <p>There seemed to be some ambiguity in his eyes.</p>

    <p>After a while, she turned her attention to Sun Rong beside her. Then she shook off the dust and reached out her hand: "Hello. This female lay practitioner, I am You Yueqing, is the senior sister of Fenglei Taoist Temple."</p>
