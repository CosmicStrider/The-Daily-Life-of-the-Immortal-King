  <h1>Chapter 2095 The biggest enemy of human monks</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The situation in the restricted sea area is complicated. It can be said that one move can affect the whole body. Qiao Yanyuan wanted to avoid the battle as much as possible and scare away the monks who broke into the restricted area. But the development of the situation did not follow his thinking. He made him I felt a little annoyed.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, he still has a lot of power stored in different dimensions. And he has already taken the lead in activating part of the two dragon horns condensed into himself.</p>

    <p>What no one knows is that the dragon horn is his seal. As long as he pulls out his dragon horn, the power of Qiao Yanyuan from the different space gathered in his dragon horn will instantly converge on him, increasing his combat power. Achieve soaring speed in just a short moment.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Qiao, have you decided to take action?" Bai Yinshou stood aside respectfully. He had never seen Qiao Yanyuan fighting, but he was eager to see it. Mainly because he wanted to see how Zhang Zhui died. In the hands of Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>However, it turns out that Qiao Yanyuan is much calmer than he imagined. He is not a brainless person who only knows how to move forward with passion.</p>

    <p>"No rush." He waved his hand. So far, it hasn't reached the point of letting him take action.</p>

    <p>On this Moonlight, there are many Dragonborn subordinates he has selected, and they are all trained by him personally. If necessary, they can take the lead in resisting the enemy.</p>

    <p>In addition, the reason why Qiao Yanyuan did not plan to take action immediately was because he always kept the task assigned to him by Bai Zhe at heart.</p>

    <p>Because now is not the time for superiors. The more this situation is, the more it needs to be dealt with calmly. His fundamental goal is still the future young master Bai Zijing.</p>

    <p>For the sake of prehistoric times.</p>

    <p>In order to develop the most powerful enterprise in the universe facing the future. Although he is humanoid, in a strict sense, the Dragonborn is just a humanoid creature in the universe. He is not a real human being.</p>

    <p>But Qiao Yanyuan knows a truth deeply. And this truth has existed with the derivation of earth civilization and human cultivation civilization since ancient times...</p>

    <p>"What did Mr. Qiao say?" Bai Yinshou was also curious. Listening to Qiao Yanyuan's analysis, he felt that this person was extraordinary. After all, he was the first dragon descendant that Bai Zhe personally supported.</p>

    <p>The key is that he is still very loyal. He keeps Bai Zijing in mind every time he communicates with him.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qiao Yanyuan put his hands behind his back. He also sneered and sighed: "Human beings, the biggest enemy since ancient times, are definitely not aliens from the sky, but... themselves..."</p>

    <p>These words awakened Bai Yinshou. He immediately realized that Qiao Yanyuan was planning to disintegrate the human monks from within.</p>

    <p>Although the group of people broke into the restricted sea area aggressively and seemed to be united, the monks from various countries in the modern cultivation country may have cultural differences, historical reasons, or have their own various suspicions and concerns. There are really places that can be conquered. Too many.</p>

    <p>Take recent events as an example. The Yuan Zun of Wu Xiuguo is the biggest example.</p>

    <p>As a comprehensive cultivation country, the Wuxiu Kingdom is not very strong. It has always been dominated by the major cultivation countries in the Western Continent. And its nearest neighbor is Xiongxiu.</p>

    <p>Those who know the Xiongxiu Kingdom monks must understand. After all, this is a big country that holds whiskey or vodka and directly blasts the rift in the sea restricted area. In the eyes of many people, they have been very powerful since ancient times. It is true that if they disagree, something will happen. Will start fighting directly.</p>

    <p>As a result, during this negotiation between Wu Xiuguo and the allies of the Western Continent, Wu Xiuguo wanted to conclude an alliance contract with the Western Continent. This aroused the suspicion of the monks of the Xiongxiu Kingdom.</p>

    <p>As for Mixiu and Xiongxiu, the two major Xiuzhen countries have a long-standing feud. It was Yuan Zun from Mixiu Country who was silently taking the lead in this matter. Originally, he just wanted Wu Xiuguo to shout slogans and make Xiongxiu feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Yuan Zun of Wu Xiuguo was obedient? He would really do it when something happened, and he was totally reckless about the consequences.</p>

    <p>After several intermediate negotiations with the International Federation of Cultivators, they found that Wu Xiuguo still had not given up the plan to conclude an alliance with the Western Continent. As a result, at dawn the next day, the monks of Wu Xiuguo came out in full force.</p>

    <p>The densely packed martial cultivators stepped on the spiritual swords and formed an aerial immortal battleship to catch them by surprise. In less than half an hour, they destroyed all the aerial and maritime forces of the martial cultivator who were greatly different in strength, paralyzing them. There is no room left to resist.</p>

    <p>A large number of martial arts monks handed over their magic weapons and spiritual swords. In peaceful times, they had never seen a war of this scale. They had no choice but to surrender and leave their positions.</p>

    <p>The Xiongxiu monks did not make things difficult for them further. This was an act of sword-dazzling. If Wuxiu Yuan Zun had not been confused and insisted on going his own way, he would not have ended up in this situation.</p>

    <p>It can be said that you have given enough face during the negotiation. But sometimes people just can't shed tears without seeing the coffin. Only when the spiritual sword is placed on the neck will they become afraid. It is really embarrassing.</p>

    <p>And now, Qiao Yanyuan also has the chess piece on the human side.</p>

    <p>That is Qu Shuling, who was originally born as a human. He forcibly swallowed the dragon scales and was forced to become a dragon-born.</p>

    <p>Of course, Bai Yinshou also knew very well that Qu Shuling alone was not enough.</p>

    <p>At best, he is just a student. In the modern world of cultivation, he does not have much say.</p>

    <p>Just when Bai Yinshou was confused, a crew member entered outside the door. He was wearing a gold and silver jumpsuit. His face was invisible. There was a dragon tail growing on the tail vertebrae, and there were miniature dragon wings on his back.</p>

    <p>These are Dragon Guards specially trained by Qiao Yanyuan. The basic level includes Soul Formation. And on this Moonlight, the number of these Dragon Guards alone is 20,000.</p>

    <p>They are not true dragonborn, but they have the ability to reproduce. They are also the key to expanding the labor force for themselves.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Qiao. We have been contacted." The dragon guard walked in. www.uukanshu.net holding a magic ball in his hand.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan injected spiritual power. A familiar figure was projected in the void.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than Mi Xiu Yuan Zun.</p>

    <p>"Is it you who made the move in the sea zone?" After seeing Qiao Yanyuan's true face, Mi XiuYuan Zun was also surprised. He didn't expect that the person hiding in the sea zone had such a young face.</p>

    <p>"It's me." Qiao Yanyuan said with a smile: "This time I came to Mr. Yuan Zun for negotiation. Mr. Maiko Assi is on our ship at the moment. And to show sincerity, Mr. Yuan Zun, we I can treat Mr. Hong Siqi, Mr. Yuan Zun's subordinate, and restore his state to its original state. At the same time, I, Honghuang, can also recommend new talents for Mi Xiu."</p>

    <p>"Oh."</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun sneered. He raised his lips and said, "Tell me. What are your conditions."</p>

    <p>There is no such thing as a free lunch. It sounds like such a "good deal", but it must come at a price.</p>
