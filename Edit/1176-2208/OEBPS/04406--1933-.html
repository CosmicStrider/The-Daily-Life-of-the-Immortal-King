  <h1>Chapter 1933 Changes in Situation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had never thought that Qu Shuling would give him such a great gift.</p>

    <p>Although the atmosphere at the scene had solidified when Qu Shuling plunged into the ground, the fact that Qu Shuling returned without success just illustrates the situation.</p>

    <p>That is, the desert outside the oasis is too rough. It is definitely impossible to successfully break through.</p>

    <p>No matter how much spiritual power you have, if you want to be a lone wolf who insists on going your own way, the final outcome will still end in failure.</p>

    <p>After all, the minimum number of people to enter this map is four people. In other words, the upper leadership must have conducted professional experiments with dedicated personnel. The conclusion of 4 to 12 people was only reached through experimental data.</p>

    <p>If there are not enough people, it will be difficult to pass the level. But if there are too many people, you may also face problems. For example, the resources in this oasis will be consumed at an accelerated rate.</p>

    <p>As the representative team of the Huaxiu Country, when someone recognized Qu Shuling, they thought it was safe to pass the level. But now with Qu Shuling's failure, everyone is a little evil.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan held her forehead. Even she felt a huge headache. Li Changzhe was unconscious and had not yet woken up. As a result, Qu Shuling paid the price for his recklessness and fainted... Now at this juncture, these two people must be unreliable.</p>

    <p>At this time, she quietly looked at the young man in front of her, and found that he was also looking at her. He still had the standard dead fish eyes that showed no interest at all. He still had that imminent and calm attitude.</p>

    <p>She felt like she was becoming more and more curious about Wang Ling. And she wanted to know how Wang Ling opened the door to the teahouse.</p>

    <p>After waiting for a while, when everyone's mood dropped for a while, Wang Ling finally couldn't hold it any longer. Zhang Linyan saw that Wang Ling's eyes were always staring in one direction, and he also looked over.</p>

    <p>She straightened Qu Shuling, who was already lying down. Finally, she found a very small scar on the back of Qu Shuling's neck. It was a sign of being beaten. And because Qu Shuling was wearing ancient clothes, her neck was It's covered. You can't even see it if you don't take off your clothes.</p>

    <p>When she looked at Wang Ling again, the boy had already looked away.</p>

    <p>Is this a coincidence?</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was suspicious. She felt that this was a deliberate reminder from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, this new discovery still caused everyone at the scene to start an uproar.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan heard many foreign friends start to praise herself in English. They all admired her for her meticulous observation.</p>

    <p>"It's amazing, Mr. Zhang! You can actually find such tiny scars!"</p>

    <p>"As expected of Huaxiu, he is a famous high school student in Huaxiu!"</p>

    <p>Only Zhang Linyan's face was red. To be honest, she was embarrassed by the praise. But in fact, it was thanks to Wang Ling that this matter was discovered.</p>

    <p>After the new discovery, the atmosphere at the scene became active again. Everyone began to check their own stamina. No one found that their stamina had the same scars as Qu Shuling's.</p>

    <p>So Qu Shuling was re-transported back to the oasis this time. He was not thrown back because his spiritual power was exhausted. Instead, he was knocked unconscious by other people or spiritual beasts!</p>

    <p>There were so many groups of them traveling in the desert. No one had ever seen any other living beings. Qu Shuling could actually meet him!</p>

    <p>This just shows that maybe Qu Shuling is very close to the city far away in the desert. That's why there are creatures guarding the city around the desert!</p>

    <p>Of course, the above are just guesses. But following this guess, at least one thing can be proved now.</p>

    <p>The time limit to complete the task within 24 hours is not as strict as imagined.</p>

    <p>After all, it only took Qu Shuling three hours to open up a situation that no one had encountered before. The key still lies in finding a way.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan used Qu Shuling as the unit of measurement to estimate that under normal circumstances, without being disturbed by other factors, it should take 3-8 hours to reach the level with the life guards like Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>She wasn't sure what Wang Ling's spiritual power level was. But Qu Shuling could do it in only three hours. Zhang Linyan felt that he could do it in five or six hours. Others might take just as long. Longer.</p>

    <p>"We need to make a new plan. And whether we can break through the level requires everyone's cooperation." Zhang Linyan took a deep breath and said.</p>

    <p>She possesses the meticulous thinking of an archer and has the natural ability to identify directions. Even without the use of perception-type spells, Zhang Linyan can also identify her position through other means.</p>

    <p>So the remaining problems Zhang Linyan has to face are two points.</p>

    <p>The first is spiritual power supply. The second is how she should defend herself against creatures that would attack.</p>

    <p>Compared to Qu Shuling's lone-wolf style of going his own way, Zhang Linyan is actually better at arranging the resources at hand.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Linyan subconsciously followed the gaze of Wang Ling and looked at a neat string of ants on the ground carrying food back to the ant nest. It was as if she suddenly realized something.</p>

    <p>"By the way. Spiritual injection technique." Zhang Linyan said as she picked up a pebble.</p>

    <p>This is a very basic spell. To put it simply, it is to transfer the spiritual power in one's body to other people, or to concentrate it on a certain object, so that the object is filled with spiritual power in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>And the spiritual power injected in this way can actually be extracted. There are a lot of people in the oasis now. Everyone only needs to inject a little spiritual power into this pebble. That is a huge supply.</p>

    <p>It's like making a spiritual power bank on site.</p>

    <p>Of course, such a temporary power bank also has disadvantages. That is, the spiritual power will evaporate little by little over time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Zhang Linyan had to calculate the part of the spiritual power that would be emitted.</p>

    <p>Just when Zhang Linyan was arranging his troops to prepare for his next plan to leave the oasis, a gust of wind suddenly blew by. The leaves on the trees swayed with the wind...</p>

    <p>More than a thousand pinhole cameras hidden in the layers of leaves are focusing on Zhang Linyan from different angles.</p>

    <p>Of course. There is still a small part of it that faces Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been aware of this for a long time. Therefore, he never took action. Instead, he used hints to remind Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that as long as he kept a low profile enough, these cameras wouldn't be staring at him.</p>

    <p>But judging from this, the person who came in as the tenth group was obviously the focus of the moment. Whether it was him or Li Changzhe and Qu Shuling who were in a coma, they all had fixed shots. This made Rang Xu feel a little annoyed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Jiutian Jingmi Academy command post is outside the camera.</p>

    <p>In front of the monitor. Teng Luchen, the director of Jiutian Teahouse and the commander-in-chief of the Earth Center Project, was wiping his beard while looking at the screen on the monitor.</p>

    <p>His face was very calm. There were almost no waves or ripples.</p>

    <p>And right behind him, there was a man wearing a bamboo hat standing behind him with a murderous look.</p>

    <p>The black gauze in front of the hat completely covered his face.</p>

    <p>At this time, he had put the muzzle of a psychic revolver called Golden Wind on Teng Luchen's waist: "Old Teng, I hope you won't play any tricks. I want you to release the strongest map spirit beast. Kill all these people...I will give you another hour. If no one among these high school students is dead, I will shoot someone in your Jingjing courtyard every ten minutes."</p>
