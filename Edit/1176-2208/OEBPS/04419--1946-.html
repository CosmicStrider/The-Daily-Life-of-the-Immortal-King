  <h1>Chapter 1946 Classmate Jia Jun is too cunning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei performed this scene very well. He deliberately pretended not to know Wang Ling. Then when others couldn't see his expression, he smiled at him with a successful expression on his face.</p>

    <p>From the beginning of the school year to now, the desk behind Wang Ling is empty except for when Guo Hao and Chen Chao sometimes come to him after class to chat about the mountains. In other cases, it is empty.</p>

    <p>Now when he is in class, he suddenly has a pair of eyes behind his back. It really makes Wang Ling feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>However, if you think about it carefully, the trick of getting this privileged seat was originally decided by Sun Rong. In other words, Lord Diulei is coming to high school. Sun Rong must know.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling ashamed.</p>

    <p>Normally, she couldn't help but tell him anything. Why didn't she tell him this time?</p>

    <p>Early in the morning. Wang Ling felt an indescribable depression in his heart.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if these people never say a word to themselves, there is still one person who is extremely "loyal."</p>

    <p>After seeing Lord Diulei join Class 3 of Senior High School under the false identity of "Jia Jun", Wang Ling directly sent a text message to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The content of the text message is very simple.</p>

    <p>There is only one "?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi understood immediately. He immediately wrote back to Wang Ling and confessed: "Master, please be patient. Zhenjun came with good intentions. After all, the old vine is difficult to deal with this time. And he seems to know you very well. So we suspect that there is a mole in Number 60 High School. And Zhenjun entered Number 60 High School just to investigate this mole!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this text message for a long time. Then he turned off his phone with a snap.</p>

    <p>He believes in a mole!</p>

    <p>He obviously entered Number 60 High School because he wanted to experience the life of a high school student like him!</p>

    <p>We need to investigate the mole. Isn't Zhenyuan in the class, Gu Shunzhi, also an insider of the Office of Strategic Deception?</p>

    <p>Even Monk Jin Deng is now the vice principal of Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>Plus those from Elite Class 2...</p>

    <p>Now in the entire elite class system of Number 60 High School, almost all of them are people from the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>Sect leader, great elder, guest minister... all the positions are here!</p>

    <p>What a guy! A whole sect came to Number 60 High School to experience the hidden life of a student!</p>

    <p>It's called investigating the inner mole... so investigate the mole!</p>

    <p>Isn't this serious sect team building?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's corner of his mouth twitched. For the first time, he felt a little stomachache...</p>

    <p>But let's make peace with it. Now that Lord Diulei has joined, Wang Ling has nothing to do.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that Number 60 High School is really full of big guys now. Anyone who dares to provoke them will be punished. He does not need to take action personally.</p>

    <p>After all, even the chief security guard at the school gate is Death Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>This school is really terrible!</p>

    <p>Is it really a cultivation school that high school students can attend?</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling is not the only one who resents Lord Diulei's move to the school. Of course, there is also Jiang Yingying who has been coveting the desk behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She finally had the money to buy a nice desk. She still didn't want to give it up so easily.</p>

    <p>So at noon when everyone went to the cafeteria to eat, she saw that everyone had left. She reluctantly pulled Lord Diulei aside for negotiation.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't bother Jiang Yingying. After all, he came in playing the role of a high school student. He has unlimited curiosity and desire to perform in his current identity.</p>

    <p>"It's you again, classmate Jiang. I've already told you this morning. I won't sell this position. And your bid is too low." Lord Diulei said to Jiang Yingying seriously.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying thought for a moment. She frowned and replied: "I know Jia Jun. You have provided a lot of help to Number 60 High School. My little can of tea is really just a drop in the bucket compared to yours. So is there anything else? To find a solution?"</p>

    <p>After being rejected in the morning, Jiang Yingying actually held it in for a long time.</p>

    <p>She has been wondering whether to use her grandfather Martial Saint's name to make deals with this new classmate Jia Jun.</p>

    <p>But after thinking again and again, she finally held back.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that she is afraid of causing unnecessary trouble to her grandfather. That is the majestic Martial Saint! If she still has to use the name of Martial Saint for such a trivial matter. She really cannot afford to embarrass this person.</p>

    <p>Of course. In fact, Lord Diulei also knew Jiang Yingying's identity.</p>

    <p>He had been expecting Jiang Yingying to use her identity with Martial Saint to suppress him. As a result, the little girl struggled for a long time and still kept the matter in her mouth.</p>

    <p>This made Lord Diulei a little interested in Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Although this little girl is a tiger, she is not completely tiger-like. She is not essentially a bad person.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei had an intuition.</p>

    <p>He felt that Jiang Yingying was actually the undercover agent placed by Mr. Teng at Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>But if that were the case, it would be too boring!</p>

    <p>His high school life has just begun!</p>

    <p>So now for Lord Diulei, even if Jiang Yingying is undercover, he will pretend not to know. The key is to protect Wang Ling. Just continue to guard against Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this, classmate Jiang. I think you really want this seat. If you agree to two conditions, plus the six small cans of tea in front of you, I will agree to give you the seat." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Conditions?" Jiang Yingying was stunned.</p>

    <p>"You can make an oath with the Heart Demon Oath. This condition must be something you can do within your ability. And what you are asked to do is definitely not illegal or indiscipline. Not selling your body and soul. But I haven't thought of asking you to do it yet. So I will wait until I think of it later." Lord Diulei said with a meaningful smile.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying thought carefully.</p>

    <p>She actually felt that the price was a little too high. After all, the six small cans of tea in her hand were now her entire possessions.</p>

    <p>Now, in order to change to a desk, not only do I have to pay all my belongings, but I also have to agree to two additional conditions that I still don't understand.</p>

    <p>Although Jia Jun has promised that she will not let her do anything illegal or disciplined, she is not afraid of ten thousand, just afraid of what happens...</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, classmate Jiang Yingying, I am responsible for what I said. You can even record it. If I ask you to do something inappropriate, you can choose to expose it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said with a smile: "If I really want you to do something outrageous, as long as you take my recording and post it on Weibo to expose me, then I will die!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. Jiang Yingying started to feel that this classmate Jia Jun seemed a bit scary.</p>

    <p>But now in the Internet age, using the Internet to create restrictions is indeed a way to protect yourself.</p>

    <p>"All right!"</p>

    <p>Finally Jiang Yingying agreed to Lord Diulei's conditions.</p>

    <p>"Okay. This seat will be given to you. Let's go have dinner." Lord Diulei shook hands with Jiang Yingying. The two reached a consensus smoothly.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying has been thinking about the desk behind Wang Ling for a long time.</p>

    <p>Now her wish finally came true. And she could finally get closer to Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was in a good mood while having lunch.</p>

    <p>She felt that she had finally achieved her goal after working hard for so long.</p>

    <p>However, when she returned to the classroom after having a good meal, Jiang Yingying found that she was still young after all...</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling is packing up his things and preparing to change seats.</p>
