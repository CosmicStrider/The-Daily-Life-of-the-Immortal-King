  <h1>Chapter 1974 ZhanyeÂ·Return to Heaven</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Qu Shuling obviously came with a sense of hatred. He put on new spare clothes. All the internal and external injuries on his body were restored with the help of Deep Dream Fruit.</p>

    <p>"Anti-toxic training... miscalculated." As soon as Li Changzhe saw this scene, he realized that Qu Shuling must have conducted strict anti-toxic training on himself. Therefore, he was able to suppress the medicinal properties of the Deep Dream Fruit. Wake up early before the sleep time reaches saturation.</p>

    <p>They are all elite high school students with three heads and three legs. Although Li Changzhe thinks that his overall ability is not as good as Qu Shuling's, he still has this bit of discernment.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling was holding Yueli. It may have been because he was full of confidence in Yueli. His whole person showed an extremely relaxed state of mind. He twisted his neck and made a clicking sound as his muscles and bones rotated.</p>

    <p>"No one has ever forced me into such a mess." Qu Shuling sneered, staring directly at the three people in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Obviously, this is telling Wang Ling that he is no longer interested in the situation on the battlefield ahead. He doesn't even care about the sect competition and points issues later.</p>

    <p>Now he just wants revenge. He can regain his lost face from the hands of the disciples of the Mist God, the Arrow God disciples and the Number 60 High School mascot.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere in front of him suddenly became tense.</p>

    <p>Even Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan, who have seen a lot of elite high school students, have never heard of a high school student who can directly control a holy weapon-quality spiritual sword... If they can master it skillfully. Even in college, they can become a dominant player.</p>

    <p>At the high school level, with a spiritual sword of holy weapon quality, it would be no problem to sweep the entire situation.</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, after Li Changzhe saw the existence of Yueli, he suddenly had no confidence in Zhanye after repair. The quality gap could not be made up by repair... No matter how perfect the repair was, it would be useless. Unless the reverse was added. The heaven-level sword was remade from the furnace. Otherwise, it would never be able to match the current Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"Do you have any last words?" Qu Shuling's eyes were cold.</p>

    <p>From behind him, the bright moonlight fell down, and then gradually condensed into reality in the illusion. Soon it materialized into a warrior of medium build, with long gray hair and cold eyes.</p>

    <p>A crescent moon mark was clearly outlined in the center of his helmet, reflecting a beautiful light luster. Everything around him seemed to have calmed down with the appearance of the Yueli Sword.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan immediately frowned. They both understood that this was the calm before the storm. This tranquility was just an illusion. In fact, it was the fact that they had completely restrained their murderous intent.</p>

    <p>This is the most terrifying place.</p>

    <p>Then there was a sound of "Boom!." The moment Qu Shuling's eyes flashed across it, Yueli moved.</p>

    <p>His speed was unbelievable. It was countless times faster than Zhanye before. Zhang Linyan had just raised her bow. Yueli had already appeared behind her. He raised her sword fingers together and aimed directly at the snow-white neck to cut.</p>

    <p>"careful!"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe reacted quickly. He immediately wrapped Zhang Linyan with the Mist Resolving Technique. This was a method of changing his body. He allowed himself to bear the blow on Zhang Linyan's behalf.</p>

    <p>But Yueli's attack speed was still too fierce. Even though Li Changzhe had used his fastest reaction ability, the existence of the holy weapon level spirit sword was tantamount to a dimensionality reduction attack. Most of Zhang Linyan's long hair was cut off on the spot.</p>

    <p>"You're a man. You actually cut off a girl's hair. You don't have martial ethics!" Not to mention Zhang Linyan, even Li Changzhe was annoyed. He had no idea that Qu Shuling was really trying to kill her.</p>

    <p>What's more shocking to him is that Yueli's attack speed is really too fast.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid even the people at Jiutian Jingmi Academy would not have thought that Qu Shuling could actually control a holy weapon-level spirit sword. Moreover, Yueli's characteristic is a naturally super high attack speed. It is so fast that even the system's default defense shield mechanism is unable to react.</p>

    <p>In other words...</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the blow just now only took away a section of hair. If it had really been scratched on the neck, Zhang Linyan would have been seriously injured! Or even killed on the spot!</p>

    <p>"He's serious..." Seeing her ponytail being taken away and instantly transformed into ear-length hair, Zhang Linyan's heart also grew angry.</p>

    <p>She felt that Qu Shuling had gone crazy. He would blatantly kill them.</p>

    <p>Even if it's the sect competition in a few days, you still have to be careful!</p>

    <p>"Good guy, Qu Shuling. You hate attacking your own people so much. Are you really a gangster? Why don't you attack those elite high school students in foreign countries? Now your mask of hypocrisy has been completely taken off. Are you really completely shameless?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe couldn't help but started to complain. He showed his voluptuous nature.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was watching and listening quietly on the side. Although Li Changzhe's words were a bit rough, they were not crude. And the key is that every word was murderous and heartbreaking. It directly hurt Qu Shuling with vital importance.</p>

    <p>"Are you worthy of being the number one high school student? I wonder if you have obtained a green card from a foreign country. Are you going to kill your own people and then use the points to transfer your nationality?"</p>

    <p>"I really didn't expect you to be this kind of person! Speaking of which... you are not the legendary walking half a million, aren't you! Sister Zhang, is it too late to report him now!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Such crazy and endless taunts made Qu Shuling's whole body tremble with anger. He had never seen such a hateful person.</p>

    <p>"Shut up, you!"</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's perspective, at that moment, Qu Shuling was really anxious. He was made red-eyed by Li Changzhe on the spot.</p>

    <p>The differentiated Moonlight Warrior behind him also moved more fiercely than before. He began to cut at Li Changzhe desperately at all costs. Endless sword lights and sword shadows came towards Li Changzhe. It was so dazzling that people could not tell the authenticity of the sword shadows and action trajectories.</p>

    <p>It seems like the sarcasm is going too far...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was puzzled. He had only used half of his skills. God knew that Qu Shuling's ability to withstand pressure was so poor.</p>

    <p>Such an offensive made him very nervous. He almost subconsciously used Zhanye to resist. However, the shadow of the sword in the sky made him feel desperate at this moment...</p>

    <p>This is an attack with no blind spots. Even if you use the Mist Resolving Technique, you will be severely damaged by such a cold sword energy.</p>

    <p>However, something unexpected happened.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the thousands of sword shadows of Moonlight Warrior's "Thunder Moon Sword" fell densely like raindrops, Zhanye's black shield with no blind spots rushed in. Li Changzhe, who turned into a solid eggshell with no blind spots, Zhang Linyan and Wang Ling were wrapped in it.</p>

    <p>These dense moonlight sword shadows turned the black shield into a hedgehog on the spot.</p>

    <p>Then, the black shield began to rotate while visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, there was a bang!</p>

    <p>The sword shadows inserted into the black shield were all bounced back!</p>

    <p>After a period of deathly silence in the entire Jiutian Jingmi courtyard.</p>

    <p>After a long time, Teng Luchen finally uttered a slightly trembling voice due to excitement: "This is... Old Yi's Kaitian Sword Technique? When did he accept a disciple..."</p>
