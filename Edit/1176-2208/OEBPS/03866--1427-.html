  <h1>Chapter 1427 Sun Rong Domain Reappears</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A female sword spirit with short white hair, wearing a navel-baring leather vest and sexy leather shorts. She wielded a large green sword and slashed at Sun Rong while making faces.</p>

    <p>The name of this female sword spirit is Liang Feng. She lives up to her name and is dressed very coolly.</p>

    <p>The "Ghost Face Sword Technique" with a "taunting effect" is one of her ultimate moves.</p>

    <p>This kind of swordsmanship has a facial illusion effect. If you look at it, it will arouse the desire for anger.</p>

    <p>And in the process of fighting, being provoked is actually a taboo.</p>

    <p>Because anger can affect a person's normal judgment, leading to mistakes.</p>

    <p>However, Aohai's sword energy is extremely strong. When faced with such illusions, the ability to "moisten things silently" is activated.</p>

    <p>When the sword energy is emitted, all illusions are seen through.</p>

    <p>Liang Feng's Grimace Sword Technique had no effect at all in front of Sun Rong. It was like a punch hitting cotton.</p>

    <p>Looking at the female sword spirit who was slashing at him while making faces at him, Sun Rong fell into a brief silence.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, if you see this grimace, you will definitely be angry.</p>

    <p>But because the Grimace Sword Technique failed, Liang Feng made a funny face. It looked more like being cute... very Q! It felt like he wanted to pinch his face!</p>

    <p>Then at this moment. Sun Rong suddenly woke up.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this is the legendary... light speed QA!?</p>

    <p>Facing Liang Feng's attack, Sun Rong quickly used his sword at a low level. Aohai's sword energy was deeper than Liang Feng imagined.</p>

    <p>The moment the sword blades collided, she felt that all her strength was like a mud cow entering the sea. It was swallowed up by Aohai's boundless angry sea sword energy.</p>

    <p>Then, there was a strong counterattack force, which completely ejected Liang Feng.</p>

    <p>"careful!"</p>

    <p>Although the girl said some outrageous things to her at first, the girl didn't take it to heart. Instead, she was worried about Liang Feng's comfort.</p>

    <p>The moment Liang Feng flew out upside down.</p>

    <p>She felt that the sword energy counterattacked by Aohai was like a soil plowing tractor hitting head-on at high speed.</p>

    <p>Just when Liang Feng thought he was going to be seriously injured and eliminated.</p>

    <p>The originally extremely ferocious sword energy instantly disintegrated in the middle and turned into a gentle force that supported her waist and placed her firmly on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I was too strong." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She felt that she did not have good control over Aohai's power. The game was a game. But the girl did not want to seriously injure the sword spirit here.</p>

    <p>"Repaying evil with kindness? As expected of the Sun Rong girl. But this is a competition... the sword has no eyes." At the judging table, Jiu You shook his head. He felt that the girl seemed a little too naive.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, a surprising scene happened.</p>

    <p>While Sun Rong was speaking, another sword energy sneaked up from behind her.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Liang Feng rushed over and pushed Sun Rong away. He then fought with the owner of the sword energy.</p>

    <p>"Bang!" There was a sound. After the sound of sword blades touching, the two figures that collided in the void quickly separated.</p>

    <p>"Sneak attack from behind. What the hell!" the irritable Liang Feng yelled. He didn't look like a girl at all.</p>

    <p>"You clearly didn't have to save me just now." Sun Rong looked at Liang Feng's back and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Liang Feng tilted his head, with a slight blush on his face: "Humph! Who wants to save you! I just don't want to give my prey to others!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Liang Feng collided with another sword energy attacking Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I'm so annoyed. Why are you always staring at my prey!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Liang Feng held a big sword in his hand and roared angrily: "Then I will kill you all! Go and kill my prey!"</p>

    <p>The roar was loud. But Sun Rong could clearly feel that the hostility on Liang Feng's body had completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Damn it! You actually lost a sword spirit just like this..."</p>

    <p>At the judging table, Mo Yu couldn't help but scream. He began to realize what was different about the "Miss Sun" in front of him.</p>

    <p>"This is... Sun Rong field..." In the Tianzihao room. Er Ha looked at this similar scene. He felt that he recalled a lot of things.</p>

    <p>The essence of the Sun Rong field. It is a kind of self-contained strategy, the power to capture people's hearts. This kind of power generally only works on passers-by. But the effect will weaken over time.</p>

    <p>Now with the blessing of Aohai sword energy, Er Ha was surprised to find that this Sun Rong field seems to have been upgraded. It can automatically increase the favorability of people around it and guide them!</p>

    <p>It was just a move. The girl lost a sword spirit in the strategy. This made Er Ha a little stunned.</p>

    <p>In Er Ha's opinion, Sun Rong has an incredible power...</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. The power of the field is still too weak. At least for Little Master Ling, it is far from enough." At this time, Er Ha looked at the picture transmitted on the screen and fell into thought.</p>

    <p>And in the sword fighting field, it relies on the favorability blessing effect brought by the "Sun Rong field."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong There seems to be a lot of friendly forces here.</p>

    <p>At first, the sword spirits of the king group clamored to form an alliance to eliminate Sun Rong. In the end, they formed an alliance to protect Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Of course. The two actors Wu Jin and Lao Man also contributed a lot to why it went so smoothly.</p>

    <p>They followed Sun Rong and repeated the same trick. It was still the same trick they used on Liang Feng before.</p>

    <p>Pretend to attack Sun Rong from behind. Then induce the sword spirits protected by the girl to take the initiative to help.</p>

    <p>"Ah! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it! The sword energy was a little stronger. Will it hurt?"</p>

    <p>"Be careful! It's shameless to attack from behind!"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to help you! I just can't stand their dirty tricks!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I almost seriously injured you."</p>

    <p>"Hey! Someone is attacking you from behind. Get out of the way! Let me go!"</p>

    <p>"Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to help you. I'm just an upright spiritual sword!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the sword fighting field. These three magical strategies have been repeated many times.</p>

    <p>Then, more and more sword spirits joined Sun Rong's alliance camp sequence inexplicably...</p>

    <p>"What the hell is going on! Why are so many people starting to help this human girl!" Many onlookers in the spectator seats stomped their feet in anger.</p>

    <p>Most of them bet their money on other promising sword spirits from the king group. They spent a huge price.</p>

    <p>Some even went bankrupt and invested all their finances in gambling near this Sword conference.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. In less than ten minutes after the competition in the king group started, one-third of the sword spirits had already been conquered and automatically joined the "Guardian Sun Rong camp."</p>

    <p>Wu Jin and Lao Man looked at the angry sword spirits in the spectator seats and sneered in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Oh!</p>

    <p>Betting on dogs will lead to a happy death!</p>

    <p>By the end, 70% of the King's Group Spirit Swords in the field had been captured by the girls.</p>

    <p>This game looks like there is no suspense.</p>

    <p>However. In room Number 2 of Tianzi.</p>

    <p>The expression on Wang Ling's face never relaxed.</p>

    <p>He could feel that the people from the infinite galaxy were about to take action...</p>
