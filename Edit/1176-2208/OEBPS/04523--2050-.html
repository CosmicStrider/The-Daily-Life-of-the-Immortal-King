  <h1>Chapter 2050 Restoring the Sun Family's Ancestral Land</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Powerful spiritual energy leaked from the depths of the Sun family's ancestral land. Due to the passive ability blessing of the integration of man and sword. In addition, the understanding of Wang Ling's spiritual power... Sun Rong is not difficult to detect. A fierce battle is taking place within the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>She was still a little uneasy. After all, this was the ancestral land of the Sun family. If the ancestral land was cleared with one click, it would directly offend the entire Sun family ancestors.</p>

    <p>The Immortal Zhenyuan who came after hearing the news arrived at the scene at the same time as Zhuo Yi. Zhuo Yi used Wang Ling's "Shared King's Eyes" to perform a simplified version of the "Great Rewind Technique" ."</p>

    <p>Due to the fact that Wang Ling's vision was temporarily damaged at this time, the large rewind technique could originally restore the 800k quality projection image. Now it is only 360p.</p>

    <p>However, even in the face of such a blurry picture, Zhenyuan Immortal still expressed confidence after careful observation: "Miss Rong, don't worry. I have a lot of experience in repairing the terrain. I can guarantee that it will be perfect." Restoration. No flaws exposed."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi also comforted him: "Yes, junior sister Sun Rong. I think there will be no problem. Just rest assured."</p>

    <p>In fact, he really wanted to call Mrs. Sun Rong. But Sun Yiyuan is here now. If the old gentleman wakes up and hears him shouting, it will be very troublesome to explain.</p>

    <p>Although joking with Sun Rong has become a habit of almost everyone in the core team of Office of Strategic Deception. But sometimes even joking has its own occasion.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi can clearly feel that Sun Rong is extremely anxious now. So this is no time to joke.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what his master had done in the Sun family's ancestral land, judging from the spiritual energy fluctuations, the movement there was probably not small at all.</p>

    <p>"If the terrain inside is damaged, master will definitely tell me. But for now, there are no further repair instructions. So I think Sun Rong junior sister doesn't have to worry too much."</p>

    <p>"I hope so..." Sun Rong couldn't laugh or cry: "Speaking of which, is Senior Zhenyuan really okay?"</p>

    <p>"No problem. It's just a matter of repairing this big crack to restore it to what it was before."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal said, starting to further prepare for the repair operation.</p>

    <p>He first condensed a spiritual power ball in his palm. Then he condensed it suddenly with a loud roar. The spiritual power ball immediately turned into the shape of an electric drill.</p>

    <p>I saw Zhenyuan Immortal suddenly throw it into the air. This spiritual power drill formed by condensing his own spiritual power immediately took out a space hole at a specific location in the void.</p>

    <p>This space hole was specially opened.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal's movements were very skillful. Then he took out a white lantern and lit the candle wick inside. The gauze paper of the white lantern was immediately filled up. Then it began to slowly float into the void. Follow the The space hole that was made floated out.</p>

    <p>Just below the white lantern, there was a silver wire connected that was invisible to the naked eye. Zhenyuan Immortal was seen holding the silver wire and linking it directly to the tablet device he took out immediately.</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhenyuan. This is..." Sun Rong looked a little confused.</p>

    <p>"Oh. It's okay. After all, this is the ancestral land of the Sun family. And it is still in the belly of a whale. There is no Internet. So the series of actions just now are just to connect to the Internet smoothly." Zhenyuan Immortal said as he started to take out the electronic pen. Start drawing directly on the all-in-one tablet device in front of you.</p>

    <p>Based on the 360p ultra-low-definition picture fed back by the "Great Rewind Technique" he just saw, and combined with his own brainstorming, he actually started to use direct hand-drawing to build a complete, unspoiled image in the device. The original appearance of Ice Purgatory.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi were completely shocked when they saw this.</p>

    <p>It was the first time for them to watch Zhenyuan Immortal constructing a map up close.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the most primitive process still involves setting up and modeling by hand drawing?</p>

    <p>Didn't you start it directly?</p>

    <p>The two people were deeply shocked by the operation of Zhenyuan Immortal. They always thought that designing or repairing maps was just a simple spell game for Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect there to be such complicated and profound operations here.</p>

    <p>Faced with the surprised reactions of Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi, the expression on Zhenyuan Immortal's face was also quite calm: "You two don't have to be too surprised. This is just an immature skill. Map modelers in the world of cultivation are too expensive. So I taught myself how to draw."</p>

    <p>"And the maps below are all constructed on alien planets. They are relatively private things in nature. Therefore, it is very important to choose to draw the prototype by yourself. Of course, sometimes in order to meet the deadline, the map will be broken into pieces appropriately. The puzzle form is outsourced to other map builders. Because they are all fragments, the price is often very cheap."</p>

    <p>"Is this the purpose of Senior Zhenyuan's networking? But this restored scene involves the ancestral land of the Sun family of Sun Rong's junior schoolmate. Even if it is cut into pieces, wouldn't it be leaked..."</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Fellow Daoist, you can rest assured. There won't be any problems." Zhenyuan Immortal said with a smile: "In fact, the map builders currently used to draw outsourced maps are all clones constructed by the clone technique."</p>

    <p>"Clone... Clone..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiThe corners of his mouth twitched: "That's okay..."</p>

    <p>"Clones are the cheapest labor force. They can help complete many things. If you really can't hold on anymore, just disintegrate. Anyway, as long as the main body uses enough spiritual power, you can summon a new clone at any time to continue working."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal sighed and said: "In order to build a second planet suitable for human cultivators to migrate to, I am trying to reconstruct Drought Star. It took ten thousand clones!"</p>

    <p>"So, wouldn't it be easy to make animations? Ten thousand clones. The construction period will be greatly shortened!" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course. This is equivalent to 10,000 original painters working at the same time. And the level of the clones is the same as the main body. The quality is very stable. The experience accumulated by each clone in the painting process will also be gained when it disintegrates. Also That is to say, the level of painting will continue to improve."</p>

    <p>"As expected of a senior! It's really easy to make animations according to the methods of seniors.!"</p>

    <p>How about waiting for Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong to finish being surprised. The ten thousand clones of Zhenyuan Immortal have already passed the prototype of the map drawn by Zhenyuan Immortal himself. The complete version of Ice Purgatory The hand-drawn manuscript is transferred to the device.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong girl, look at the ice purgatory in the ancestral land of the Sun family. Is it like this?" Then, he showed his results to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"It seems..." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, this three-dimensional hand-drawn map modeling draft is already very detailed. At first glance, it looks like ice purgatory.</p>

    <p>But this was the first time that the Sun family's ancestral land Sun Rong had grown up so big. She was not very familiar with the map inside. After all, she could not verify the details.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong also knows. Now there is no other way in this situation.</p>

    <p>She immediately bowed and said to Zhenyuan Immortal: "Thank you for your hard work, Senior Zhenyuan. I owe everything to you, Senior. Please repair it according to the design of the current drawings!"</p>
