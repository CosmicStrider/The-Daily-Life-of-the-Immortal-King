  <h1>Chapter 1782 Office of Strategic Deception has a beautiful girl</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the Wisdom Tree, news about the defeat of Master Haiyao Jushi soon came out. The Eight-Star Tengu, nicknamed Ba Ye, told everyone present the instructions passed down from the peak.</p>

    <p>For a moment, everyone seemed a little disheartened. They thought that the plan to split the Office of Strategic Deception would go smoothly. Who knew that such an inexplicable and previously unheard-of master would appear outside the meeting.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Wang Piaoliang's appearance was an accident. It was Cheng Yaojin who came out halfway and stood in the way, breaking all the plans that the Tengu tried to implement.</p>

    <p>"Senior Haiyao Jushi, was defeated by that Wang Piaoliang."</p>

    <p>"It's her again..."</p>

    <p>"What is the origin of this woman? Where did she come from?"</p>

    <p>"Based on the reliable information provided by Emperor Zun and the combat records of Haiyao Jushi. The current information that can be determined is that this person is called Wang Piaoliang, an elder from the Office of Strategic Deception. It is very likely that she is the same as Emperor Zun and Haiyao Jushi. They are both Eternal Ones. In the Eternal Period, they were called the Blood Lotus Female Butcher." Master Ba said.</p>

    <p>"Blood Lotus Female Butcher?!" At the scene, all the Tengu were in an uproar. No one expected that this Wang Piaoliang was actually an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>But thinking about it carefully, it seems that this is the only explanation that can explain why Wang Piaoliang has the strength to defeat Haiyao Jushi, who is also the Eternal One.</p>

    <p>The true combat power of these Eternals is far beyond the conceptual scope of cultivators on Earth. They are existences that can easily use the planet as a bowling ball.</p>

    <p>The reason why the Tengu have been able to grow and develop unscrupulously over the years is because everyone has full confidence in their hearts. They know that behind them there is a big boss, the Eternal One, who far exceeds the actual level of the earth's cultivators.</p>

    <p>And Haiyao Jushi is an Eternal One that they know well and the Emperor knows well.</p>

    <p>A Five-Star Tengu said: "It seems that everything can be explained now. I asked why this Office of Strategic Deception can form such a big development trend in a short period of time. It turns out that there is an Eternal One behind it."</p>

    <p>Ba Ye crossed his fingers and held his chin: "You are wrong. The background behind the Office of Strategic Deception is probably deeper than we imagined."</p>

    <p>"What does this mean?"</p>

    <p>"According to what Senior Haiyao Jushi said, unless there is great benefit, it is impossible for the proud Eternal One to stoop to work under the hands of others. Haiyao Jushi and Emperor Zun are very good friends. That's why he has this reason to help us... Then why is this Blood Lotus Female Butcher an elder in the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe they are also friends. Like guests or something like that?"</p>

    <p>"Since we are friends, then just help in the name of a friend. Wearing the skin of a beautiful earth cultivator, you can hide your identity as the Blood Lotus Female Butcher for a while. You are willing to hide in the Office of Strategic Deception and become a Elder, don't you think it's strange?" Master Ba said.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>"Master Ba is right." Immediately, many people began to nod.</p>

    <p>They thought about the behemoth hidden behind the Office of Strategic Deception. They all became a little panicked for a while: "So if that's the case... wouldn't there be many eternal beings hidden behind the Office of Strategic Deception. Even the Office of Strategic Deception Lord Diulei, the leader of the Deception Sect, and the elders of the core group may be the ones!"</p>

    <p>"So. This is also what Senior Haiyao Jushi is most worried about."</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Ba Ye's expression was particularly solemn. His tone was low. Everyone could feel a secret tension as he spoke: "Although Senior Haiyao Jushi's action failed this time, we at least tested the Office of The foundation of Strategic Deception. Avoid direct losses from head-on confrontation."</p>

    <p>"The opponent may have at least ten Eternals in their hands. Can we really resist?"</p>

    <p>"Heh. Are you looking down on Emperor Zun?"</p>

    <p>Ba Ye laughed: "Emperor never said that. His only friend is Senior Haiyao Jushi... and I have already received the news. In the future, Emperor will continue to send more than 20 Eternals to support him openly and secretly." I'll wait."</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, Emperor Zun thought that the Office of Strategic Deception must be crushed first, and its economic network must be destroyed first. Therefore, the senior Eternal One sent to us by Akari is also a master in this field..."</p>

    <p>"What kind of senior is he?"</p>

    <p>"This senior's eternal nickname is: Stone Pointer. As the name suggests, he has a way to turn wasteland into spiritual stones. This is much faster than inputting spiritual power into a spiritual stone making machine."</p>

    <p>Mr. Ba said: "With the great help of this senior stone master, we can cash out the spiritual stones created by selling the stone master. We will be able to continuously expand the capital without any losses. Finally, we will have a monopoly." The entire earth's spiritual stones. Depressing the value of immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"So that's it. Are you going to short-sell the Office of Strategic Deception?" A six-star tengu said in surprise: "But after all, there are eternal beings in the Office of Strategic Deception. If they send the eternal beings to input spiritual power, use the spiritual stone making machine to create the spiritual stone... be a hedge against us?"</p>

    <p>"It's impossible to hedge." Master Ba shook his head: "The steps for making spiritual stones on Earth are complicated. After inputting the spiritual power, it needs to be repeatedly purified to form the spiritual stone. Although the spiritual power in the Eternal One's body is like the sea, they are, after all, He is a person from the ages. The energy in his body consists of more than just spiritual power..."</p>

    <p>"Such a complex energy composition. It is impossible to analyze it with the spiritual stone manufacturing equipment on the earth. Unless there is a person who can continuously produce pure spiritual power. And he can continue to output it regardless of the cost."</p>

    <p>Ba Ye smiled and said: "Such a person, as everyone here should know very well, does not exist at all. Using the spirit stone making machine to continuously produce spirit stones, and continuing to input spiritual power without rest will waste your lifespan."</p>

    <p>"Even if it is a ready-made spirit stone manufacturing factory, it must follow a reasonable rotation mechanism."</p>

    <p>"There's no way anyone would be stupid enough to squeeze themselves dry in a place like this."</p>

    <p>"What Master Ba said makes sense. Squeeze yourself dry. This is not good for your kidneys."</p>

    <p>In the field, all the tengu burst into laughter. The originally tense atmosphere gradually began to relax.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, everyone. Emperor Zun and I promised that the senior Eternal One who is coming to our aid this time will definitely bring down the Office of Strategic Deception. In addition to the Stone Pointer just introduced to Akari, there are also senior Eternal Ones. Quite a few. Let me introduce them to you later."</p>

    <p>"As for the secret senior Eternal One..."</p>

    <p>"Where are these seniors?"</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, they are already lurking among cultivators on Earth. And like the Blood Lotus female butcher disguised as the Wang Piaoliang, they have an excellent identity as a cover-up."</p>

    <p>"They may be the male celebrities you are pursuing, the female idols, the delivery boy, the brand sneaker manufacturer who never apologizes. Or the author who never updates and should be cut into pieces..."</p>
