  <h1>Chapter 1192 "Wang Ling" laughed?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group has always been equipped with an excellent missile launch force. Since elixirs are refined, raw materials are needed. The unwritten rule in the elixir industry is that buying is worse than planting. And large enterprises have professional spiritual plants. Cultivation base. In this way, the cost of raw materials can be reduced to a minimum.</p>

    <p>As for the meaning of the existence of the missile group, it exists to meet the growth needs of spiritual plants. Some spiritual plants like rainfall, some spiritual plants like sunshine, and some spiritual plants like heavy fog and even make a living by sucking 25 ... So under this premise, the missile team of the Huaguo Shuilian Group came in handy.</p>

    <p>The cloud-clearing bomb is just one type of "climate bomb" in the missile team. As the name suggests, its main function is to cause the clouds to disperse and the sun to shine on the earth in rainy or foggy weather.</p>

    <p>In addition, there are also "Blue Sea Tide Bombs" that can summon rainy days. "Mirror Flower Water Moon Bombs" for foggy days. "Wangwang Ice Crushing Bombs" for hail weather. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>"After all, it's the Huaguo Shuilian Group. It's really rich and powerful."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao couldn't help but marvel in the background. Although it was not the first time they saw Sun Rong's "fancy show off wealth" operation, they still felt very surprised... Such a climate Bullet. The cost of making one is not low.</p>

    <p>But now, Number 60 High School's camp really needs a little sunshine. Because the air is too humid, the Talisman team has complained that the temporarily produced talisman paper is too humid. This will reduce the success rate of drawing Talisman. At the same time, Will affect the effect of Talisman when triggered.</p>

    <p>And because of the humidity, everyone's body has always been in a "wet" state. If the sun shines down, it can just solve the urgent problem caused by the "moistness."</p>

    <p>This bullet was launched at the right time!</p>

    <p>It can meet the needs of sunlight for 2 hours. That is, the effectiveness will fade away at almost 11 o'clock.</p>

    <p>The day and night temperatures at Fire Peak are very high. Sun Rong chose to launch at this time. Not only can it help everyone get rid of moisture on their bodies, but it can also avoid direct sunlight at noon when the temperature is the hottest.</p>

    <p>Of course... everyone knows very well. Sun Rong's purpose in doing all this is for everyone's common group favorite classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling is making simple preparations for a trip to the sun to find out. Wang Zhen is trying his best to delay time. And he must resolve this battle as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>However, it is said that it will be "resolved as soon as possible." But how long it will take. Wang Ling In fact, this time there is no real certainty.</p>

    <p>Judging from all the information known so far, this is already the most troublesome person among all the opponents Wang Ling has fought against.</p>

    <p>The information they received was limited. Even the origin of the man behind the scenes was not clear. This was a situation that had never happened before.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling's various predictions and divination spells have no effect on this mysterious man behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>This feeling of looking up into the black void is the first time Wang Ling has experienced it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when the origin of the other party is unclear, Wang Ling feels it is prudent to make more preparations.</p>

    <p>There are various magic weapons in his king's treasure house. In the past, Wang Ling has never used them in battles. Because no matter how "strong" the person is, they cannot withstand the power of his slap. But this time. Wang Ling feels that the time to activate the treasure house is completely mature.</p>

    <p>As an excuse to go to the toilet. Wang Ling had a bag accident with his clone "Crispy Noodles Dao Lord." This is the real clone that Wang Ling left in the War Ignorance Bureau before. It has its own intelligence. Lord Diulei called "Crispy Noodles Dao Lord" Wang Ling a trump card.</p>

    <p>This understanding is actually correct.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling wants to leave temporarily. He has thought about it for the best to keep Crispy Noodles Dao Lord here. Ordinary clones will disintegrate directly if they are damaged. But the real clone will not.</p>

    <p>And Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is strong enough. If any emergency occurs, he can protect the safety of everyone here.</p>

    <p>Standing face to face with Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. Wang Ling felt like he was looking in the mirror. Especially when Crispy Noodles put on the same school uniform as himself. There was almost no difference.</p>

    <p>"Leave it to you." Wang Ling gently patted Crispy Noodles on the shoulder. Then the next moment, his figure disappeared directly on the spot...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This kind of transfer seems to be seamless. It will not leave any flaws. However, it turns out that Wang Ling still underestimates some people's understanding of themselves...</p>

    <p>As the true avatar of Wang Ling, Crispy Noodles has been patiently learning all kinds of knowledge about business management in the war. Because he is the avatar of Wang Ling, his identity will not be revealed easily. Always. Wearing a special mask to hide his face, he looks exactly like Wang Ling. They can almost be described as brothers. If they weren't too obedient, sometimes even Lord Diulei would admit his mistake.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Wang Ling left his real avatar in the war. The main purpose was to help Lord Diulei to add some personnel and reliable combat power. For a newly established sect, it always needs a few people who can shake up the main scene. Expert's.</p>

    <p>Crispy noodles are very obedient.</p>

    <p>He is a clone without superfluous emotions.</p>

    <p>And in accordance with the instructions of Wang Ling. He obeyed all tasks assigned to him by Diulei.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning of the sect's security work, to the current corporate management, employee training, etc. Nowadays, crispy noodles have become an indispensable HR for new members of the Bureau of War and Ignorance when they join the sect.</p>

    <p>Like this field mission, it was the first time for Crispy Noodles to participate in it.</p>

    <p>The exchange was completed. Crispy Noodles entered his memory according to Wang Ling. Based on the previous behavior pattern of Wang Ling, he began to return to the camp step by step.</p>

    <p>He walked out of the makeshift toilet and saw that the Huaguo Shuilian Group's "cloud-clearing bomb" had been successfully launched in the distance.</p>

    <p>The missile soared up from the ground, breaking through layers of clouds and fog. Finally, the clouds and fog in the Jiulong Mountain area were dispersed, allowing the sun to shine down.</p>

    <p>The warm beam of light hit Crispy Noodles' face. For some reason, Crispy Noodles felt happy. The corners of his mouth couldn't help but start to rise.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling you..." Sun Rong happened to see this scene from a distance. This was also the first time she saw Wang Ling's unexpected expression besides facial paralysis: "You... Were you laughing just now? Classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that Wang Ling would be so happy after seeing the sun. She would even smile happily.</p>

    <p>This is something Sun Rong has never discovered before.</p>

    <p>You must write it down in a small notebook! --Classmate Wang Ling. I like the sunshine!</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong finally figured it out. Why Wang Ling sat in the second to last row by the window! Isn't this just to be closer to the sun?</p>
