  <h1>Chapter 1911 The eternal king. Unparalleled splendor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Who is it...</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling took off his outer robe and rolled up his sleeves, Peng Xiren seemed to see the back of a god emitting brilliant light.</p>

    <p>He couldn't see through who the person in this body was. But he could intuitively feel the shining powerful soul. It was the key to maintaining this body's invincibility.</p>

    <p>Facing the outer gods, the sanctified physical body is obviously not enough anymore.</p>

    <p>As the Great Emperor, Emperor Dongda's body must be tempered by the Suzaku fire every day. Before he became the emperor, he had already reached the state of physical sanctification.</p>

    <p>After that, he exercised day after day and continuously improved the strength of his physical body. Such a body is indeed much stronger than those of the eternal cultivators of the royal family.</p>

    <p>However, after the battle with the Outer God, Wang Ling could still clearly feel that the strength of this body was not enough. In the process of the beating just now, because of the huge force impacting the Outer God, and at the same time due to the reaction relationship. The shock caused Emperor Dongda's body to feel a faint ache.</p>

    <p>But it was only Emperor Dongda that felt the pain, because he was the owner of this body. Although Wang Ling controlled this body, he was also a little irritated by Emperor Dongda's wails.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he took off this robe and planned to apply secret techniques on this body to make the physical body stronger than before.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Emperor Dongda's upper body was emitting golden light. Runes appeared on his body.</p>

    <p>This is not a magic talisman. It is not an eternal mysterious text. It is not the text of any tribe in the universe. However, it exudes a powerful divinity that seems to come from the origin of the universe.</p>

    <p>"Immortal King's Seal!" Wang Ying was secretly surprised. His heart was horrified.</p>

    <p>Even he didn't expect that Wang Ling would resort to such means at a critical moment.</p>

    <p>This is a secret method that combines the natal dharma with the designated soul and body. It is completely controlled by the will of Wang Ling. Once the fusion is achieved, a shining golden divine imprint will appear on the body!</p>

    <p>As the shadow of Wang Ling, Wang Ying knows the origin of this technique... If the person he faces is not a strong enemy, Wang Ling will never use such a move at this time.</p>

    <p>The natal dharma sign. Wang Ling was only shown once a long time ago. And at that time, it was not to the point of directly combining the natal dharma sign to fight. It was still mostly intimidation and shock.</p>

    <p>This time. When Wang Ying saw the "immortal king's seal" densely covered on Dongda's body, Wang Ying knew clearly... Wang Ling Seriously.</p>

    <p>The warm-up he said earlier was not just a simple talk.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Under the blessing of the Immortal King's Seal, Emperor Dongda's fair and delicate body received even more powerful blessings. His body seemed to have become the center of the universe.</p>

    <p>Everyone vaguely saw the body surrounding Emperor Dongda. The sun, moon and stars were hovering nearby. Under the blessing of the Immortal King's Seal, his physical body evolved directly in one fell swoop and became the Immortal King's Body!</p>

    <p>The prototype of the universe was born directly in the physical body. It was terrifying.</p>

    <p>Phew!</p>

    <p>The next moment, Emperor Dongda set off. His speed was extremely fast. His boundless magic power allowed him to approach Sayani Gusi without any hindrance.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Stomping down, the earth collapsed. It was as if there were endless stars from the universe hitting the earth's surface. The land under his feet was shaken into flames. It was like a volcano erupting. The endless collision of divine fire turned into huge mushroom clouds boiling here.</p>

    <p>Sayani Guth was burned to the point of roaring in pain. Its tentacles were burned into scorched earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's foot stepped directly on the belly of the Dark Mother Goddess. Its body was instantly ignited. It spread along the trajectory of the tentacles to the entire lower body.</p>

    <p>At that moment, they can see Sayani Gusi vomiting out a lot of mucus, using the mucus to fill up the divine fire on its body. Although it seemed to have been beaten unilaterally, it did not give up its resistance.</p>

    <p>The powerful self-healing power caused its burned tentacles to grow back. At the same time, Wang Ling also noticed that Sayani Gusi sprayed out many jet-black meat balls.</p>

    <p>This is a creature bred from it. The first wave of spit contained more than a hundred meatballs. It was as huge as a mountain. It split immediately after landing on the ground for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>It was an ancient creature bred from its mother's body. A terrifying giant beast called the Black Goat. Each of them was astonishingly terrifying in size only when they were young. Their fighting power was astonishing. It seemed as if they could crush everything with their own iron hooves.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in Wang Ling's view, this kind of reproductive ability is indeed amazing.</p>

    <p>Even when she was completely beaten by him, she was able to give birth to so many monsters.</p>

    <p>This is the terrifying thing about this dark mother goddess.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling is not here, he is afraid that this wave of impact alone, even if the emperor appears, may not be able to stop such an invasion.</p>

    <p>These black goats are amazing when they are young. As long as there are ten black goats, destroying a Penglai star is not a problem at all.</p>

    <p>And now, there are hundreds of them gestating here.</p>

    <p>The Dark Mother Goddess's powerful reproductive ability allows her to continuously create legions of black goats. At the same time, these black goats bred also have amazing reproductive capabilities.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that Sayani Gusi made a mistake after all, because the person it was facing at this moment was not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling moved very quickly. He grabbed a black goat directly from the air. He bumped it unceremoniously towards Sayani Gusi. The sheep was as big as a mountain. Wang Ling was controlled by the gravity of the universe. It was completely effortless.</p>

    <p>He just stood there and slowly raised his hands. In just a moment, the aura of dominating the world flourished.</p>

    <p>Everyone here is stunned. No one has seen Wang Ling continuously casting powerful spells. In the past, this problem could only be solved with a few slaps at most.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the young man stood in the field with the body of Emperor Dongda. His every move exuded the majesty of an unparalleled immortal king.</p>

    <p>Time and space here seem to have been cut off. Countless black goats were lifted directly by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just in their bodies, golden light seeped out. Then it slowly began to surge along their bodies. It penetrated from every pore of their bodies, cracking...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next second. The moment Wang Ling closed his palms, his body exploded instantly!</p>

    <p>"It's too strong... Is this still a human being?" After his body was marked with the Immortal King's Seal, Emperor Dongda no longer felt physical pain. Not only did he stop screaming, but he also maintained a quiet and gasping tone throughout the process.</p>

    <p>The power of this senior king was beyond his expectation. Those were hundreds of black goats! The legions of Outer Gods bred from the body of the Dark Mother Goddess descended here in dense numbers and were bred. He thought they could destroy the Penglai Star. The whole thing was trampled to pieces.</p>

    <p>As a result, they didn't jump around for long before they were all caught in the air. Under Wang Ling's remote blast, they turned into powder...</p>
