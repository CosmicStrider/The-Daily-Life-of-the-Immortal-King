  <h1>Chapter 1533 Peng Xiren's Question Mark</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Since I was separated from Peng Xiren last time, Wang Ling has thought about many scenarios of meeting him again.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that it would be delivered to my door proactively like this.</p>

    <p>The moment he pinched Peng Xiren's head, Wang Ling did not take action directly.</p>

    <p>Because the head in my hand now is not Peng Xiren's own.</p>

    <p>He is attached to the body of that girl Matsushita Singha. He is very cunning.</p>

    <p>Although Peng Xiren was shocked that Wang Ling noticed him, and the moment his body came out, he grabbed his head.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, he had already anticipated this bad situation.</p>

    <p>That's why he chose to possess the contestants.</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling is holding Matsushita Singha's head. She really doesn't dare to do anything.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling...You have the ability. Let's do it."</p>

    <p>The voice of Peng Xiren comes from Matsushita Singha's body.</p>

    <p>Both he and Wang Ling know very well what will happen once the head is crushed.</p>

    <p>The young man in front of him has extraordinary skills. It is not difficult to resurrect a person.</p>

    <p>Even if your head is crushed, maybe you just need to shake your fingers.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha's body and soul can be quickly reshaped.</p>

    <p>And such a method. In fact, Peng Xiren can also do it.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because he knew that Wang Ling had such power that Peng Xiren laid such a trap in a targeted manner.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling has the power to resurrect Matsushita Singha, will the resurrected Matsushita Singha still be the same Matsushita Singha?</p>

    <p>This point should draw a question mark.</p>

    <p>"This girl's soul is my hostage." Peng Xiren smiled.</p>

    <p>He expected that Wang Ling would not dare to take action.</p>

    <p>Reversely designed Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the moment his head was pinched by Wang Ling's hand, Peng Xiren was surprised. But he never showed fear: "Wang Ling. You have completely lost. Don't you dare pinch. Blast this girl's head off? Her soul is imprisoned by me. The new soul after reshaping is not her original soul... Such a resurrection has no meaning."</p>

    <p>"..." Upon hearing this, Wang Ling was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren seems to have calculated everything thoroughly.</p>

    <p>However, he missed one point.</p>

    <p>That is in this universe. In fact, there are no hostages that Wang Ling cannot rescue.</p>

    <p>--Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment. Wang Ling opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>--King's Eyes opens the eyes!</p>

    <p>Meet Peng Xiren's eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced for ten thousand years.</p>

    <p>It feels like you are in the center of the universe for an instant.</p>

    <p>Endless stars are connected to each other. They spread to extremely long distances in an instant.</p>

    <p>It was like a radar ripple that could not be measured with concepts. Suddenly, Wang Ling captured the location of Matsushita Singha's soul.</p>

    <p>Now that I've found the location...</p>

    <p>Then as long as she is rescued, there is no need to worry about the replacement of this girl's soul after resurrection.</p>

    <p>On the other side. Matsushita Singha, who was imprisoned in a confined space by Peng Xiren, didn't know what was happening.</p>

    <p>She was clearly taking an adventure in a secret room. But suddenly the scene in front of her changed. She appeared in a multi-colored aurora world.</p>

    <p>What caught her eyes was a beautiful cherry blossom forest. There seemed to be a mysterious person playing the piano in the forest.</p>

    <p>The melodious sound of the piano echoes in the woods. It makes people yearn for it...</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, Matsushita Singha longed for countless times the scene of herself and her lover walking in the cherry blossom forest.</p>

    <p>She likes cherry blossoms.</p>

    <p>I think it would be very romantic to be buried here after death.</p>

    <p>This is the soul space customized by Peng Xiren for Matsushita Singha.</p>

    <p>Everything in the space is formed according to Matsushita Singha's needs.</p>

    <p>For a girl, this is a paradise-like existence.</p>

    <p>Being here. You can forget everything.</p>

    <p>Gradually, I forget what I am doing. Why I am here... In the end, I will even forget myself...</p>

    <p>Beautiful cherry blossom forest. The falling pink petals carry a faint fragrance. They fall on Matsushita Singha's shoulders and hair.</p>

    <p>Everywhere is so beautiful. Everywhere can be photographed directly as a wallpaper collection.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha feels so happy.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why she came here.</p>

    <p>But the idea has arisen in my heart that it would be better to stay here for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>This is another one of Peng Xiren's tricks.</p>

    <p>As long as the soul has the thought of abandoning the body.</p>

    <p>That is a completely independent individual. Even if Wang Ling had the ability to search, it would be difficult to find Matsushita Singha.</p>

    <p>However, what made Peng Xiren miscalculated was...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling after activating King's Eyes. The speed of searching for Matsushita Singha is really too fast...</p>

    <p>It was so fast that he couldn't describe it in words.</p>

    <p>Just when Matsushita Singha was about to lose herself completely.</p>

    <p>A gentle hand fell on Matsushita Singha's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Who is..."</p>

    <p>Standing in the cherry blossom forest, the girl whose eyes had gradually become distracted suddenly came back to her senses.</p>

    <p>She looked at the fair-skinned boy who suddenly appeared behind her.</p>

    <p>The whole person was deeply attracted by the young man's face. Then he started to blush: "Houlang Sang...how could you..."</p>

    <p>It must be a dream!</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha blushed.</p>

    <p>She almost instantly remembered who she was and what she was doing just now.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Previously, she clearly broke through in the secret room.</p>

    <p>Why did you suddenly break into this beautiful cherry blossom forest?</p>

    <p>And... And I also saw Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>At this time, Houlang Sang's hand touched her shoulder. The temperature of the fingertips made Matsushita Singha think about it.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's not that I had to get it on purpose.</p>

    <p>His touch was just to speed up Matsushita Singha's recovery of his memories in the earthly world.</p>

    <p>That is what is called. All the stuff from the earthly world.</p>

    <p>As for the cherry blossom forest here, everything is an illusion. Everything is fake!</p>

    <p>These are the things of the underworld.</p>

    <p>Even the sound of the piano heard in the cherry blossom forest is also Yin music!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling appeared in time.</p>

    <p>All of Matsushita Singha's thoughts were brought back at once.</p>

    <p>But it looks like...</p>

    <p>This girl seems to have some misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want to wait until Matsushita Singha returned to her body. Because of this "dream", she started to think about some messy things.</p>

    <p>Then he reached out and tapped Matsushita Singha's forehead gently.</p>

    <p>Tampered with her memory.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The location of Matsushita Singha was successfully found through King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling after the swift girl's soul was rescued, she also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren in front of him not only did not show a trace of fear, but laughed arrogantly: "Wang Ling! You were fooled again! Do you think that rescuing Matsushita Singha is the end? Just now you used your pupil power to search the entire The universe. It must have consumed a lot of spiritual power..."</p>

    <p>In Peng Xiren's calculation. Because of the use of pupil power to search for Matsushita Singha throughout the universe, Wang Ling's aura will definitely become weaker than before.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, there was a harsh sound of steam, like boiling water.</p>

    <p>The boy in front of me began to emit billowing smoke...</p>

    <p>A large amount of incomplete seal Talisman's broken smoke evaporated from Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>And accompanied by the generation of these smoke.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can feel it. A series of one-time Talisman failures.</p>

    <p>"Did you try too hard just now..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>But since these disposable Talisman are consumed.</p>

    <p>Then it means.</p>

    <p>His aura is a billion points stronger than before...</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren finally started sweating on his forehead. His head was full of question marks.</p>
