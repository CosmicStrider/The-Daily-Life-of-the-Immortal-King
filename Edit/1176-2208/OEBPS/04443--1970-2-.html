  <h1>Chapter 1970 Divine soldiers descend from heaven</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are a total of 1,000 modified dwarf figurines. Because the design of the drawing itself is relatively short and concise, it does not take too long to complete a whole one.</p>

    <p>As long as you use the operating table here, you can completely realize automatic fabrication of a thousand dwarf figurines. And they can be put into use immediately after they are made. The entire automation time is estimated to take about an hour.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Zhang Linyan both found that Li Changzhe was really not bad at all when it came to the ability to complete life. In particular, they discovered that among the thousand dwarf figurines, about 100 of them were quite special.</p>

    <p>They don't have normal facial features. They actually have three ears and six eyes on their heads...</p>

    <p>"What is this..." Zhang Linyan was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Nezha." Li Changzhe said proudly.</p>

    <p>"Nezha doesn't look like this! He has three heads and six arms! That's not the case! You are an alien! An alien!" Zhang Linyan really couldn't hold back her desire to complain. It stands to reason that being calm and collected should be a compulsory lesson for an archer. But she doesn't know why she feels that Li Changzhe's operation is too outrageous.</p>

    <p>"These 100 are specially designed scouts. The two armies are facing each other. What can we do without reconnaissance?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe frowned and said: "But I changed it this way. The overall strength of this dwarf figurine seems to be not as good as that of a normal humanoid. It is only from the middle to the late Foundation Building period. That is, it is the level of a high school student in an ordinary cultivation high school..."</p>

    <p>He kept thinking about it. When he said this, he glanced at Wang Ling again: "Sorry Wang Ling. I'm not talking about you. Although Number 60 High School is quite ordinary, you are an elite. Well! And he's the mascot of the elite!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"That's not the point, hey!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan pushed Li Changzhe and pulled his ears.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this scene and fell into deep thought. But what he was thinking deeply about was not these "monsters" created by Li Changzhe. Instead, he felt that the scene in front of him was very similar to those who seemed to have a crush on each other during class. The appearance of boys and girls.</p>

    <p>He is laughing. She is making trouble...</p>

    <p>Just at a quick glance, Wang Ling suddenly discovered that Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe are quite compatible. And the key is that their personalities complement each other.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't stop him. He just folded his arms and watched quietly. He didn't expect that a common scene in the classroom would now happen in this underground palace.</p>

    <p>Perhaps they noticed the scorching gazes of Wang Ling and the miners. Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe were quite embarrassed. They blushed and turned their gazes to their respective operating stations in an attempt to distract everyone.</p>

    <p>"Strange. Is there no alarm in this underground palace?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Senior Brother Haorenfeng, who had been silent all this time, as if he had been forgotten by the author, and whose name had not even appeared, raised a question.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that they have modified the models of the remaining human figurines in the underground palace on such a large scale and invaded such a deep place. The Wuxiang Peak side should have noticed it a long time ago.</p>

    <p>But now there is no response from the Phaseless Peak. This is obviously extremely abnormal.</p>

    <p>Alarm devices and monitoring devices. Of course there are also underground palaces.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw it the moment he entered the underground palace.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to use illusions to interfere secretly. But he found that Wang Ming took action first. He directly turned off the alarm device. Then he freeze the scene in the underground palace, keeping it as no one is invading. At the same time, he kept the time display on the upper right side normal.</p>

    <p>In this way, it was a seamless invasion. It was as if the Jingwei Thieves staged a grand assembly here.</p>

    <p>But the fact is that Wuxiang Peak has no time to take into account the situation in the underground palace. In order to block the coalition forces of Twenty Peaks, after the four hundred completed human figurines went into battle, the leader of Wuxiang Peak was naturally planning a defensive layout. matters.</p>

    <p>The remaining one hundred human figurines in the underground palace were all unfinished products with missing arms and legs. They had no time to pay attention to them.</p>

    <p>The key point now is to postpone it until the day of the sect competition. The plan of the Twenty Peaks to join forces against the Phaseless Peak must not be allowed to succeed.</p>

    <p>At this time, the peak leader of Wuxiang Peak held a tablet and began to deploy the four hundred warrior figurines that had entered the battle in Wuxiang Peak and surrounding high-terrain areas.</p>

    <p>There was no need for modern weapons at all. He entered the magic formula of "Finger Spear Technique·Earth" into the four hundred fighting figurines.</p>

    <p>This is a spell that can use local materials to turn soil into bullets. Then use the knuckles of your fingers as triggers to shoot the soil bullets at high speed.</p>

    <p>The further the distance, the higher the damage. With their distance, as long as the vital points of those students can be concentrated, most of them will be eliminated before the sect competition.</p>

    <p>At this time, four hundred late-stage Golden Core human figurines had already surrounded the highlands around Phaseless Peak. They all had exactly the same faces. It was as if someone had used a clone technique.</p>

    <p>There is no shortage of earth elements in the mountains. They can use the "Finger Spear Art·Earth" spell to perfectly utilize the terrain to carry out highland sniper attacks on all invading coalition forces.</p>

    <p>The current situation of Wuxiang Peak is no longer a situation of being beaten unilaterally. This is a serious positional battle. Wuxiang Peak uses human figurines to hold on to the high ground.</p>

    <p>Even if those disciples are cowering on the top of the mountain and don't come out, there won't be any problem.</p>

    <p>Such fortifications can be described as indestructible.</p>

    <p>In front of the main position of Twenty Peaks. This wave of operations by Wuxiang Peak undoubtedly brought huge pressure to everyone.</p>

    <p>Although the current Wuxiang Peak appears to be calm on the surface, everyone does not know why there is always an illusion that the top of the mountain seems to be obscured by an endless dark storm.</p>

    <p>As long as you get a little closer to the center of the storm, you will have to pay the price of being shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>He is just a cultivator at the peak of the late Golden Core. Maybe there is not much pressure. As cultivators selected from high school students from various countries, many people have already entered the Golden Core in high school.</p>

    <p>Some people are even on the same level as their own class teacher. Usually the class teacher uses coercion to intimidate them, but they are all unconcerned.</p>

    <p>But now the situation is completely different. The peak of the four hundred Golden Cores in the later period is at the highest point. The superimposition of the momentum can be described as terrifying.</p>

    <p>"What should we do?" someone asked. He started to panic inexplicably.</p>

    <p>In front of the coach's camp. Sun Rong is sitting upright. His slender jade-white fingers are intertwined, as if he is waiting for something.</p>

    <p>She didn't reply.</p>

    <p>Just a few minutes later, a slight shaking sound suddenly came from behind the Twenty Peaks Alliance camp. The extremely small dwarf human figurines sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. They kept popping up from the ground...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong will know immediately.</p>

    <p>This is the support arranged by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now, it's time to level the Phaseless Peak!</p>
