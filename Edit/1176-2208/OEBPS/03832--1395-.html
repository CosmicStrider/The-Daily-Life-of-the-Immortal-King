  <h1>Chapter 1395 The wheel of the car hit my face</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A strong feeling of discomfort spread to the hearts of Lao Hui and the younger brothers behind him. Their faces quickly turned pale, and then they began to have difficulty breathing.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui didn't know what happened, let alone why the back of a boy in the Foundation Building period looked so scary!</p>

    <p>In the eyes of Lao Hui and others, Wang Ling is now a wild beast with teeth and claws!</p>

    <p>Is this the legendary back-shadow killing...</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The dozen or so invisible units behind Wang Ling, led by Lao Hui, all fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui lay on the ground and struggled for a while. Then he completely lost consciousness and fell into a temporary state of shock.</p>

    <p>A battle has already been declared over before it even begins.</p>

    <p>The gas emitted by the Water of Fear is colorless and odorless. It is not easy for people to detect.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, even Lao Hui himself would not have thought of it.</p>

    <p>In addition to having a "terrifying back", the player in front of him is also a walking air purifier.</p>

    <p>The gas emitted by this "Water of Fear" has not been completely diffused through the air. It has been inhaled into Wang Ling's body. Then it was all purified.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's human body purification ability is unimaginable.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, with the power of this water of fear, I don't know how many people would faint within a radius of 500 meters...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Fang Xing followed Sun Rong. They were sure that Sun Rong had noticed the invisible unit ahead.</p>

    <p>"Dual-core Aohai. It's really amazing...I feel like I may not be her opponent now." Wang Zhen swallowed.</p>

    <p>He had already felt the terror of Aohai's sword energy from several places apart.</p>

    <p>This is just the normal flow of sword energy. It is like a bottle of perfume that has been left standing. It is emitting fragrance to the surroundings. Sun Rong did not let Aohai's sword energy be released at all. The breath was already very terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Is this the strongest Foundation Building? It is indeed very strong."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing touched his chin and said meaningfully: "Let's withdraw."</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong's combat power has become stronger. They continue to follow. I'm afraid they will be exposed.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you going to observe Student Sun's reaction?" Wang Zhen said via voice message.</p>

    <p>"That's enough. It seems like she really cares. Otherwise, she wouldn't be following Chen Chao right after school." Fang Xing said.</p>

    <p>They chose to follow Sun Rong before. On the one hand, they wanted to see Sun Rong's reaction. On the other hand, they also noticed a group of people wearing invisibility charms and acting suspiciously.</p>

    <p>As a core member of the Office of Strategic Deception, Sun Rong's existence is like a younger sister to Wang Zhen and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>They were worried that something might happen, so they kept following Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But now, after truly feeling the terrifying sword energy emanating from Aohai, Fang Xing felt that this was no longer necessary.</p>

    <p>To use a classic movie line. Now Sun Rong can put his hands on his hips and shout: "I want to fight ten!"</p>

    <p>But it depends on the actual situation.</p>

    <p>With such combat power, it would be useless even if there are hundreds of millions of Golden Cores...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Wang Zhen and Fang Xing had just walked a few steps along another road.</p>

    <p>There was movement in the dark alley.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stepped into the dark alley. The powerful sword energy was released.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A huge pressure fell from the air. The members of the loyalty team were instantly shaken out of their wits. One by one, they foamed at the mouth and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong? Why are you here..." Chen Chao was shocked. He had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>I only heard a sound of falling to the ground behind me.</p>

    <p>When he turned around, he saw Sun Rong standing behind him.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao. Sorry..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had no idea what happened to White Hair. He was knocked unconscious by Sun Rong's quick blow with the knife.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong retained his strength. The palm of his hand was covered with a hint of Aohai's sword energy. It was enough to stun Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>The girl's actions were clean and neat. She struck decisively without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, all those people with the invisibility charms were knocked down by Sun Rong's sword energy.</p>

    <p>She recycled all the love letters. Then she helped Chen Chao, who had fainted, to the side. Then she started calling Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche received the message from Sun Rong. He thought his plan was successful. He was overjoyed: "What's wrong, Miss? Are you in trouble?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! It's very troublesome!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a moment and nodded: "Mainly, there are a lot of people who fainted..."</p>

    <p>"What?" Jiang Xiaoche was stunned.</p>

    <p>"There is a group of Golden Core gangsters who followed my classmates all the way. I don't know what happened. They all seemed to have fainted. Before they wake up. Brother Xiaoche, please come over and deal with it quickly! The other thing is... my one My classmate's name is Chen Chao. He also fainted. Remember to send him home!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Hang up the phone. Jiang Xiaoche has many questions in his mind.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So on the first day that Number 60 High School resumed school, Number 60 High School was in the news...</p>

    <p>It's not because of the renovation of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The content of the news report was mainly related to a car accident that occurred in front of 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling While watching the news, I felt that the female anchor was suppressing her laughter while reporting this incident.</p>

    <p>Female anchor: "An accident occurred in front of 60 High School in Peiyuan District, Songhai City. Fourteen men with invisibility charms and special film and television props were lying neatly on the road in front of 60 High School. So much so that parents driving to pick up their children could not avoid running over them. Please read the detailed interview news below..."</p>

    <p>On TV, a female reporter handed the microphone to Lao Hui: "Who are you? Why do you appear at the school gate with an invisibility charm?"</p>

    <p>"I...we are members of the crew. On the way home from filming, I forgot to open it. Then I was so tired that I fainted and fell to the ground..." Lao Hui explained in a hurry.</p>

    <p>His face and body were all covered with wheel marks.</p>

    <p>No fewer than a dozen cars ran over him.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the foundation of realm, I'm afraid it would have become meat paste...</p>

    <p>As for the Golden Core cultivators behind them, they were not so lucky.</p>

    <p>They were also like Lao Hui. They were forced to suffer the experience of being repeatedly run over by cars.</p>

    <p>But they were not as unscathed as Lao Hui. Except for wheel marks on their bodies, most of them had broken bones.</p>

    <p>After being a good man, he joined the Loyalty Group for many years. Although Lao Hui also had the experience of laughing and joking with the group members from time to time.</p>

    <p>It's just that he didn't expect that one day a car would actually run over his face!</p>

    <p>--This is. Really, the wheel of the car is crushing your face!</p>

    <p>What a bad luck!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the top office of Huaguo Shuilian Group, Sun Yiyuan received a report from Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Rongrong was attacked by a group of people wearing invisibility charms on the way home from school. Then these people fainted for no apparent reason?" Sun Yiyuan put down the newspaper with a serious look on his face.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Jiang Xiaoche nodded: "Although the lady was safe, during the whole process, the classmate Wang Ling was just watching from behind! He did nothing! It's really too much!"</p>

    <p>"Xiaoche. I'm not talking about you. Your hostility towards your classmate Wang seems a bit obvious."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun rolled his eyes and said, "You said these people are wearing invisibility charms. He is in the Foundation Building stage. How could he know that someone is planning to attack Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The logic is clear and well-organized. Jiang Xiaoche instantly felt that he could not refute it.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun even smiled after he finished speaking: "They say that student Wang is a mascot, and it's true. You see, Rongrong was originally going to be in danger. In the end, this Wang Ling just happened to be behind her, isn't that indirectly helping Rongrong to turn danger into safety? I didn't think that Mr. Wang would be a good wife."</p>

    <p>"???" Jiang Xiaoche was shocked.</p>

    <p>God is so prosperous with his wife...</p>

    <p>However, he was still unconvinced: "But I heard that he received a lot of love letters today..."</p>

    <p>"How many envelopes?"</p>

    <p>"More than a hundred letters."</p>

    <p>"You have the same demeanor as I did back then. I received thousands of letters back then, but you didn't make such a fuss."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Collecting more shows that you are attractive. It indirectly proves that Rongrong has a good vision."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the bedroom. Sun Rong dumped all the love letters on his bed.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er looked shocked: "There are so many love letters! Can you read them, Rongrong? You have the task of recovering the Rubik's Cube tonight..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sat upright on the bed with his arms folded. He took a deep breath and said decisively: "Check! Er Ha will be here in half an hour. You can watch as much as you can."</p>
