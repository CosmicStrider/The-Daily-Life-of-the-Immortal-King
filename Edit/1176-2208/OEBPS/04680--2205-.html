  <h1>Chapter 2205 Tacit understanding and fate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It takes a genius to remember the address of this website in one second: [New] https://Fastest updates! No ads!</p>

    <p>The octopus man was captured. This was beyond Zhi Jiunian's expectation. After learning the information from Lu Xiao, he immediately frowned. A low pressure immediately formed around him. Even though he couldn't see any eyes. Lu Xiao Xiao Du could feel Zhi Jiunian's anger from under the blindfold.</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian frowned and blamed: "It's such an important thing. Why don't you just interrupt the live broadcast to tell me?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... I'm sorry..." Lu Xiao was a little scared instinctively. He couldn't help but take a step back.</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian's realm was profound, far beyond the comparison of Lu Xiao and a Golden Core. Even without any spiritual pressure, just by turning his head and glancing in Lu Xiao's direction, Lu Xiao could already feel a great pressure. Cold sweat instantly ran down her back, soaking into her Han attire.</p>

    <p>"That's all."</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian took a deep breath. He calmed down his mind again and remained clear.</p>

    <p>His intuition told him that the capture of the octopus man was far from simple as it seemed. The whole thing looked like two high school students accidentally passed by the riverside. They saw suspicious aliens and reported them casually, triggering a cultivator inspection. Secretary's attention.</p>

    <p>But why would two high school students appear there at this time?</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian touched his chin. He felt that something was a little unusual: "Can you find out anything about these two high school students?"</p>

    <p>"I have already inquired about the boss..." Lu Xiao quickly replied: "They are students from Number 60 High School. It is said that the two of them are following a senior named Huang for outdoor training. However, the outdoor training happened after the report After the incident."</p>

    <p>"Senior named Huang? Is he a member of Huang Tingjian?" Remember the website address m.xbequge.com</p>

    <p>"No... it's just the same name. It is said that Senior Huang is extremely powerful. He defeated Huang Tingjian and obtained the scroll you gave him from Huang Tingjian."</p>

    <p>"It's interesting."</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian raised the corners of his lips and revealed a mysterious smile: "I can roughly guess the relationship between these two high school students and this senior Huang."</p>

    <p>"Eh?" Lu Xiao was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian did not continue what she said. Although Lu Xiao had been an assistant for a short time, she had already initially understood Zhi Jiunian's character.</p>

    <p>Her boss is an old riddler. Even if he knows something, he always tells half of the story. He will never tell himself the complete story.</p>

    <p>Lu Xiao knew that this might be because she had not yet fully gained the trust of Zhi Jiunian. But over time, she also developed a habit. That is, as long as the boss doesn't want to talk about it, she won't ask for it.</p>

    <p>After all, the more you know, the more dangerous you may be.</p>

    <p>"Wait for me here. I'm going to meet this guy for a while."</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian left these words to Lu Xiao. He stretched out his hand with clear finger bones from his sleeve robe. He pointed his white fingers into the void and rubbed it gently. The surrounding bamboo leaves floated from a distance and entangled themselves at his feet.</p>

    <p>I saw young Zhijiu standing on his tiptoes and taking advantage of the breeze to ride on the bamboo leaves and fly away.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Lao Huang is driving with Wang Ling, Sun Rong to the coordinates on the scroll. This is the specific location of the group of polyhedral aliens. As long as these aliens can be captured alive. Lao Huang Huang is now qualified to join the Universe Infinite Group.</p>

    <p>We drove the Spirit Bus all the way to the river. A dilapidated ferry caught the attention of Wang Ling. This was a ferry drifting on the river. However, no substantial salvage work was carried out. It was just moored.</p>

    <p>Moreover, an invisible defensive array has been set up outside the ferry. It is equivalent to an invisible island, floating on the river. Once a ship approaches, the ferry will move away on its own.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Someone must be driving the ferry. Wang Tong's ability to remove the false and preserve the true allows the invisible ferry to be clearly seen before Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>"There must be something wrong with this ferry."</p>

    <p>In the state where man and sword are united, Sun Rong can rely on the power of water droplets to sense the surroundings. He can feel the shape of the ferry on the river.</p>

    <p>Through the rearview mirror, Lao Huang saw the two of them working side by side in the back row. His eyes were almost directed towards the river from the same angle as if by divine help. Such a tacit understanding made Lao Huang suddenly feel that there was a kind of youthful romance in the air. The breath of...</p>

    <p>He didn't know if these two people did it on purpose, but if they didn't get along often, they wouldn't have such a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>And he seriously suspected that both of them were pretending to be pigs and eating tigers.</p>

    <p>Because from Huang's own perspective, there is... nothing at all on the river!</p>

    <p>So now Lao Huang has absolute reason to believe that he has definitely become the scapegoat in Huang Tingjian's abandoned factory just now...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he is the one who came for the internship!</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling and Sun Rong, Lao Huang's attitude from beginning to end was to be supportive and cooperative. There was no other reason. He just felt that these two people had a special sense of intimacy with him, especially them. A sufficient tacit understanding has been established in the game world. After returning to reality, this close feeling like family has not disappeared. This makes Lao Huang feel the preciousness of fate even more.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know why Wang Ling and Sun Rong were so young and so powerful.</p>

    <p>But what if you know?</p>

    <p>Lao Huang only thought it was very interesting to follow Wang Ling and Sun Rong to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>To be honest, for Lao Huang, it doesn't matter whether he can successfully join the Universe Infinite Group. He just wants to see what will happen next if he continues to follow two people who pretend to be pigs and eat tigers...</p>
