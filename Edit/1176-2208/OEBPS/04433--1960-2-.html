  <h1>Chapter 1960 Immortal King animation season 2 is scheduled to be released today</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As we all know, archery fighting is a training course included in the "Advanced Sword Mastery" that can only be mastered in the cultivation university stage. It is a required course for every professional archer. The top level is the tenth level.</p>

    <p>If you can practice to the tenth level, you can control multiple arrows to achieve turns in the arrow path.</p>

    <p>But it's obvious that Zhang Linyan's archery skills are more sophisticated. Before this, Qu Shuling had never seen that even split arrows could be integrated into the operation of "Arrow Fighting."</p>

    <p>This requires greater precision and control than the art of archery with multiple arrows...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling immediately frowned because Zhang Linyan was stronger than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the moment when the dense spell traps behind Wang Ling were exploded by the split-type archery arrows, even Zhang Linyan herself was startled.</p>

    <p>She was already ready for the second shot, because judging from the trajectory of the spiritual arrow she just launched, it didn't look like it would hit.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the spell traps behind Wang Ling were detonated in advance with one shot.</p>

    <p>This encouraged Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>Her luck today seems to be really good.</p>

    <p>The arrow shot out of desperation was so accurate by accident.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Brother Qu, are the miniature Talisman sticks on your nails still enough? They were all detonated at once. It's really tragic. I didn't expect you to use such a girly thing."</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't it be weird to put things on your nails? I thought only the concubines in the harem of the Qing Dynasty would do that."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe laughed. In such a situation, his chattering ability was activated. Along with a wave of invisible ridicule, Qu Shuling's whole expression changed drastically.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. This was done deliberately by Li Changzhe. Whether it was Zhang Linyan's arrow just now or Li Changzhe's vicious tongue now, it is essentially an act of rescue.</p>

    <p>After all, here, his level is at its lowest. This allows Qu Shuling to divert his energy away from himself as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt a faint feeling in his heart.</p>

    <p>He had only known Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan for a short time. Unexpectedly, these two people were quite reliable at critical moments.</p>

    <p>It has to be said that Li Changzhe's words were very effective. Qu Shuling originally wanted to deal with Wang Ling first. However, after Li Changzhe's words escaped, his whole aura changed.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the spiritual power in his hand exploded. The roaring spiritual energy actually caused the spiritual sword in his hand to split open on the spot.</p>

    <p>But this was originally an ordinary sect spirit sword issued by Wuxiang Peak. Qu Shuling never thought of seriously dealing with the three people in front of him at first.</p>

    <p>But now that he was so excited by Li Changzhe, it was obvious that he was really angry.</p>

    <p>With a wave of his arm, he summoned a jet-black spiritual sword. The luster of the night was like an abyss. It gave people an indescribable sense of danger.</p>

    <p>This is Qu Shuling's natal spiritual sword - Zhan Ye!</p>

    <p>In all of Qu Shuling's previous competitions, it was very rare for him to directly use Zhan Ye. It would only be summoned and used at critical moments.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe has conducted a detailed investigation on Qu Shuling before. In all official records recorded so far, the probability of Qu Shuling directly winning after using his spiritual sword to kill the night is... 100%!</p>

    <p>Yes. In the crucial competition, Dan Fan Qu Shuling sacrificed this weird jet black spiritual sword. He has never lost.</p>

    <p>He actually got really angry...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe secretly thought that something was wrong. He also taunted him out of desperation. He wanted to attract firepower. Unexpectedly, he used too much force and actually forced Qu Shuling to take out the Zhanye.</p>

    <p>He must know that in all previous competitions, Qu Shuling never lost when he played Zhan Ye. And he never really maximized Zhan Ye's power.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling walked slowly from the smoke in the distance carrying this mysterious jet-black spiritual sword. There was the rustle of crushed dead leaves under his feet. The restrained and faint murderous aura made people sweat.</p>

    <p>He looked like a sword demon shrouded in moonlight.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, without seeing Qu Shuling's figure clearly, the next moment he was close to his face. The moment his breath came closer, all the hairs on Li Changzhe's body stood up.</p>

    <p>What a speed this is. It's hard to overstate how frightening it is... After this person gets angry, does he actually act like this? Just like a ghost!</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling came with obvious murderous intent. Li Changzhe didn't know how powerful Zhan Ye's sword was, but he knew it in his heart. With Qu Shuling's ability, the sword must be deadly. It hits the vital point accurately.</p>

    <p>As long as it touches him, he may be eliminated.</p>

    <p>So the moment Qu Shuling's Zhan Ye approached, Li Changzhe turned into a ball of smoke to avoid the attack.</p>

    <p>This is "Gas Source." It is a stand-in type spell. It can temporarily vaporize one's body and turn it into a cloud of smoke. But the shortcomings are also obvious. If Qu Shuling counterattacks with sword energy, Li Changzhe will return to his original shape.</p>

    <p>However, this move is Li Changzhe's most proficient move. As one of the few life-saving spells in his hand, he has already practiced it to the top level of the tenth level.</p>

    <p>For any cultivator, the skill of keeping secrets is always a unique skill that needs to be practiced day and night. After all, only by surviving can there be any hope of cultivating.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, your murderous aura is too strong. Can't you calm down and say it properly?"</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Qu Shuling is really angry and murderous.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe had just finished speaking. His atomized body had not yet gathered into a body shape. Zhanye in Qu Shuling's hand actually separated. It transformed into several jet-black sword lights and stabbed towards him.</p>

    <p>This change of move caught Li Changzhe off guard. Seeing this in the distance, Zhang Linyan raised her bow again, trying to trace Zhan Ye's trajectory. However, Zhan Ye's speed was too fast. She could not complete the prediction at all.</p>

    <p>After looking in Qu Shuling's direction for a long time, she shot an arrow in a panic.</p>

    <p>Good opportunity...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling in the shade of the tree also seized the opportunity.</p>

    <p>Even though Zhang Linyan's arrow was in a hurry, as long as he was there, he could ensure a 100% hit.</p>

    <p>This time, Zhang Linyan did not use a split arrow. It was just an ordinary arrow.</p>

    <p>However, Qu Shuling was obviously on guard. When he saw Zhang Linyan shooting an arrow, he directly controlled Zhanye to pass a split sword light across it to achieve an air interception. He accurately targeted Zhang Linyan's ordinary arrow on the spot. Split in half.</p>

    <p>"A little trick..."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling hummed in his heart</p>

    <p>When he saw that Zhang Linyan's arrow had been knocked away by him, he stopped paying attention there.</p>

    <p>What he never expected was that the arrow, which had been accurately split into two halves, was still rushing forward according to its original flight path.</p>

    <p>Not only that. During the flight, the arrow that was split in half was actually coated with a light golden color...</p>

    <p>Strengthen?</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling's head was filled with questions.</p>
