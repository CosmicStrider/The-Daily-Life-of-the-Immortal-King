  <h1>Chapter 1609 Animalization Phenomenon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After returning home that night, Wang Ling compiled the data about today's experiment.</p>

    <p>The first is the issue about the black spiritual fluid. Wang Ling has not found any other abnormalities or sequelae for the time being.</p>

    <p>Rather, after putting on the school uniform jacket dripped with black spiritual liquid, he felt that the original Talisman seal on his body seemed to have reduced a lot of pressure.</p>

    <p>As for the "animal reagent" developed by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The rabbit ears are still growing on Wang Ling's head...</p>

    <p>He felt that this time was a bit too long. After returning home, he manually removed the reagent from his body.</p>

    <p>Animal reagents are inhaled reagents. That is to say, the reagent components in the body only need to be discharged.</p>

    <p>Normally Wang Ling would hold up his sword. And like the martial arts movie "Duan Yu" who drinks and drains the wine with his fingertips. And squeeze out the energy from his body.</p>

    <p>But because we were at home, Wang Ling was worried that the process of expelling the air might cause a big explosion...</p>

    <p>So he chose a very honest method.</p>

    <p>That is, drinking water and urinating, thereby expelling toxins through circulation in the body.</p>

    <p>The immortal king's kidney function is so powerful.</p>

    <p>No matter what kind of poison it is.</p>

    <p>There's nothing a quick pee can't fix.</p>

    <p>If not.</p>

    <p>Then pee again...</p>

    <p>During the entire process of going to the toilet, Wang Ling was thinking about the village chief of Shengshui Village...</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the development situation is over there.</p>

    <p>Maybe next time I go there.</p>

    <p>Will the whole village become an animal village?</p>

    <p>Because the temporary sealing effect of the black spiritual liquid dripping on the school uniform jacket is still continuing.</p>

    <p>That night, it was the first time Wang Ling had a good sleep in a while.</p>

    <p>He just wore his school uniform and jacket to sleep. There was no need to think about anything. There was no need to worry that his inadvertent snoring would explode through the earth.</p>

    <p>There is a very comfortable feeling.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling also knows deeply that this kind of comfort cannot last for too long.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming is currently unable to prove whether the black spiritual liquid extracted from the black stone will make Wang Ling resistant.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling now uses Talisman to seal it. It is because Wang Ling's resistance is getting bigger and bigger. As a result, Talisman's duration and effectiveness have been greatly shortened compared to before.</p>

    <p>Black stone and black spirit liquid are substances that have a new inhibitory effect on Wang Ling. Although Wang Ming needs to conduct several experiments, they must also ensure planned use.</p>

    <p>The purpose is to prevent Wang Ling from suddenly producing strange antibodies one day...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling is sleeping comfortably here, the situation here at Sun Rong is not very good.</p>

    <p>Mainly after touching Wang Ling's bunny ears. The irritation was too great... Until now, she can still feel the touch lingering on her hands. It was soft and warm.</p>

    <p>Tonight, she was reluctant to wash her hands.</p>

    <p>"You said...classmate Wang Ling knew clearly that the person in the cloak was me. But he didn't avoid me. He even put his head towards me. Is this a disguised indication that he likes me?"</p>

    <p>"..." Regarding this question, Sun Ying'er was silent for a while.</p>

    <p>She didn't dare to tell the fact that Wang Ling took the initiative to stick out her head and exchange for the packet of crispy noodles because her sister was too hungry.</p>

    <p>Of course, the main reason is also due to Wang Nuan's relationship.</p>

    <p>She was too afraid that Wang Nuan would turn off her permissions when he was angry...</p>

    <p>If this were a test, she would have to be bullied by that guy Wang Ying again.</p>

    <p>Although the "Planet thumping technique" has been used less often these days, her waist can't help but start to hurt when her sister thinks about it... This world is really unfriendly to delicate and beautiful girls!</p>

    <p>"Hey. Ying'er. Why don't you say anything... You are acting weird today..."</p>

    <p>"No...where can I find..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er didn't dare to reveal her true form. She was usually very carefree, but now she looked a little timid.</p>

    <p>In fact, I am afraid that when my real body is revealed, all my expressions will be written on my face.</p>

    <p>She has always been someone who can't hide her expressions.</p>

    <p>"Hey. When... can we hold hands all the time..." At night, Sun Rong lay on the pillow and thought deeply.</p>

    <p>She imagined that one day she could travel alone with Wang Ling without anyone else.</p>

    <p>Just Wang Ling and myself.</p>

    <p>The two people took a speeding vehicle. They enjoyed the beautiful scenery along the way. They held hands by the lake and felt the wind on the shore...</p>

    <p>Scenes like that seem to be found only in girls' comics. It makes Sun Rong's heart yearn for it.</p>

    <p>But the distance between reality and fantasy is very far.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knows clearly. As long as there is a peanut...</p>

    <p>She wouldn't even think about such things.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next morning. Wang Ling woke up from a very solid sleep.</p>

    <p>When he woke up, he saw Er Ha standing next to him in human form with her buttocks bare...</p>

    <p>And he was actually held by the bed he had enlightened.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood up and glanced at Er Ha in surprise.</p>

    <p>Although this is not the first time I know that Er Ha is covered in green, it still feels a bit strange in his human form.</p>

    <p>Er Ha covered her key parts. The expression on her face was extremely helpless: "This... you can't blame me!"</p>

    <p>He explained to Wang Ling a series of situations currently occurring.</p>

    <p>"Can't change back?" Wang Ling was surprised to hear this. To stay in human form and not be able to change back... The point is that Er Ha is still reaching out. It doesn't make sense that this would happen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Feeling. Today's world seems a little weird.</p>

    <p>He opened the door to the bedroom's built-in bathroom.</p>

    <p>Then I was surprised to find that there was actually a room full of people in the originally empty bathroom...</p>

    <p>The spirits who were enlightened by him actually maintained their human form and were unable to change back.</p>

    <p>Wash basin, toothbrush cup.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma looked at Wang Ling. The expression on his face was a little awkward: "Master, do you want to go to the toilet... If you don't mind... I..." He said. Lord Ma opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked by this scene. She silently closed the bathroom door.</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>I think there's something wrong with the way the door was opened...</p>

    <p>But what is the current situation? Even Wang Ling himself doesn't know very well.</p>

    <p>"Great Enlightenment Technique" is relatively mature. Unlike "Single Spell", which always has "bugs", this should not happen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the door to find Father Wang and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>As a result, I was surprised to find two cute maids wearing maid uniforms and unicorn horns standing on either side of Father Wang in the living room.</p>

    <p>One is named Kato.</p>

    <p>One is named Eagle.</p>

    <p>This is the left and right hand that was given to Father Wang last time to deal with Fenmu Shen...Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, I would grow from a unicorn arm to a unicorn maid.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling...did you do this?" The expression on Father Wang's face was indescribably complicated. He didn't know whether he should be happy or sad.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head. He immediately denied it.</p>

    <p>He became like this when he woke up. Who knows what happened...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the maid named "Kato" on the left forked a piece of fruit and handed it to Father Wang's mouth. When Father Wang opened his mouth, his mouth turned into a huge eagle's beak.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he had seen it wrong. He reached up and touched it. It turned out that Father Wang had really turned into an eagle.</p>

    <p>Still an eagle without wings.</p>

    <p>Because both his left and right hands have become maids...</p>

    <p>"There's nothing particularly uncomfortable about it." At this time, Father Wang said seriously: "I don't have any hands anymore. So I can ask for leave from my book friends and say that I can't write anymore."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he blushed and glanced at the Qilin maids on his left and right: "And I think this is pretty good..."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A "whoop" sound came from behind the sofa.</p>

    <p>A huge white tiger appeared and immediately bit Father Wang's eagle head...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang turned into a white tiger...</p>
