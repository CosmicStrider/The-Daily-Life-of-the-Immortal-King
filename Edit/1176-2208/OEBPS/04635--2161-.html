  <h1>Chapter 2161 Imagination limits the realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Fenhai...</p>

    <p>Is this something that ordinary people can do?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was wearing casual clothes for going out, with his trouser pockets inserted. He looked at an aisle that was completely exposed in front of him. It was cleared by the sea water and sighed slightly.</p>

    <p>The movement this time was slightly louder.</p>

    <p>If anyone calls up satellite surveillance to look at their location at this time, they will see an ocean area on the earth, just like the barber in the barber shop who shaved his head with shaking hands, leaving a bald patch.</p>

    <p>This is not the evaporation of sea water. It is the division of the sea.</p>

    <p>As for the power of dividing the sea, it is indeed difficult for normal monks to achieve it.</p>

    <p>This requires a huge amount of spiritual power to pull every drop of sea water to achieve such an effect. The Dao God realm can do it. But it cannot achieve the scale of manipulation like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If it's like Monk Jin Deng's ancestral realm, it's probably about the same.</p>

    <p>However, dividing the sea is an act that greatly depletes one's own qi sea. The spiritual energy sea is the spiritual power reserve source of the cultivator. After the consumption is completed, it needs to be replenished by sitting cross-legged and adjusting the breath.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the move of dividing the sea is indeed very cool. But the cost of being cool is that the subsequent benefits often outweigh the losses.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone's air sea area can be the same as Wang Ling. It is as big as a black hole.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stared at the two people exposed and shivering on the clean sea bed. He sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>It feels like I don't have to pretend. It's great...</p>

    <p>This time he dared to do this. Mainly because Wang Ming was behind him and blocked the satellite camera aimed at this area.</p>

    <p>In other words, in the map scene in front of me, except for Xiong Wu and Zhu?, there will be no third person who knows about him.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ling will feel relieved.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, actually doing this once in a while is actually good for Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>The new version of Talisman is still under development.</p>

    <p>The existing Talisman's suppression power is weakening day by day. In order to prolong the life of the old Talisman, Wang Ming's suggestion to Wang Ling is that he should do a wave every day or every other day, which can consume a lot of his own spiritual energy and accumulate it in the sea. Aura. A spell that won't cause too much damage.</p>

    <p>Divide the Sea. In fact, even this type of spell is used.</p>

    <p>Visually very intimidating.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the principle of dividing the sea is just the traction technique. It is not that high-end.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, facing such a shocking scene, Xiong Wu and Zhu Xi, who were old-school Itinerant Immortals, had already hugged each other.</p>

    <p>They were really frightened.</p>

    <p>I never thought why a boy who was only sixteen or seventeen years old could be so defiant...</p>

    <p>"Brother...what should we do...this person...at least is a True Immortal!"</p>

    <p>Zhu? was so frightened that his legs trembled. Infinite fear covered him and lingered in his heart, making him feel overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu's situation is even worse than Zhu Xi's.</p>

    <p>True Immortal...</p>

    <p>He even felt that Zhu?s imagination was still a bit too conservative.</p>

    <p>This young man was so terrifying. He directly divided the entire sea along both sides. And the key was that they could not see the end of the seabed as far as their naked eyes could see.</p>

    <p>This shows that the actual sea area separated by Juvenile is very large. If there are satellite images, we should be able to see the changes at this level very clearly.</p>

    <p>So now the question arises. Did this boy exist on the earth before the earth was upgraded? Or did he appear after the earth was upgraded?</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu prefers the latter...</p>

    <p>He even felt that Wang Ling was not human at all.</p>

    <p>Only aliens have such strength, right?</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the earth's human monks just ignored him on their way to upgrading and evolving!</p>

    <p>For a time, the two of them had a lot of thoughts in their minds.</p>

    <p>Faced with a huge gap in strength, it is no longer possible to escape.</p>

    <p>I saw Xiong Wu and Zhu Hu looking at each other for a moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally wanted to divide the sea water into two waves to form a water whip to tie the two people in front of him from a distance.</p>

    <p>The next second, the two people actually took the starting position of track and field athletes at the same time and ran towards him.</p>

    <p>When they got close, they braked with one knee. The two people came from the middle position, sliding and kneeling close to each other along the seabed...</p>

    <p>Their movements were uniform, as if they had been rehearsed in advance. Wang Ling was also shocked.</p>

    <p>"Go to Immortal and spare your life!"</p>

    <p>The two people stopped neatly in front of Wang Ling. Then they plunged their heads directly into the beach.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling waved his hand and closed the sea behind him again. The seawater overlapped again and formed huge waves, which hit the beach and made both of them wet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought the two of them would resist for a while. I didn't expect the surrender to be so complete.</p>

    <p>He sighed slightly. Then he looked at the blue sky. In his ears, he heard the sound of a helicopter patrolling in the distance. This was the International Cultivation Detective that Wang Ming contacted.</p>

    <p>At the same time, monk Jin Deng appeared here first.</p>

    <p>"Leave the rest to the poor monk." Monk Jin Deng remained as serious as ever.</p>

    <p>He took over Wang Ling's shift.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling jumped off the Snow Mecha. He left the mecha with Jin Deng. Then he patted him on the shoulder. Then he disappeared directly on the beach.</p>

    <p>After all, the capture of members of the Four Elephants was just a sideshow. He still had to go back and continue playing games with Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming should have saved a file for him.</p>

    <p>But after returning this time, Wang Ling felt that he couldn't hide the fact that he was not an NPC.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone in Sixiang has been brought to justice.</p>

    <p>Two people were seriously injured. It looked like they couldn't be saved.</p>

    <p>Zhu Yu and Xiong Wu surrendered in time, so they are still breathing.</p>

    <p>At this time, the two kneeling people saw Wang Ling completing the handover with Monk Jin Deng. The evil thoughts they had just given up in their hearts suddenly arose again.</p>

    <p>After this earth is upgraded, how many people will be promoted to Venerated Immortal...</p>

    <p>Even if they were unlucky and met a monster, it wouldn't be difficult to offend even this monk, right?</p>

    <p>They knelt on the ground, making calculations secretly in their hearts. They were thinking about whether to continue running away.</p>

    <p>As a result, the monk put his hands together.</p>

    <p>Golden light emanates from the Buddha's palm.</p>

    <p>A huge golden shadow of the Buddha appeared behind the monk. Only Zhu Xi and Xiong Wu could see it.</p>

    <p>"Could this be...Dharma image..."</p>

    <p>Zhu Xi and Xiong Wu were shocked again.</p>

    <p>They know what it is.</p>

    <p>It was also the first time for the two of them to see such a giant Dharma Buddha, which was as huge as a mountain.</p>

    <p>However, this is not the end.</p>

    <p>I saw monk Jin Deng facing the two of them and silently reciting "Namo Amitabha." The size of the golden Buddha behind him doubled again. It gradually expanded to the sky. www.uukanshu.net A pair of Buddha eyes appeared from the universe. Outside. Staring at them.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhu? and Xiong Wu felt a mysterious universe and the fear of alien objects from the sky at the same time...</p>

    <p>"Senior...senior brother..."</p>

    <p>"Hey. It seems that we have been stuck in our ways for too long. We are completely out of touch with the modern cultivation society..."</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu sighed.</p>

    <p>He never dared to think otherwise.</p>

    <p>He directly pulled Zhu? and kowtowed to the monk together.</p>

    <p>"The holy monk will be merciful. We will never think of escaping again..." Xiong Wu said almost with a cry.</p>

    <p>This feeling of powerlessness.</p>

    <p>It left him embarrassed and helpless.</p>
