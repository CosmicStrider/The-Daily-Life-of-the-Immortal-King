  <h1>Chapter 1998: Really inserted an eye</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling knows that screen snooping is actually very bad. Normally, he tries his best to avoid screen snooping. But sometimes, he just happens to catch it. Even he himself has no way to undo it.</p>

    <p>He has had the two Cosmic Embryo in his hands for a while. But after all, they are products of the old days. So far Wang Ling, apart from using these things as galactic-level telescopes, has not found any other use.</p>

    <p>These two things are actually quite dangerous. The cosmic energy contained in them is huge. Not only spiritual energy, but also mixed with other kinds of energy. All mixed together.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, both Cosmic Embryo are now in the hands of Wang Ling. If the fetus is allowed to be in the hands of those evil people in the universe, who knows whether they will use the power of these things to launch an invasion of the earth?</p>

    <p>"Can it be destroyed?" At this time, Er Ha was lying on the ground and yawned lazily.</p>

    <p>It raises a very soulful question.</p>

    <p>"I have thought about it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling touched his chin. He replied in a calm voice.</p>

    <p>These two things were extraordinary. Anyway, he didn't know what their specific functions were. Wang Ling thought it would be more convenient to destroy them directly.</p>

    <p>However, once the energy of these two things detonates, the scope of the impact will be large. This is infinitely more terrifying than a nuclear bomb... The power of the explosion is not even on the same level.</p>

    <p>Destroying two pieces of Cosmic Embryo. Wang Ling has the ability to do so. But it would be a bit bad if it destroyed these two things and affected other races in the universe.</p>

    <p>Plus Wang Ling actually has an intuition.</p>

    <p>He feels that this can play a key role in Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>"This thing stays with you. It's safe and dangerous." Er Ha couldn't help but sigh. Wang Ling certainly has the ability to protect this Cosmic Embryo from foreign enemies.</p>

    <p>But the problem is that the Little Master Ling is also a bomb... and if it explodes, its power may not be lower than the explosion power of the Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>If this fails, it will definitely not be a problem of the earth disappearing.</p>

    <p>Three bombs come together. The universe will be directly blown up. It may also affect other parallel universes.</p>

    <p>"That's not the point."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's voice came. He gradually condensed into an entity from a group of shadows. He appeared directly on the back of Wang Ling like a stand-in. At the same time, his voice was still cold: "Didn't the saint say that. These two are now a transmitter. Keep it in our hands. Although it can ensure its safety, it will also attract the attention of other races in the universe."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was immediately silenced by these words.</p>

    <p>He thought back then, how confident the demon saint of the demon clan was. But in the end, he was still subdued by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It feels that these cosmic races are still too young. They don't know how terrifying this blue planet is...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling still doesn't know how those cosmic races can sense the signal from this pair of Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>But as the saints said, the current Cosmic Embryo is equivalent to a transmitter that constantly attracts firepower. It is safe to keep it in your own hands, but it will also cause a series of problems.</p>

    <p>"There is a way."</p>

    <p>After sitting cross-legged on the ground for a moment, Wang Ling suddenly had an idea.</p>

    <p>He concentrated the spiritual power in his palm and slammed it towards the ground. The spiritual spell engraved in the center of his palm instantly spread from the ground to the surroundings like a spider web.</p>

    <p>Along with the golden light rising at the same time, the familiar glass cabinet was summoned to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yes. This is a display cabinet unique to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Previously, in order to decipher the mysterious text from eternity, Wang Ling had also summoned it.</p>

    <p>There are a total of forty-nine pairs of gods eyes in the display cabinet. They are variables of the Tao. Each pair of gods eyes has completely different abilities.</p>

    <p>Last time Wang Ling chose "Pupil Number 01: The Cunning Peeping Demonic Eye" in order to decipher the mysterious text. But this time he chose "Eye Number 03: The Revival of the True Spiritual Eye." Appearance Appearing silvery white. The pupils are crescent-shaped. It has strong copying ability. It can achieve the effect of making fakes look like real ones."</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling selected this pair of gods, Wang Ying explained to Er Ha at the same time.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Er Ha knew what Wang Ling wanted to do: "I understand. It turns out that you want to reproduce the divergent signals of the Cosmic Embryo... to give those cosmic races an illusion?"</p>

    <p>"You only half-guessed it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying crossed his arms and immediately answered: "In fact, Cosmic Embryo is included in the Lord's King's Eyes. And King's Eyes forms its own universe. In this way, Cosmic Embryo's signal is in an isolated state. Now Let the master reproduce the divergent signal of Cosmic Embryo. The main purpose is to send the pair of Number 03 to the Saints."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. That's it." Hearing this, Er Ha couldn't hold it back and burst out laughing immediately.</p>

    <p>This is the way of giving to the other side. Give it back to the other side.</p>

    <p>The saints in the temple over there also hope that because of the Cosmic Embryo on the earth, other alien races will come looking for it and invade the earth. This will make the Wang Ling's side have no time to take care of themselves and weaken the overall strength.</p>

    <p>However, they did not expect that Wang Ling would hear all their plans.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Wang Ling even directly reproduced the divergent signal of Cosmic Embryo. It redirected the attention of the entire universe to the hands of this saint.</p>

    <p>"go..."</p>

    <p>After completing all the arrangements, Wang Ling raised his sword fingers and used gravity to open the window. The engraved eye pupil Number 03 turned into two golden light spots and quickly flew out. Shrunk to an inch, flying towards the holy clansman's temple at extremely high speed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calculated the time.</p>

    <p>From the earth to the holy temple of the infinite galaxy. It can be reached in about ten minutes of earth time at the flight speed of Number 03.</p>

    <p>"I really look forward to what kind of confused expression this Saint clan member will show in the future." Er Ha squatted on the ground and looked out the window. It thought it had long been familiar with the strength of its little master. But today Wang Ling can still bring all kinds of outrageous freshness to it.</p>

    <p>This is directly inserting an eye into the head of the Saint people...</p>

    <p>And this eye, even if the saints use a scanner, they can't eliminate it!</p>

    <p>Er Ha can completely imagine what surprises the Saints will receive next.</p>

    <p>This kind of surprise is like walking on the road in the middle of the night and finding someone following you all the way.</p>

    <p>Out of fear. Your pace starts to quicken.</p>

    <p>However, his pace also quickened.</p>

    <p>Finally. The person following you did nothing.</p>

    <p>He just shouted into your ear: "EDG won the championship. EDG is awesome..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He shook his dog's head and interrupted his meaningless thoughts. Er Ha quickly turned his gaze to Wang Ling: "I heard that Zhuo Yi over there is still thinking of ways to help Jiugong Liangzi. I thought you would leave this clan matter to him."</p>

    <p>Resisting the invasion of powerful aliens. This is essentially an outstanding contribution. And it is not just for the Huaxiu country... it is beneficial to all human cultivators. It is for the improvement of this pattern. The upper level It will no longer be difficult for Jiugong Liangzi to follow up.</p>

    <p>"The situation is different. This Saint clan member is too strong. The Lord is worried that all the blame will be given to Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi if they can't deal with them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying flicked his fingers and said: "However, there are other ways. For example, let Jiugong participate in this Earth Center project. She is still an exchange student at Number 60 High School, and her student status is still at Number 60 High School for the time being."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
