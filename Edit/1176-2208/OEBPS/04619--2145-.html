  <h1>Chapter 2145 The top players in the gaming world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The In front of a huge secret altar. Many guild members gathered here. A giant Hei Long corpse a hundred feet long was dumped in front of everyone. The blood protruding from its mouth directly turned into a lake of blood. Its body shape was like a stretching mountain. After struggling for a while, he finally died.</p>

    <p>This is the Hei Long Cave secret realm with a recommended challenge level of level 65 in the Itinerant Immortal spell ring. There is no level restriction for entering the dungeon. However, there will be a forced kill mechanism. Players who enter this dungeon with a level lower than 55 will be subject to 5 attacks from the dungeon monsters. Doubles the damage and increases the probability of abnormal status by 1x...</p>

    <p>Therefore, the players gathered here are at least level 55 or above.</p>

    <p>The giant Hei Long is the big boss of the dungeon. After being attacked by several guilds and hundreds of players in total, Hei Long finally fell.</p>

    <p>The huge body of Hei Long was dumped in front of everyone. The shock was self-evident. The monks who had never seen a dragon in modern times experienced the feeling of slaying a dragon.</p>

    <p>According to the previous challenge rules, after everyone works together to kill the large boss, the presidents of several major guilds will roll the dice as representatives.</p>

    <p>It's still the old rules. Three dice. People with more dice points can have priority to touch Hei Long's corpse. The selection is made by the system according to the number of people in the entire copy. The treasure chests will be distributed fairly.</p>

    <p>After the president has selected the treasure box, he can return to the guild and let the members participating in this instance continue to roll the dice. Continue to click on the treasure box in order and get an item from the treasure box at random.</p>

    <p>The level 65 Hei Long Cave is a rare high-difficulty dungeon in the Itinerant Immortal game world. The difficulty rating reaches 15 stars.</p>

    <p>Survival difficulty:★★★★★</p>

    <p>Reward index:★★★★★</p>

    <p>Boss difficulty:★★★★★</p>

    <p>Faced with such a dungeon, it is still very difficult to do it with the power of one guild at this stage, because no guild can find that many players with a game level of 55 or above.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at this stage, cooperative challenges between guilds have become the only option to challenge high-difficulty dungeons.</p>

    <p>A flying elephant covered with armor. The huge tusks curled upwards like a horn. A majestic man carrying a giant sword laughed loudly after rolling the dice: "I'm sorry, everyone. This time, the box will be given priority. Look. Here we come again, the Four Elephants."</p>

    <p>He was very lucky. He just rolled the key and got 18 points. The probability of such a leopard point was very low. After seeing this, the other guild leaders shook their heads and sighed.</p>

    <p>This is the result of the system's judgment. It is impossible to cheat. So they are very helpless.</p>

    <p>When the next few presidents threw, they saw that no one was there and the sieve threw another eighteen points. The man riding the armored flying elephant drove his mount across the blood lake and flew towards Hei Long's body.</p>

    <p>"This Xiongwu. Why is he so lucky every time?" Many guild leaders were suspicious when they saw this scene. Several of their guilds and the Four Elephants had downloaded dungeons several times. Although each time they successfully killed the final Boss. Even though the process is difficult, Xiong Wu, the guild leader of Sixiangzhong, is the first to collect the treasure chest every time.</p>

    <p>The key is that the points are determined by the system. Itinerant Immortal's cheating method is notoriously strict, so it is completely unrealistic to say it is cheating.</p>

    <p>"It's better to recruit talents quickly. As long as you don't cooperate with them in the future." A guild leader said. He was riding on a white horse with wings. The flying mane of the horse looked very silky. The whole body was shining. It has silver lines. It looks very extraordinary.</p>

    <p>He is the president of the White Horse Guild. Li Bai.</p>

    <p>The entire White Horse Guild is almost all stargazing Taoist players.</p>

    <p>He is an indispensable and important member of the next dungeon. Most of the stargazing Taoist priest's professional skills are related to perception. In order to improve the survivability in high-difficulty dungeons, stargazing players are usually required to explore and clear the way to eliminate dangers ahead.</p>

    <p>"Hey. But without them now, it would be impossible for us to challenge Hei Long Cave alone." Another guild leader sighed.</p>

    <p>President of the Shanye Villagers Guild. Mangshan.</p>

    <p>He lives up to his name. His profession is a rural roughneck. This is one of the professions that is very suitable for novices to open up wasteland. He has rough skin and thick flesh. In the key start, you can also choose to bring a spiritual beast as a partner.</p>

    <p>Professional skills are related to the domestication of spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>A high-level rural wild man player can even directly tame the spirit beasts that appear in the dungeon in high-difficulty dungeons to become his own combat power. Although the spirit beasts in the dungeon cannot be taken out of the dungeon, it is indeed the key to increasing combat power in disguise.</p>

    <p>At the same time, these domesticated dungeon spirit beasts can also be used as tool beasts for pathfinding in conjunction with the professional skills of the stargazing Taoist priests. For this reason, the exchanges between the two presidents of the White Horse Guild and the Yamano Murakuo Guild are very close.</p>

    <p>One can provide combat power and human shield. The other can be used to detect paths, sense and avoid risks. It seems to be a perfect combination. However, it does not work when facing high-difficulty dungeons.</p>

    <p>They rely on Sixiangzhong. This is a last resort.</p>

    <p>After all, the current leader of the Four Elephants Guild, Xiong Wu, is a representative player of the violent sword immortal genre. He can provide huge output.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Xue Hu, the vice-president of the Four Elephants Guild, also completed the faction switch under Xiong Wu's guidance and became the most popular feudal sword immortal.</p>

    <p>Almost all the most popular schools in the entire immortal sword profession were founded by Xiong Wu, the president of the Four Elephants. This made everyone in the audience convinced.</p>

    <p>The key is that my luck is ridiculously biased. I can open the treasure chest first every time. What is the principle and mechanism of this? It makes the guild leader in the field very depressed.</p>

    <p>The current dilemma is that they have to rely on the violent output and sealing capabilities provided by Immortal players. And they cannot get rid of it in the short term.</p>

    <p>In the past few days, except for the Four Elephants Guild, the other guild leaders are actually saving their lives. They are thinking about whether they can get rid of the Four Elephants and prepare a game alone to challenge the Hei Long Cave.</p>

    <p>But in fact the result has always been failure.</p>

    <p>Even if they worked hard to get to the final boss level, without the violent output of the Four Elephant Guild Leader's sword, the damage would still be so low.</p>

    <p>Even though this is a game world, a situation where one family dominates is not what the other guild leaders want to see. The sword immortal profession was originally a common profession, but now it has almost been outplayed by these people from the Four Elephants.</p>

    <p>And most Sword Immortal players will choose to join the Four Elephants. Li Bai, the president of the White Horse Guild, thinks this is a very bad trend.</p>

    <p>"This Four Symbols Group was not a good organization in the real world. But now it has become famous here. Isn't this an attempt to whitewash the Four Symbols Group?" Li Bai sighed.</p>

    <p>His impression of the Four Symbols was not very good to begin with, because he knew about the history of the Wuji Sword Sect in the real world. This was a branch of the sword sect founded by the evil sword immortal Evil Jian Shen.</p>

    <p>Who is the Evil Jian Shen?</p>

    <p>An arrogant person who deceives his master and destroys his ancestors. Even the few direct disciples of the Four Elephants that he established did all kinds of evil. As a result, someone created a guild like the Four Elephants in the game world. Even the name of the guild president was unknown. Replicate the names of wanted criminals.</p>

    <p>This made Li Bai very suspicious whether those people behind the manipulation of game accounts could really be members of the Four Elephants in reality.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately. He has no evidence.</p>

    <p>And if he expresses his opinions directly like this, there may be a risk of being made irresponsible remarks, thinking that he cannot afford to play, and directly isolating him.</p>

    <p>"Since the two presidents are so troubled, have you ever thought about taking the initiative to seek cooperation?"</p>

    <p>Just when Li Bai and Mang Shan were having headaches, a player with six-character bangs appeared in front of them. This man bowed and was polite.</p>

    <p>What surprised the two of them the most was that they discovered that this player was only level 30!</p>

    <p>"Oh my god... Level 30... Guigui. How did you survive here?"</p>

    <p>Mangshan felt incredible.</p>

    <p>In the past, there were actually low-level players in the guild who joined the team to gain experience. Neither Li Bai nor Mang Shan objected. Although they usually died directly in the early and middle stages of the dungeon before they could survive.</p>

    <p>After all, players whose level is lower than 55 will have a mandatory punishment mechanism. They will receive 5 times the damage from the monsters in the dungeon and double the probability of abnormal status.</p>

    <p>Anyone who can survive to the last level below level 55 is indeed a talent.</p>

    <p>Li Bai glanced at the visitor's message.</p>

    <p>This is still a member of his White Horse Guild. But his chosen profession is not a stargazing Taoist priest. Instead, he is a rare sealer.</p>

    <p>The Sealer is recognized as one of the most difficult initial professions. Because he needs to collect keys in the game world and open the ancient broken ancient scrolls that come with him. The health is also very low. He also has to run around to open the ancient scrolls. It is very easy. will die.</p>

    <p>Therefore, very few people choose this profession.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in the eyes of many people, the profession of sealer itself has a mysterious veil.</p>

    <p>"Just good luck. I just used a little bit of positioning."</p>

    <p>The man smiled. He bowed and said, "If the two presidents are short of talents, I think we might as well take the initiative to seek cooperation. I would like to recommend Fuyun Town. The two presidents, maybe you can go to Fuyun Town and take a look."</p>
