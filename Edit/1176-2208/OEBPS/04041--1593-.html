  <h1>Chapter 1593 Death Bell for Judgment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling rolled up his sleeves and put on an expression like he was going to do something big.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui's first reaction was naturally astonishment.</p>

    <p>Even though he had just refreshed his understanding of Wang Ling's strength not long ago.</p>

    <p>But he doesn't think that Wang Ling can take down the entire palace of the Outer Gods with one punch.</p>

    <p>But now, seeing Wang Ling brushing up his sleeves, Zhang Zhui deeply realized that he still underestimated Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Why does such a terrifying young man exist in this universe?</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui saw Wang Ling's King's Eyes before, he actually had some suspicions in his mind.</p>

    <p>Because he can see that King's Eyes is not in the Dao. It can't be copied by the Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the first thing Zhang Zhui thought of was "a product of the past."</p>

    <p>If King's Eyes is connected to the Old Dominator civilization in the ancient universe...</p>

    <p>Then everything will fall into place.</p>

    <p>After coming to the conclusion, Zhang Zhui followed suit. At first he suspected that Wang Ling was not a normal human cultivator...</p>

    <p>He felt that Wang Ling most likely had the bloodline of the Old Dominator from the ancient universe era.</p>

    <p>But now, Zhang Zhui feels that his conclusion is completely wrong.</p>

    <p>Although there are wars and predators in Old Dominator.</p>

    <p>But a place like the Palace of the Outer Gods symbolizes the supreme right of the king!</p>

    <p>It is a symbolic product that represents the glory of the ancient universe civilization of Old Dominator. Just like the Feng Shui dragon veins believed in by ancient human cultivators when they established their empire.</p>

    <p>No matter how hard we fight, no one will do something like this... This is an act that destroys the foundation of faith and race.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling called him out, he had passed two levels in a row.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui originally thought that this was because King's Eyes might be a product of the past. Therefore, he had a smooth journey in the palace of the outer gods as if he was cheating.</p>

    <p>But now. After seeing how poorly Old Dominator treats humans. He's actually going to punch the entire Outer God's Palace from the inside.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Is it really possible?</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui is completely confused now.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling is also gathering strength.</p>

    <p>He knew that it would not be easy to disintegrate the palace of the outer gods from the inside. Therefore, this punch must pay special attention to its weight.</p>

    <p>Normally, my attack is relatively casual. I'm afraid it won't be enough to deal with the Palace of Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>Yes, of course. Wang Ling also pondered whether or not to shed his Talisman.</p>

    <p>He thinks it can be revealed. But it's not necessary.</p>

    <p>It's just a house that got knocked down. It's not as if we have to expose Talisman.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, his fist condensed with golden light. Countless powers of chaos gathered in the center of his fist like a whirlpool.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the nearby space boiled!</p>

    <p>The mist of reality generated in the space of The Mirror of Reality was dispelled by the golden light condensed by the boy.</p>

    <p>At the position of his fist, Zhang Zhui could clearly feel that the concentration of chaos was soaring.</p>

    <p>Chaos is originally purple-black. Only when the concentration reaches a limit will it turn into gold!</p>

    <p>"It can reach this point..." Zhang Zhui was completely shocked. He never expected that the concentration of chaos condensed by Wang Ling at this moment has far exceeded that of Dao Ancestor Wang back then! It only took a few seconds. This has gathered together The concentration of chaos is already an astronomical figure that cannot be technically achieved!</p>

    <p>Tens of thousands of times more terrifying than Dao Ancestor Wang back then!</p>

    <p>And... this is just the beginning!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still has not reached its extreme value!</p>

    <p>"Dong!"</p>

    <p>The melodious bell rang.</p>

    <p>It was not the sound from the palace of the outer gods. It was a powerful wave transmitted from the center of the universe. It had a special resonance with Wang Ling at this moment.</p>

    <p>Now, not only Zhang Zhui, but also the other eternal warriors in the Corpse Map could not sit still.</p>

    <p>They looked at the scene in front of them in astonishment.</p>

    <p>But I saw a faint golden outline emerging behind the young man. Supreme and supreme! A golden dharma ring on the head and golden chaotic mist on the feet!</p>

    <p>It was just an outline of a face that could not be seen clearly. But it caused countless Eternal-level experts in the Corpse Map to fall into a short-circuit in their minds...</p>

    <p>Because they know. It looks like a double. What is this thing behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This... this is the Dharma! The Dharma of this young man... is actually the spirit of the universe?" Wrapped in the Corpse Map. Many ancient powerful men couldn't help but kneel down at this moment.</p>

    <p>This is not because they want to kneel down. It is a natural reaction produced by their bodies after seeing the spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>This is the most powerful Dharma object!</p>

    <p>Symbolizes a kind of supreme, noble and endless power!</p>

    <p>"Dong!"</p>

    <p>Just when everyone was lost in thought, the second bell sounded again.</p>

    <p>This is the fluctuation that occurs after the spirit of the universe appears. It is like the sound of a bell. In fact, it is the result of powerful energy diffusing in the universe.</p>

    <p>If the universe is viewed as a harp, then the major planets in the universe are the strings on the harp.</p>

    <p>Then the spirit of the universe of Wang Ling is the one who plays the strings.</p>

    <p>When the third bell rang, even greater fluctuations came out. The surrounding time and space were all chaotic. The sound of the bell was like a countdown that echoed throughout the universe!</p>

    <p>It indicates that something big is about to happen.</p>

    <p>"This is the Death Bell for Judgment..." Zhang Zhui was quite surprised.</p>

    <p>Because he only knew about Death Bell for Judgment from Dao Ancestor Wang's notes before.</p>

    <p>At that time, Dao Ancestor Wang also used great power to try to summon the spirit of his own Dharma to cause fluctuations, and then activated the Death Bell for Judgment.</p>

    <p>But Dao Ancestor Wang failed in the end. It did not succeed.</p>

    <p>God knows. This scene will actually happen here.</p>

    <p>"Death Bell for Judgment? What is this?" wrapped in Corpse Map. Someone asked.</p>

    <p>Not all Eternal level experts have the experience and knowledge of Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>"That's... a ruling from the universe... representing a kind of chaotic will..." Zhang Zhui explained. In fact, he couldn't tell what it was.</p>

    <p>But every time Death Bell for Judgment sounds, it gives people an unspeakable feeling of heart palpitations.</p>

    <p>It was a feeling as if the universe was about to collapse...</p>

    <p>All the fear, shock, and confusion were all added up. It only took a few seconds for Wang Ling to accumulate power.</p>

    <p>During the buildup. The laws of the palace of the Outer Gods found a discrepancy. They attempted to destroy Wang Ling with the power of the Outer Divine Order by condensing the Chaos Reinforcement. However, it was consumed by the Spirit of the Universe.</p>

    <p>The outline of this void. At this moment it manifests itself as the supreme seat of supremacy.</p>

    <p>"I'm ready.." When Wang Ling opened his eyes. A destructive punch came out of his hand!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A huge penetrating beam of light emanates from Wang Ling's fist. It points straight into the void ahead. It is a power condensed from the center of the universe. Wherever the fist light passes, everything is collapsing!</p>

    <p>The space of The Mirror of Reality was shattered on the spot. The mist was purified by the golden light.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the fifth ring of the Death Bell for Judgment. Wherever this punch passed, everything was being destroyed and collapsed...</p>
