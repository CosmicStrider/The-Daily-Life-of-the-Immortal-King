  <h1>Chapter 2123 As if seeing the future</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, there have been many times. Wang Ling felt that Sun Rong was really a very patient girl. In the past, he thought Sun Rong would only put on a mask in front of him and restrain himself. It is as perfect as everyone imagined. There is no difference in the perfection.</p>

    <p>But now, this on-site teaching to the eighteen children of the General's Mansion has made Wang Ling completely abandon that old concept. Because now Sun Rong has no idea of his true identity. But he still Be patient and carry out your teaching work.</p>

    <p>Previously Wang Ling had tried to find an intermediate talent among this group of children. Then they matched the appropriate third-level spells and then taught them. It turned out that Sun Rong's teaching method was smarter than his own.</p>

    <p>She did not directly teach the Heart Sutra, spells, swordsmanship, knife skills or anything like that. Instead, she started from the basics. She taught... functions.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, time is just a small subject in functions. It is the study of the landing point of a parabola.</p>

    <p>It must be understood that in the world of cultivation, throwing hidden weapons or flying spells requires precision in throwing. If you can't hit the target if you have the ability, it will be in vain.</p>

    <p>Therefore, parabola in functions is also classified as a basic discipline. It is also called {parabola}.</p>

    <p>And according to the theoretical system of modern education, this course can be upgraded. Unlike other fixed-level spells, the disciplines are different. The level can be upgraded based on the throwing accuracy of {Parabolism}. The highest level is three.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he saw Sun Rong teaching by words and deeds Wang Ling that he realized the limitations of his thinking model... He only thought about taking the high-level route. But he missed this basic course.</p>

    <p>Even though he has thousands of spells, they are all based on Heavenly Dao after all. Even if he is sure to teach these eighteen children, it will definitely take a long time.</p>

    <p>The key point is that these children in the General's Mansion have become accustomed to being unruly. Although they appear to be well-behaved on the surface, they are somewhat resistant in their hearts. This will lead to intentional failure to learn.</p>

    <p>That is to say, even if you understand it and know that you can do it, you are not willing to learn it.</p>

    <p>But {Parabolism} is different. Throwing classes don't have to be rigid. They are usually very interesting. For this group of naughty children, it is just the right course for them.</p>

    <p>{Projection} From the first level to the third level, the fundamental thing is accuracy. For this group of naughty children, they have certain throwing skills. Because they usually have a lot of things to take when they lose their temper or get into fights. Hit people.</p>

    <p>Originally, it was impossible for them to obey the orders of a guard. But now Wang Ling, the "old father" who is a general, has acquiesced to the guard teaching here. In addition, they are deeply tired of standing in a military posture. I just want to move around.</p>

    <p>Now I heard the lesson taught by this guard again. It was the "hidden weapon throwing" that they were familiar with. Suddenly, everyone's expressions lit up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked his subordinates to bring sandbags from the house. And the basic teaching of Wang Ling started with these sandbags.</p>

    <p>Eighteen children, one older and one younger, were divided into nine groups. Just like that, the sandbag throwing battle with the entire General Mansion as the map officially began.</p>

    <p>For children, this isn't training at all. It's just a game.</p>

    <p>Everyone had a great time playing.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu's part-time job ended quickly and smoothly. Ten items were appraised, and none of them were travel expenses. Including bonuses, he received a total of 20 ingots of silver. With so much money at his side, not only was his travel expenses sufficient, but also You can also grab a nice portable meal on the way there.</p>

    <p>He came to the inn in the town, bought ten beef bladders and six gourds of jade spirit dew, and equipped them directly on his body. These things were enough to allow him to resist hunger for a long time and restore his blood volume and fatigue.</p>

    <p>Directly emptied the innkeeper's reserve for the day.</p>

    <p>Total consumption. 1 ingot of silver.</p>

    <p>In the Itinerant Immortal infantry ring, the smaller the food, the more expensive it is. But on the map in front of you, beef bladders and jade spirit dew are already the best choices.</p>

    <p>The items sold in each major map are based on the technological level of the region. In the Itinerant Immortal magic ring, the level of the regions varies.</p>

    <p>After all, there is a relatively futuristic place like Machinery City.</p>

    <p>You can no longer find products of the old era such as inns in such places. Instead, there are various 24-hour convenience stores. What they sell there are smaller but more expensive bento boxes, etc.</p>

    <p>Hunger was solved. What was left was the cold problem. Mr. Canghu calculated the time. If he hired a convoy to go to the illuminated resource map from now on, it would probably be midnight. If there is not enough food by then, Keep warm. He could easily starve to death in such a naked state.</p>

    <p>So in desperation, Mr. Canghu had to spend four more coins. He went to the spirit beast shop and bought a set of equipment for spirit beasts to wear on his body.</p>

    <p>Universal spirit animal scarf (green), universal spirit animal soft armor (green), universal spirit animal boots (white)</p>

    <p>Four ingots of silver. In exchange for two pieces of green equipment and one piece of white equipment. The average price is twice as expensive as the equipment of a human monk.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu felt that it was not very cost-effective. But for the sake of subsequent tasks, he had to endure it...</p>

    <p>As far as he knows, pet products are all IQ taxed. In fact, their functions are not that great. Just like some pet-specific shower gels and shampoos... In fact, there is no need at all. There is no problem at all in replacing them for human use.</p>

    <p>He spent five ingots of silver to solve the problem of food and clothing. Mr. Canghu found the convoy in Huanglong Town again. He made a follow-up map for himself. He will not come to Huanglong Town again. After the resources are collected, he must find a larger one. cities sell their products.</p>

    <p>But now the map is almost completely dark. Except for Huanglong Town and the resource area where he was lit up, Mr. Canghu really doesn't have much idea of where to go.</p>

    <p>Blind boxes can only be opened in surrounding areas close to the resource area.</p>

    <p>Because according to common sense, cities closer to resource areas will be more developed. At the same time, he also paid attention to whether the next city he selected had waterways.</p>

    <p>If there is a place like a port, it can also explain the strength of this place in a sense.</p>

    <p>After the final discussion, the task of the convoy includes safely delivering Mr. Canghu to the resource area. Then camp in the resource area for one day. After one day, it will set off to send Mr. Canghu to a new city. If the camp time exceeds, each day needs Add two more ingots of silver. If it exceeds two days, the convoy will automatically return to Huanglong Town and will no longer perform subsequent escort missions.</p>

    <p>Therefore, including the negotiated starting price of six ingots of silver, plus the deposit, Mr. Canghu needs to spend a total of 10 ingots of silver.</p>

    <p>In the end, he only had six pieces of silver left.</p>

    <p>And he needs to use the remaining six ingots of silver and the resources in the resource area to raise at least one million silver taels in a short period of time!</p>
