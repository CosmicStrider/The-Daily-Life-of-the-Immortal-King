  <h1>Chapter 2195 It doesn't matter. I will take action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi arrived with the Seven Star Team, Wang Ling and Sun Rong had already left. However, the octopus men present were still kneeling on the ground obediently, and no one dared to move even half a step.</p>

    <p>The strength of the immortal was so amazing. Long-range sniping was just a small operation with a raised hand. The octopus boss knew himself, so he decided to obey completely and no longer resist.</p>

    <p>In a secluded place not far from the incident, Zhuo Yi followed the scent of Wang Ling and met his cheap master alone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling handed a string of phone numbers to Zhuo Yi. Now we need to investigate the person behind this module formation and layout formation. This is the only clue.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi clasped his fists: "Master may see what this module formation is used for?"</p>

    <p>Modular arrays are usually composed of multiple modules. It is difficult to see what the specific array is until all are completed. Because some modules are universal modules and can also be applied to other arrays. Therefore, options are available It suddenly became more.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is still Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The deduction ability of King's Eyes is quite amazing. It can also deduce a specific magic circle using only one module.</p>

    <p>"Gathering Spirits into Formation." Wang Ling gave the conclusion.</p>

    <p>"Ju Ling Integration..." These four words made Zhuo Yi frown deeply.</p>

    <p>In his limited knowledge reserve system, he has rarely heard these four words. This is an ancient magic circle. It has an extremely wide range. It absorbs the underground spiritual veins within a specific range and the parts of the monks trapped by the formation. The magic circle of spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>Among them, the damage to underground spiritual veins is the greatest. The damage to monks will be relatively small. Even these monks who have had their spiritual energy drained will not be aware of the loss of their spiritual energy at all.</p>

    <p>But these spiritual energies will eventually flow into the hands of those who set up the formation.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's forehead began to sweat.</p>

    <p>Arrange such a modular array within Songhai City. Once it succeeds, the entire Songhai City will be destroyed overnight.</p>

    <p>Underground spiritual veins are irreparable natural resources...</p>

    <p>Of course, what makes Zhuo Yi feel a little nervous the most is the person behind the arrangement of the magic circle.</p>

    <p>If his master Wang Ling and his wife Sun Rong hadn't passed by together this time, I'm afraid the secret operation of arranging the modular array would have gone on smoothly and quietly.</p>

    <p>A magic circle can be deployed within the confines of Songhai City to conceal it from the outside world. The interest groups involved behind this are probably already entrenched in Songhai like old trees. They are complicated and complicated. There will definitely be obstacles to the investigation.</p>

    <p>"Master... I have a premonition that this matter is very dangerous."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Zuoyi said: "What I am most worried about now is whether the person behind this matter is related to the person in the restricted area."</p>

    <p>Honghuang. Qiao Yanyuan... This is the chess piece buried by Bai Zhe on the earth.</p>

    <p>Although Qiao Yanyuan did not succeed in the last operation to take away Wang Muyu, both Wang Ling and Zhuo Yi are very clear that they will definitely launch the next operation quickly.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling also got some clues in the battle where Qiao Yanyuan snatched Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>That was the clone that was directly abandoned by Qiao Yanyuan's main body.</p>

    <p>Now, the avatar is still being held in the top-level cell of Songhai City Number 1 Prison. It is reinforced by layers of seals and cannot escape.</p>

    <p>Just before Zhuo Yi arrived here, he was still preparing for interrogation-related matters. Unexpectedly, one wave of things happened after another.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling is here. There is nothing to be afraid of." Sun Rong encouraged Zhuo Yi and said, "No matter how dangerous it is, with Zhuo Yi's current comprehensive ability, we can handle it. It should be no problem, right? Even facing Bai Zhe..."</p>

    <p>"That's right."Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>He has the latest version of thermal underwear given by Wang Ling. Plus the already charged {Thirty-three Little Paths of Vitality}. Plus the second-ranked Spirit Sword Preliminary in the Sword King Realm. And various other Wang Ling A life-saving magic weapon given to him.</p>

    <p>Even if you encounter Bai Zhe and face a head-on confrontation, it is not a problem at all to use all the above methods and drag him to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yes. Just drag it to Wang Ling. All problems will be solved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Now Zhuo Yi is under a lot of pressure at work. What he lacks is not anything else but self-confidence.</p>

    <p>As a master, it is also necessary to properly encourage the disciples.</p>

    <p>So, he stretched out his hand and patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder: "Just check."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Master."Zhuo Yi straightened his expression and said, "But just in case..."</p>

    <p>"There is no such thing as a contingency."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling let go of his hand and put one hand behind his back. Like a general: "Nothing matters. I will take action."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Master!"</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's words, Zhuo Yi instantly felt his confidence surge up.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Another half hour later. After many twists and turns.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong finally arrived in the Southern Immortal District. A happy dream.</p>

    <p>This is the residence arranged by Wang Ling for Lao Huang. It is also the most suitable place for Lao Huang to live that Wang Ling found based on the stories Lao Huang told them in the game world.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's telepathy or a special fate. Wang Ling, Sun Rong had just scanned the green code and were about to enter the community. They saw a familiar figure at the door. He was wearing an antique-style ink robe. Jinfu. Walking from a distance carrying two bags full of paints and brushes.</p>

    <p>"It's you! Why are you here?" Lao Huang looked very excited and waved from a distance.</p>

    <p>His smile was brilliant. Snow-white teeth. Under the sun, old friends met. He stood not far away and was bathed in the light. The light illuminated the silk threads of his strong suit.</p>

    <p>Everything is so natural. Beautiful.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang's face. Everything about Lao Huang's appearance is the same as in the game world. It has never changed.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was breathing the air of the real world. He had become a native of this world. There was no sense of disobedience or mistakes.</p>

    <p>Thinking of the first time I met Lao Huang, Wang Ling could feel that Lao Huang had a different kind of demeanor. Wang Ling felt that I was destined to be with Lao Huang. There was a feeling of feeling like old friends at first sight.</p>

    <p>"I had a premonition that something good was going to happen this morning. I didn't expect to meet you here!"</p>

    <p>Lao Huang was very happy: "Are you passing by?"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Lao Huang. I was just too curious. So I investigated your home..." Sun Rong said as he touched his head.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. It's okay. The magic ring is currently under maintenance. I'm still worried about how to find you!" Lao Huang was extremely happy. Sun Rong's family background had already been revealed in the game world. A Huaguo Shuilian The eldest lady of the group can find out herself. This makes sense!</p>

    <p>Lao Huang had already regarded Wang Ling, Sun Rong as his friends, so he didn't even see anyone outside. He entered the community. He immediately invited the two of them and said, "Since you are here, then. Just come to my house and sit down! I just came back from going out. Prepare some exam supplies."</p>

    <p>He said while holding the brushes and various colors of paint in his hands.</p>

    <p>"Exam?"Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"It's an exam for a private enterprise... it can also be understood as an interview. They are looking for innovative cultivators." Lao Huang said.</p>
