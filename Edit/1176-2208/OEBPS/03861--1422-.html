  <h1>Chapter 1422 Heavenly Tomb</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The scale of this Sword Conference is unprecedented. Even the competition in the bronze group is also interesting.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming was surrounded and suppressed right after the opening ceremony. There were many cheers and cheers in the venue. However, what was unexpected was that when the smoke dissipated, the boy wearing rattan armor walked out unscathed.</p>

    <p>He was exuding a gleaming green light, exuding the aura of natural law. Leng Ming could not remember the memory of his special training. He only knew that during the special training he was beaten by his master and his wife. The sword body was shattered countless times and was broken again. Repair.</p>

    <p>It must be because of the special training...</p>

    <p>At this time, Leng Ming thought to himself.</p>

    <p>Because when the attacks from these Bronze Group players fall on him now, he doesn't feel any pain. It's like a mosquito bite.</p>

    <p>Since Leng Ming was under siege at the beginning, all the sword spirits launched an attack on Leng Ming. 199 sword energies gathered at one point to form a big explosion.</p>

    <p>Although Leng Ming doesn't feel any pain or itching.</p>

    <p>But this explosion has caused many sword spirits to be affected.</p>

    <p>More than half of the people were eliminated in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>So now, including Leng Ming, there are less than 100 sword spirits left on the field. And most of them are injured.</p>

    <p>The bronze group's sword energy exploded. The power was equally fierce.</p>

    <p>This is the terrifying thing about the sword spirits born in the Sword King Realm. Even the sword spirits in the bronze group can still accomplish great things if they go to the earth.</p>

    <p>After the first round of testing, it was clear to everyone at the scene that the final opponent this little grass faced was the Ice and Fire Brothers in the void.</p>

    <p>These two brothers have very strong fighting power. If they join forces, they will be able to fight against the sword spirits of the Silver Group.</p>

    <p>Twin sword spirits are very rare in the Sword King Realm. The Ice and Fire Brothers have not been conceived in the Sword King Realm for too long. In time, they might be able to rank in the Diamond Group.</p>

    <p>"A piece of grass. It's so hard? But that's it. It was just a test..." In the void, the pair of ice and fire brothers held their arms and stared down at Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>The two brothers had already arrived before the match started. Leng Ming might have received special training from the Sword King, so he would not be defeated so easily.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this was exactly what the two brothers wanted.</p>

    <p>It would be boring if it was knocked down too easily.</p>

    <p>The current Leng Ming was personally trained by Lord Sword King.</p>

    <p>If they can defeat Leng Ming in such a situation, the two brothers will surely become famous in one fell swoop through this battle!</p>

    <p>Maybe he will be favored and appreciated by the Sword King,</p>

    <p>At this time, Leng Ming looked into the void. The pressure from the Ice and Fire Brothers was not as great as he had imagined.</p>

    <p>The pressure on him actually comes more from Wang Ling, Jingke and Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming knew very well that these three people were also watching his battle.</p>

    <p>Because of this. He doesn't want to be embarrassed.</p>

    <p>As soon as the thought came to mind, the injured sword spirits nearby who had not been eliminated suddenly rose into the sky again.</p>

    <p>They understood each other tacitly and actually formed a sword formation on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Tianyang Sword Formation! Kill him first!" someone shouted.</p>

    <p>They formed a circle in the sky. They radiated light like the sun.</p>

    <p>In the center of the Tianyang Sword Formation, the sword energy is intertwined and continuously fused, and then a combined sword energy is generated, surging with powerful energy.</p>

    <p>It only takes a few seconds.</p>

    <p>There was a beam of golden light, like a giant sword falling from the sky. It fell from above the head and hit Leng Ming's face.</p>

    <p>This combined sword energy is very strong. If Leng Ming had not undergone special training, he would probably collapse on the spot.</p>

    <p>But now. Things are different now.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's vine armor was covered in smoke when illuminated by the combined sword energy.</p>

    <p>"Don't get in the way."</p>

    <p>Leng Ming didn't even bother to raise his head.</p>

    <p>He didn't care. With a flick, a trace of emerald green sword energy flowed out from his fingers.</p>

    <p>This trace of emerald-green sword energy was very calm, without any murderous intent. However, just as the combined sword energy submerged into the air, a big explosion suddenly occurred.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the mushroom cloud rising from mid-air, the sword spirits that formed the sword formation were instantly blown to pieces. They were flying around the entire sword fighting arena like vibrating eggs.</p>

    <p>After getting rid of these sword spirits, Leng Ming began to face the two opponents in front of him seriously.</p>

    <p>The ice and fire brothers were also observing the battle situation. They were surprised at the results of Leng Ming's special training.</p>

    <p>This increase in combat power is indeed too rapid.</p>

    <p>"Brother..." At this time, Bing jian turned his attention to Huo Ren beside him.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we have to destroy him."</p>

    <p>Huo Jian's inner thoughts coincided with Bing Jian's.</p>

    <p>They wanted to win Jingke's favor through this battle. But Leng Ming's rapid promotion made them feel a pressure.</p>

    <p>Even if they beat Leng Ming, Leng Ming's talent is still here. As long as the talent is still there, it is only a matter of time before he surpasses them.</p>

    <p>But now if the child in front of him is destroyed in the conference, then the Sword King may have no choice.</p>

    <p>At the judging table, in the crystal room, Yu Ling frowned lightly. She could feel that the ice and fire brothers were already accumulating strength.</p>

    <p>And...</p>

    <p>"There is a strong murderous intention. It seems that these brothers have murderous intentions towards Leng Ming." It's not just Yu Ling. Mo Yu also felt it.</p>

    <p>"The Sword King is also watching this duel. This move is to attract the Sword King's attention." Jiu You said.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that he is worthy of being the custodian of the Sword King Realm. He immediately understood the inner thoughts of the two brothers.</p>

    <p>"These two brothers seem to have a certain combination of skills. What is it called?" At this time, Mo Yu lowered his head and thought.</p>

    <p>"It's a sword of ice and fire." Xiao Qian replied: "With the sword energy in the whole body condensed, it collides with the opponent left and right at a high speed. One person uses the left leg, and the other uses the right leg. The two legs fly and attack. Then use The force of his legs crushed his head."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Can the little one handle it?" Mo Yu was worried. The jade crown on her head changed color at the same time, turning into a melancholy dark blue.</p>

    <p>This color-changing jade crown can reflect Mo Yu's current mood. If there is no fluctuation, it will be white.</p>

    <p>"I don't think you need to worry too much." Jiu You smiled.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what the two-day special training was about.</p>

    <p>However, judging from Leng Ming's reaction to the Tianyang Sword Formation just now, I am afraid that in the past two days, Jingke and Bai Qiao were in mixed doubles mode. I am afraid that all the combination skills have been used by Leng Ming. It was shown before my eyes.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the two brothers of Ice and Fire's combined skill {Ice and Fire Sword} has already struck.</p>

    <p>He expected that the next attack from the Ice and Fire Brothers would definitely form a concentrated fire attack on him.</p>

    <p>Although Leng Ming couldn't remember this scene, he felt as if he had seen it somewhere.</p>

    <p>His body reacted almost uncontrollably with muscle memory.</p>

    <p>When the two brothers' ice legs and hams were close to his head, one hand grabbed one side and pinched their ankles.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's figure is light and light, forming a spiral on the spot, like a dance, playing with the two brothers of ice and fire.</p>

    <p>It was a force that used softness to overcome hardness. After spinning for a few seconds, it threw the Ice and Fire Brothers flying.</p>

    <p>When everyone came to their senses, a Tai Chi disc formed under Leng Ming's feet.</p>

    <p>This is a technique that uses the strength of the two brothers to use force. Leng Ming didn't know how he started it. His body started to move involuntarily.</p>

    <p>When the counterattack was completed, the two Ice and Fire brothers were seen hugging each other in the sword fighting arena, their clothes in rags and their faces bruised and swollen.</p>

    <p>There was fear in their eyes. They kicked their legs and kept retreating. They also muttered in panic: "Who...who does Tai Chi..."</p>

    <p>The entire sword fighting arena was silent for a few seconds, and then burst into fiery cheers!</p>

    <p>Audiences have always been passive. This is true.</p>

    <p>And this is the scary thing about champion fans.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming breathed a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>I feel that I have not embarrassed my master.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the depths of the infinite galaxy. This is a layer beyond the extraterrestrial galaxy.</p>

    <p>Through the endless stars, a pair of evil eyes filled with turbidity opened at this time: "I found...the most suitable sacrifice..."</p>

    <p>"My lord, finally you can't hold it any longer?" A young voice sounded after a moment.</p>

    <p>This voice came from a young man surrounded by stars. His figure was blurry. Only a faint outline wrapped in starlight could be seen.</p>

    <p>While speaking, the surrounding planets collided and then exploded.</p>

    <p>The two of them used the universe as a chessboard and used the planets in their hands as chess pieces to play.</p>

    <p>"Transformed by the Tomb Grass. I have been waiting for a long time...for it to take shape. But now, the time is about to mature."</p>

    <p>The owner of the Muddy Eyes said calmly: "When the old Rubik's Cube is assembled, it will be the day when those people die...people will always have to pay the price for their ignorance..."</p>

    <p>"But that young man is difficult to deal with. Even I can't see where he came from." The young man surrounded by stars frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"I will fully understand him before the war. I have already laid out my chess pieces in the Sword King Realm."</p>

    <p>At this time, the owner of the Muddy Eyes said in a cold voice.</p>
