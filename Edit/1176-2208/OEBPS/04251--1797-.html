  <h1>Chapter 1797 The behind-the-scenes storm hidden in Glio City</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After bidding farewell to Mrs. Lawen, everyone successfully met Jiugong Liangzi at the Starry Sky Tower.</p>

    <p>While watching the scenery at the Starry Sky Tower, Wang Ling saw Jiugong Liangzi secretly find an opportunity to put the Gray Cult leader's token into Sun Rong's hand. Then the two started talking.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "I think this Mrs. Lawen has a secret. She is also a businessman. Walwolf's business network covers the entire Mixiu Country. It generates tens of billions of revenue every year. Just to give it to you for a variety show? This It's too unrealistic."</p>

    <p>"I... feel the same way." Sun Rong nodded: "Originally I didn't want to take this. But now the principal has agreed. He said that this is an action that brings glory to the country. And he also said."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was confused: "What else can he say?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said dumbfounded: "He also said that this was the result of his comprehensive consideration, because starting from our class, all competitions with classmates Wang Ling have won. So Principal Chen felt that Wang Ling is a mascot. So this is a sure win."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi sighed.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Wang Ling is a very dangerous mascot...</p>

    <p>This time, various forces are mixed together. Jiugong Liangzi feels that what is going to happen next may become interesting.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi, where are you going to live next? Is safety guaranteed?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I have no problem. Seniors Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi followed me. And they also got free hotel coupons on the plane. We are now staying at a resort hotel on the edge of Glio City. The location of that place is excellent. The control range of any force is a blind spot."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "If we settle down here, we can intervene from the outside to support you at any time."</p>

    <p>"As expected of senior Qin Zhong."Sun Rong sighed.</p>

    <p>"Worry about yourself more than me."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "There is obviously a problem with this variety show challenge. Although it is not sure what the purpose of Mrs. Lawen is yet. But you have to be careful. There is currently a conflict between Chilan Club and the Army. But there is no result yet."</p>

    <p>"After all, this operation was authorized by the church. I'm afraid the church has negotiated with Maiko Assi." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"I don't think it's that simple."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "As far as I know, according to the forces of Mixiu Country, when the church, the military and local forces have disputes, there is actually a peacemaking organization that overrides the three. It is affiliated to the Mixiu Country Cultivation Federation. Sent by Bian. I remember what it was called... Heavenly Dao Alliance?"</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao alliance?"</p>

    <p>"The Heavenly Dao Alliance does not belong to any city. It is a force directly under the Mixiu Country Head of State. Just for the sake of the Head of State, these forces have to give some face. Originally, we aroused conflicts between the two sides, but it was still very successful. If the Heavenly Dao Alliance intervenes at this time to mediate the conflict, even if they share the same hatred, they will point the finger at us."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi rubbed her eyebrows and felt an unprecedented headache: "Now, Senior Xiang Yi has prepared for the worst."</p>

    <p>"He doesn't mean to..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. He has already extracted the three parties, so the photo of the leader of the forces, if the last really can not handle. He'll just have to be the bad guy."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "At that time, whether it is the Pope of the Church or the leader of the Heavenly Dao Alliance, this silver bullet from Senior Xiang is enough to blow the head of any of them..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, the Volute Hotel where everyone from Number 60 High School was placed was under martial law inside and outside. The person responsible for the martial law was not sent by the Huaguo Shuilian Group, nor was it a local mercenary group. Instead, he belonged to Mrs. Lawen. The direct troops of the affiliated force.</p>

    <p>They are white warriors called "White Demons." They are all equipped with light armor. Each of them carries at least two samurai swords. The average realm is at the sixth level of Soul Formation!</p>

    <p>These white warriors are like hailstones after spring thunder.</p>

    <p>Densely packed from all directions, the Volute hotel is surrounded by water, every guest staying at the Volute hotel has to be closely screened for identity before being allowed to stay. "Too exaggerated..." Outside the hotel suite, Chen Chao and the others looked at the scene outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, and even though they were on the upper floors, they could clearly feel the busy figures of the white knights on the ground below, a few dozen meters away.</p>

    <p>"Whatever. Anyway, we have been targeted by the local forces now. Mrs. Lawen did that to protect us." Guo Hao spread his hands and said, "Anyway, didn't she also make a promise to the Sun Rong boss?. The hotel's financial losses due to the White Warrior's protection issues will be paid three times as compensation."</p>

    <p>Having said that.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong still feels vaguely uneasy.</p>

    <p>The purpose of Mrs. Lawen's doing this seems to be to protect them from successfully recording the upcoming variety show challenge, and to make various security arrangements.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong had an intuition deep down. She felt that the real purpose behind Mrs. Lawen was not that simple. Especially after Jiugong Liangzi said those words to her, she even felt that Mrs. Lawen's purpose was not that simple.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, under the night, in front of St. Peter's Cathedral, Mrs. Lawen slowly walked out of a limousine.</p>

    <p>"I'll escort the lady in." Behind her, two white warriors came in an instant and appeared behind her.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to go in. Wait for me at the door." Mrs. Lawen's expression was calm. She moved her slightly blessed body and held a snow-white cane along the red carpet laid to the soles of her feet in front of St. Peter's Cathedral. Slowly Walk along the inside of the church.</p>

    <p>The glazed tiles on the dome are shrouded in moonlight. They are noble and gorgeous, giving people a solemn and holy feeling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, in St. Peter's Cathedral, the figure of Levis, the president of the Chilan Society, has already appeared here in advance. He is facing the portrait of the Virgin and is sitting on a wooden bench with half his buttocks. He is praying devoutly.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he heard the noise that he slowly opened his eyes and muttered: "Lawen, you're here. And you didn't bring a guard. You're still as courageous as ever. You deserve to be called the Snow Queen of Glio City."</p>

    <p>"It's all a false name given by others. It's okay not to mention it."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen covered her mouth and squinted her eyes with a smile: "You, the Red Eagle of the Chilan Society, are not bad either. You were not frightened by the legendary general Maiko Assi. You just stayed in your cave and didn't dare to come out."</p>

    <p>"I'm just curious. Why does a person who openly chooses to take sides have the courage to stand here." Levis laughed.</p>

    <p>"Take sides? What sides?" Mrs. Lawen pretended to be puzzled.</p>

    <p>"You openly mobilized white warriors to protect those despicable foreigners. On the surface, it was to ensure the recording of the variety show challenge. But in fact, this is not an act of siding with others."</p>

    <p>At this time, Levi showed a sinister smile: "Do you think the church will let you go so easily?</p>
