  <h1>Chapter 1734 The synthetic dragon man</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To Wang Ming's surprise. Sun Rong's expression seemed to be particularly calm. The attitude on his face was unmistakable. Not only did he not turn into a steam girl, but he seemed to have a hidden smile.</p>

    <p>Is it because you have become numb after being teased too many times?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming secretly thought that he had made a mistake. He felt that he did use too much force and failed to control the rhythm of teasing someone.</p>

    <p>"I noticed that you have become calmer. Rongrong." Wang Ming couldn't help laughing. He looked at Sun Rong and said.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, you guys have made fun of me so many times. I can always get used to it." Sun Rong sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Then it seems I have to arrange a bigger surprise to scare you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. The look on his face was very similar to the way Zhuo Yi smiled "hehehe": "Speaking of which, my laboratory has developed lotus root baby care products. Do you want to try it too?"</p>

    <p>"Lian... lotus root person?"</p>

    <p>"It is an experimental product developed for parents who are pregnant or are still planning to have a baby. It allows them to experience the life of raising a baby in advance."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Use the bodies created by Immortal Lotus. Then use big data analysis to analyze the personalities of both men and women. Finally, a virtual personality is formed and injected into the bodies of Immortal Lotus dolls. So, do you want to get one too?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this. She took a breath of air: "I don't want to!"</p>

    <p>She refused outright.</p>

    <p>I can't imagine what it would be like if there really was such an immortal lotus root doll... And the virtual personality of this immortal lotus root doll must be created by two people.</p>

    <p>Who did she...create with?</p>

    <p>Her and Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, thinking of this, she suddenly felt that she had been tricked again.</p>

    <p>She glared at Wang Ming, deliberately showing anger for the first time: "Brother Ming... stop joking. I will really be angry. We are on a mission now!"</p>

    <p>"Okay. I went a little too far. I apologize." Wang Ming raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. He had a playful smile on his face. It didn't look like he was apologizing at all.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed. Decided not to argue with Wang Ming anymore.</p>

    <p>At this time, the two people went deep into the laboratory and found that many researchers in the laboratory maintained the same posture and expression, like frozen wax figures, motionless.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with them?" Sun Rong walked up to a researcher in a white coat. She poked the man's face gently.</p>

    <p>"Well, I used brain waves to cover the entire laboratory and freeze their actions." Wang Ming said: "It's similar to a kind of mental suppression? I don't know how to explain it."</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, can you still do this now?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It was definitely not possible before. But now that I have my body back, I feel like I can do a lot of things that I couldn't do before."</p>

    <p>"Because of the divine brain?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe." Wang Ming said: "Hahaha! After all, this is something from the Eternal One. I feel like I picked something up for nothing this time. And this thing can help enlighten my thinking. Maybe it can help me succeed. Research a new Talisman."</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ming does have a different feeling than before. The blessing of the divine brain is equivalent to implanting another motherboard into his brain, allowing him to perform higher-density data calculations directly in his mind. Now it's not an exaggeration to call it a humanoid self-propelled calculator.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming. Where are we going now?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>She knew that if Wang Ming had used brain waves to freeze the researchers in the entire laboratory, then he must have figured out the entire map of this heaven-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>"Go this way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. Then he gave Sun Rong directions. He directly used brain waves to synchronize the map in Sun Rong's mind and marked their current coordinates.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong rode a motorcycle through the laboratory along the map that Wang Ming synchronized in his mind.</p>

    <p>Soon they arrived at a confidential location. This was a place sealed by a three-layer smart door and a magic circle. It was an important place for storing dragon bones. "Aohai." Seeing this, Sun Rong called out softly. Then Wang Ming saw a sword energy missile transformed by Aohai fired from the back of the motorcycle. It directly penetrated a huge hole in the triple door.</p>

    <p>How can it still be like this?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>He felt that Sun Rong was becoming more and more able to control Aohai.</p>

    <p>After entering the laboratory, a huge oval eggshell-shaped crystal container immediately caught the eyes of Wang Ming and Sun Rong. There were hundreds of tubes connected to the outside of the egg-shaped container. The experiments were carried out respectively. Crystal display wall in room interior.</p>

    <p>"This is..." At this time, Sun Rong's pupils shrank slightly. She was shocked by the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>Because just behind these display walls are keels of different parts!</p>

    <p>"The Dark Devouring Dragon, Cangyuan Dragon and some of the Moonlight Dragon's keel bones. As well as the keel bones of the other dragon clans... seem to be here." Wang Ming's eyes narrowed. The expression on his face quickly became serious.</p>

    <p>He and Sun Rong quickly got out of the car and came to the egg-shaped container. There was only one researcher in this huge laboratory. He was also frozen. He also held a password card. He seemed to be planning to use it. What program does the password card activate?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stepped forward and took off the password card. He swiped it directly on the instrument in front of him.</p>

    <p>Soon. Sun Rong saw a line of words appear on the screen.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a step forward, frowned, and continued to read: "What does your favorite person look like? What does this mean, Brother Ming? Is it a password?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe." Wang Ming nodded and said with a smile: "Haha. People engaged in research work are under great pressure. They often add their own bad taste in this kind of password setting process. This is similar to what I saw in a foreign country before. The news about doctors is the same. It is said that a foreign doctor carved the letters "S" and "B" on his patient's liver when he was operating on his patient because he was under great pressure."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong saw Wang Ming put his hand on the researcher's head: "It's okay. Let me see. What is the password in his mind..."</p>

    <p>But what is very strange is that Wang Ming has just put his hand on it when the electronic screen in front of him suddenly jumps: "Mind reading completed. The facial features data of the person you like has been successfully read."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ming was shocked at the same time.</p>

    <p>God knows this isn't a password at all. It's a mind-reading question...</p>

    <p>What shocked Sun Rong and Wang Ming even more.</p>

    <p>After this electronic sound, all the conduits connected to the keel in the entire laboratory burst out with bright light at the same time. A stream of energy was absorbed along the conduits by the egg-shaped container in front of you. All of it was injected into the egg-shaped container.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>An astonishing psychic energy appears!</p>

    <p>A powerful shock wave erupted from the egg-shaped container. Then cracks gradually appeared on the egg-shaped container.</p>

    <p>"This...Brother Ming...what is this..." Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>Because right in front of the egg-shaped container, a six-year-old child appeared. And he looked like Wang Ling... Although it was just a child-like face. But when Sun Rong looked at it, that's what Wang Ling looked like when he was a child!</p>

    <p>That question just now. What was read was what Sun Rong was thinking in her heart.</p>

    <p>The bright light flickered for a long time. The child who looked almost the same as Wang Ling and was full of dragon aura finally opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>His facial features were so similar to Wang Ling that Sun Rong was in a trance for a while. The only difference was the two seven-color glazed dragon horns on the top of his head and the smart seven-colored glazed dragon on his tailbone.</p>

    <p>Immediately, something surprising happened to Sun Rong and Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>I saw that the child in front of me opened her eyes and looked at Sun Rong. She made a soft and pitiful voice: "Mom..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "???"</p>
