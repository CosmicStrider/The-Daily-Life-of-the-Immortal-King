  <h1>Chapter 1185 You were fooled!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is the point of inquiry. Everything has come to light.</p>

    <p>With Mother Wang's character, she would never engage in deception. So there must be someone pretending to be the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. But who is this person and what does she look like? Only Jiang Yingyue knows all this.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't expect that after they took on the "main mission" of Little Master Lingzi to annihilate the people behind the scenes, they unintentionally took on a new side mission: to find the liar who had been claiming to be the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother and pretending to be his identity. </p>

    <p>This matter is related to Mother Wang's reputation. And judging from the behavior of this impostor so far, the other party seems to have a certain understanding of Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>If the other party decides to retire in the end and transfer all the "sins" to Mother Wang, Mother Wang will definitely be in trouble for death if she is in the body-refining stage without the power to restrain the chicken.</p>

    <p>So to sum up, Er Ha feels that Jiang Yingyue cannot die...at least until the person pretending to be Mother Wang is found. Jiang Yingyue's knowledge of the impostor is probably the best clue at his fingertips!</p>

    <p>"Your eyes seem to want to fight back? But you have no chance." Jiang Yingyue stared at Er Ha. Her shadow bomb has entered the final countdown stage.</p>

    <p>It will explode as soon as the last 10 seconds pass.</p>

    <p>Use the low-level assassination spell of Wind and Thunder Nine Kills to confuse your vision. In fact, you use this short-term lightning to quickly adjust the position and layout of the shadow, and then install the bomb.</p>

    <p>This kind of attack that combines reality and reality is one of the highest realms of combat. Such combat strategies are often not performed on the spot. Instead, they are a level that can only be reached after a long period of experience.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Er Ha let out a cold laugh: "Your combat level is indeed very high. Without the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of combat experiences, it is indeed difficult to reach this point. But I want to say that the battle strategy is of course Important. Being able to predict the enemy's next move is even more important."</p>

    <p>"You have 3 seconds left..." Jiang Yingyue sighed inwardly. She didn't expect that the green-haired dog in front of her was still in the mood to explain at this time.</p>

    <p>Is this to fulfill the law of immortality in combat?</p>

    <p>She was counting down in her mind. It was as if she could already see the green-haired dog being blown to pieces by the bomb. The shadow bomb only blew up the shadow. It would not cause any damage to the surrounding environment. However, once the shadow shattered. The body will immediately fall apart.</p>

    <p>This is the terrifying thing about her shadow bomb.</p>

    <p>A person's life can be taken away silently!</p>

    <p>Three...two...one...</p>

    <p>The countdown ended. Jiang Yingyue turned his back. A real master will never face an explosion head-on.</p>

    <p>However, she took a few steps and realized that something was wrong... the familiar sound of explosions did not come. The green-haired dog that turned into a human and his companions were also alive and well. They were not blown up as imagined. The pile of torn pieces of meat.</p>

    <p>"Impossible!" Jiang Yingyue turned around. Only then did she realize that she had fallen into a trap!</p>

    <p>Er Ha, who was originally in human form, suddenly transformed into a dog form at some point. Like a green lightning bolt, it quickly aimed at her behind and attacked.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue still didn't know what happened. She only saw a huge demon king appearing behind Er Ha. Then she immediately felt that her eyes went dark! Suddenly she couldn't see anything!</p>

    <p>This is the Tuntian Ha tribe's ancestral {Inhalation Technique}. It can swallow everything into the space in the mouth! Shadow bombs are suddenly scary. Bombs can be placed in the shadow. But if it is in an absolutely dark and sealed space, there will be no shadow. When it appears, the ability of the shadow bomb is almost like a decoration.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue was swallowed into the space. She struggled in the darkness. The space was bigger than she imagined. When she shouted, there was no echo.</p>

    <p>"Useless junior...entered my space. Do you still want to escape?" Er Ha sneered. Its dog-form swallowing technique has long been re-strengthened and learned by Little Master Ling. Now this swallowing technique space is extremely It is wide and surrounded by impregnable water. Once a realm like Jiang Yingyue is imprisoned in it, there is absolutely no way to break it.</p>

    <p>The only thing that needs to be paid attention to is that Er Ha must ensure that no light can penetrate into the internal space, giving Jiang Yingyue a chance to use any shadow bomb.</p>

    <p>It has long been known that with a conceited personality like Jiang Yingyue, he would never stare at the bomb explosion when it explodes... Many masters have the habit of looking back without looking at the explosion.</p>

    <p>So, this allowed Er Ha to seize the opportunity in an instant. He directly found the opportunity and pounced on Jiang Yingyue, turning the situation around and turning it into a victory.</p>

    <p>"You are not a simple dog..." Jiang Yingyue was trapped in the space. After struggling and finding that she could not escape, she gave up the resistance. Instead, she planned to save her strength and look for opportunities again.</p>

    <p>"After all, this king is also transformed into a demon king of the demon clan. Now he has done good deeds and received guidance. He is even stronger than before."</p>

    <p>"Demon King..." Jiang Yingyue was shocked. To be honest, the aura on Er Ha's body was so clean! She didn't feel the demon king's demonic aura on Er Ha at all.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she felt as if she had been swallowed into an artificial black hole. It was so dark that there was no light at all. The light effect caused by the spell would be completely absorbed by this space immediately. The error during the period was no more than a few seconds. Microseconds...such a time. Jiang Yingyue would not be able to arrange a bomb to blow up this space no matter what.</p>

    <p>"I have another question." Although the temporary failure was declared, Jiang Yingyue was still unconvinced: "How...how did you avoid my shadow bomb?"</p>

    <p>"Junior, you suddenly have a good idea. But you don't seem to have discovered the fatal flaw of the shadow bomb." Er Ha replied patiently.</p>

    <p>"Fatal flaw?"</p>

    <p>"You can turn the shadow you touch into a bomb. However, such a bomb has limitations... If the shadow changes during the period, your bomb will be ineffective." Er Ha said: "What you touched is My human-shaped shadow. And after I turned into a dog, my shadow immediately became different. Your shadow bomb also became ineffective. That's why it didn't cause any harm to me. There was no imaginary explosion."</p>

    <p>"Reset..." Jiang Yingyue didn't expect such a thing to happen.</p>

    <p>"That's right! You... were fooled!"</p>

    <p>"But how did you know about this?" Jiang Yingyue felt incredible.</p>

    <p>"Sometimes fighting strategy is important. However, any strategy is ineffective against gamblers... I bet that your bomb will be ineffective against me after I change my shadow! Therefore, this battle is my victory. !" Er Ha smiled confidently.</p>
