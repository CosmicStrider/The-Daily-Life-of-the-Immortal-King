  <h1>Chapter 1389 Sun Rong Killing God</h1>

  <div>



<p>The situation happened very suddenly. A piece of Old God's head was directly cut off by Sun Rong, forming a physical version of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Moreover, Aohai also had a bad intention. She covered her sword energy with the "Power of the Dead Sea."</p>

<p>This is originally an ability similar to the "serious injury effect." It can block recovery.</p>

<p>But now, using the sword energy to cut off Old God's scalp, it can make Old God unable to recover his hair in a short period of time.</p>

<p>He can only fight Sun Rong naked.</p>

<p>He watched helplessly as a piece of his hair fell off. Old God was trembling with anger.</p>

<p>The mountain-like body shook violently in the core world, causing the whole world to rumble.</p>

<p>"Kill you..."</p>

<p>Offending Shenyan. This is naturally a very terrible thing.</p>

<p>The Old God condensed her body. The expression on her face became serious. She rushed towards Sun Rong with the Ten Thousand Winged God ring on her head. Her divine power was unparalleled!</p>

<p>Old God spreads his golden wings. He exudes powerful divine power.</p>

<p>"How come it's not ten thousand wings?" Er Ha was suprised.</p>

<p>"It's integrated into one. If we directly open the wings, the wings will be like sails. The air resistance is too great. Even the Old God may not be able to fly." Wang Ying replied.</p>

<p>This answer was too scientific. Er Ha was unable to refute it.</p>

<p>At this time, the Old God, who had his scalp cut off, was extremely angry.</p>

<p>When the golden wings fluttered, stars appeared in the sky. Huge meteorites kept falling.</p>

<p>Sun Rong holds Aohai. The boundless sword energy of the sea is rampant. It smashes these falling meteorites one by one.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make you realize reality. You can never go against God."</p>

<p>The next moment, the divine light exploded from Old God's red clothes. The starlight gathered from under her feet. Along with the endless floating golden divine feathers, it turned into a star carpet and was laid out under her feet.</p>

<p>This is a supernatural power. Indeed, only God can do it.</p>

<p>She walked on the red carpet without speaking. But a divine light emerged in her pupils, and there were powerful fluctuations building up inside.</p>

<p>"You will... perish in this galaxy."</p>

<p>The next moment, Old God raised his hand. She turned her hand over. The star carpet under her feet instantly turned upside down. Countless stars poured down.</p>

<p>In just a short moment, the entire core world was rained with meteorites. Hundreds of stars emerged. They were densely packed and fell like hailstones.</p>

<p>"He turned the divine feather into a meteorite!" Er Ha's eyes were horrified.</p>

<p>This change is not a cover-up. It is a real change!</p>

<p>God's will can theoretically change everything.</p>

<p>God is almost omnipotent!</p>

<p>Sun Rong looked solemn. She jumped onto a meteorite and used Aohai's sword energy to block it.</p>

<p>But the density of these meteorites is too high. Now we have reached a situation where we have to use ultimate moves to clear the field!</p>

<p>"Alluring Sword!" Sun Rong pointed to the sky. Directly using his strongest swordsmanship!</p>

<p>A sword energy of tens of thousands of meters was formed instantly under the stunned gaze of the Old God.</p>

<p>The rolling sword intent of the angry sea, mixed with the tsunami echo of Heavenly Dao's Hong Zhong, made the light of the entire core world even more dazzling!</p>

<p>Aohai's figure skyrocketed. She was like a giantess.</p>

<p>The power accumulated by tens of thousands of clones made Aohai's sword energy truly turn into a vast sea, and rush against the incoming galaxies!</p>

<p>"MD. This is actually a battle during the Foundation Building period!" Er Ha was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Before, in the secret cultivation realm of the Mountain of Recall, it was pressed underground the whole time. It almost became a dog meat. It had no idea what was going on outside.</p>

<p>Now that I have seen this scene with my own eyes, its dog's mouth felt as if it was dislocated. It could not be closed.</p>

<p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p>

<p>The powerful Alluring Sword charged against the stars with the overwhelming power of the sea. It swallowed up all the falling stars and then shattered them into pieces in the sea.</p>

<p>At this time, Old God looked down with a complicated expression.</p>

<p>A Foundation Building period. It has the ability to resist the power of God... This is undoubtedly a provocation!</p>

<p>But the Old God also clearly sensed the real fighting power in Sun Rong. This move "Alluring Sword" scared her. It actually made her mind fluctuate.</p>

<p>The sword energy of tens of thousands of meters almost cut the galaxy she had thrown out in half with a crushing force, neutralizing all her divine power.</p>

<p>Old God waved his golden wings and quickly retreated. She crossed her arms and blocked the front. The ten thousand meters of sword energy hit the position where her arms were crossed. One sword drew Old God to the end of the core world and hit him. On the wall of nothingness.</p>

<p>This sword is so terrifying.</p>

<p>It almost poked a hole in the core world. It also took her, the owner of the core world, out of the core world...</p>

<p>But Old God is Old God.</p>

<p>Her combat experience is far beyond that of Sun Rong.</p>

<p>To be able to unleash such a powerful sword in one Foundation Building period, he must have accumulated strength in his spare time.</p>

<p>Therefore, she expected that Sun Rong would not be able to perform such a powerful killing blow continuously.</p>

<p>And in fact, it is indeed the case.</p>

<p>Alluring Sword takes 12 hours to charge...</p>

<p>Sun Rong can store up to 10 swords. However, there is not much time between the last use.</p>

<p>"I'm curious. How many more sword cuts can you make?" Old God smiled. She knew her chance had come.</p>

<p>"Rongrong! Back up! This woman is going to go big!"</p>

<p>Sun Ying'er realized that the situation was not good and hurriedly pulled Sun Rong back.</p>

<p>She felt murderous intent from the Old God's eyes. She felt that the situation was not good. She immediately sprinted ten thousand meters with Sun Rong in her arms. She even used the method of shrinking to an inch. She wanted to keep a distance from the Old God.</p>

<p>"Want to leave?"</p>

<p>Old God shook his head slightly.</p>

<p>This is her core world. No one can escape.</p>

<p>It was just a twitch of the fingers.</p>

<p>Sun Ying'er, who had slipped far away before, was returned not far from Old God.</p>

<p>In the core world. The master of the core world can limit the combat range. No one can escape.</p>

<p>"Give this thing to them." At this time, Wang Ying finally decided to take action.</p>

<p>But it's not really about taking action. It's about giving some assistance with props.</p>

<p>He huddled in Er Ha's shadow. He stretched out his hand and placed something in Er Ha's dog's mouth.</p>

<p>"This is..." Er Ha was startled.</p>

<p>"The power bank enlightened by the Lord." Wang Ying replied.</p>

<p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

<p>The situation was too urgent. Er Ha had no time to think too much. Its tongue rolled around the power bank. It instantly stretched it in the direction of Sun Rong: "Sun Rong Girl, please lend it! This is the charger given to you by the Lord. Treasure!"</p>

<p>"Charge... power bank?" Sun Rong thought he heard wrong.</p>

<p>As a result, a power bank was delivered to her.</p>

<p>Following Er Ha's prompts, Sun Rong successfully found the charging port located on the hilt of the Aohai sword... This is a TYPE C interface!</p>

<p>This existed before after upgrading Aohai.</p>

<p>The monk didn't say anything. Even Sun Rong himself didn't find out.</p>

<p>Because the location is very hidden.</p>

<p>Moreover, who knows there is a charging port on the hilt of the sword!</p>

<p>"How much sword energy can a mere power bank replenish for you?" Old God laughed again.</p>

<p>Sun Rong Connect the power bank.</p>

<p>The next moment, she felt Aohai's sword energy filling up rapidly at a terrifying speed!</p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>Sun Rong raised his sword again and swung it towards Old God!</p>

<p>Alluring Sword!</p>

<p>A Sword in the City!</p>
    
<p>Or... One Sword<sup>1</sup>!</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(Alternate translations of "Alluring Sword")</dfn>

<p>At this time, Aohai, who felt that the power in his body was gradually filling up, turned his gaze to Sun Rong. He asked gently: "Sword Master, this is too troublesome. Do you need to fire all ten swords at once?"</p>

<p>Sun Rong covered her mouth and looked surprised: "Classmate Wang Ling's power bank. Can it replenish so many swords..."</p>

<p>"It is indeed possible." Aohai nodded: "But now the space of the sword spirit is limited. It can only fire ten swords at a time. If calculated according to the total energy provided by this power bank, it can provide a total of ten thousand sword spirits."</p>

<p>"?" After hearing this, Old God was so shocked that his feathers exploded.</p>

<p>What the hell. Is this a nuclear power bank???</p></div>
