  <h1>Chapter 1730 Bone grabbing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had not imagined what Bai Zhe's ultimate goal would be after going in such a big circle before. He had many answers in his mind. But he felt that the lowest possible answer was that Bai Zhe was trying to use the checks and balances mechanism of the universe.</p>

    <p>Does anyone really think it's useful to "complain" to the universe about him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that no one should be that stupid. But this time, I still gained some knowledge.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming regained his body sovereignty and knew and analyzed Master Wu Xin's memory, these inferences can now be said to be almost solid.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly remembered the time when he went to watch a movie and TV show. The official in ancient uniform was sitting in the courtroom. He was shocked and yelled: "Who in this hall dares to sue me?"</p>

    <p>They say that material comes from life. Wang Ling never thought that one day, this would happen to me.</p>

    <p>Now, the mother body of the Thought Plague has been eliminated. After the source of the mother body is cut off, new Thought Plague will no longer be produced. And those that have invaded the human body will gradually wither away because they cannot sense the mother body.</p>

    <p>This is a big game. Wang Ling can be regarded as a comeback. But obviously it is not time to relax yet.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. What should we do now?" Sun Rong asked. She saw the serious thinking on the young man's face. She desperately hoped that she could be of help.</p>

    <p>I express myself like this. I also want to get closer to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sometimes she felt that she was very close to Wang Ling. When she thought she was about to succeed, suddenly the distance began to become far away again.</p>

    <p>So now Sun Rong feels that what Sun Ying'er said to her before is not completely unreasonable.</p>

    <p>She should be more proactive.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still didn't speak. He sat cross-legged with his arms folded. All his thoughts were conveyed simultaneously by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"The situation is now very clear. Bai Zhe has become a moonlight dragon. If he wants to activate the cosmic check and balance mechanism, he will inevitably have to revive the other two dragon leaders." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"The other two dragon leaders?" Sun Rong blinked.</p>

    <p>"The three major dragon leaders of the Eternal Dragon Clan. In addition to the Moonlight Dragon, they are the Dark Devouring Dragon. And the Cangyuan Dragon. The Dark Devouring Dragon holds the power of darkness. And the Cangyuan Dragon... As the name suggests, it is actually a water dragon." Wang Ying said .</p>

    <p>In fact, at this point, the remaining people here suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>As we all know, after Aohai has condensed nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes, his ability is also to control sea water.</p>

    <p>The ability is somewhat similar to Cangyuan Dragon.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Aohai's ability is still limited. Because the object that Aohai can control can only be sea water. The configuration of Cangyuanlong is more advanced than Aohai. It can control all water. It is not limited to A kind of sea water.</p>

    <p>"Cangyuan Dragon can control thousands of waters. However, the range of control is limited. Centered on itself, it can only cover one hundred thousand surrounding galaxies. But Aohai can now cover one billion. In terms of range, Aohai's range is even greater. But in terms of maneuverability, Cangyuanlong is stronger." Wang Ying explained.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in summary, there are pros and cons between the two.</p>

    <p>So now Wang Ling's idea is very simple.</p>

    <p>He felt that if he could snatch the dragon bones of Cangyuan Dragon and pour the power of Cangyuan Dragon into Aohai... then Aohai would not only be the Queen of the Sea from now on, but a veritable "Queen of Ten Thousand Waters." !</p>

    <p>From the perspective of Wang Ling, this move can be described as killing two birds with one stone.</p>

    <p>Because the stronger Aohai is, the stronger the crisis management ability of Sun Rong is. If anything happens, she will be able to solve it by herself. There is no need to worry about it anymore.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that as long as Sun Rong is given enough self-protection ability, the girl will not trouble him in the future.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that his plan would bring about the opposite effect.</p>

    <p>"Invisible flirting is the most deadly." At this time, Wang Ying sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>As the shadow of a genuine old stainless steel piece of wood, he felt that this old stainless steel piece of wood would have a long and arduous road ahead emotionally.</p>

    <p>How long will it take to realize this?</p>

    <p>Next year?</p>

    <p>Or. The year after next?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Baobai Group. In the floating boat in the sky. When Wang Ming opened his eyes again, he suddenly heard someone calling him.</p>

    <p>"Master Wu Xin?" The person calling him was an employee of Baobai Group. He was wearing thick protective clothing and asked cautiously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming glanced at him. At this moment, he was standing next to a huge pothole in the Dragon Cemetery.</p>

    <p>This is one of the excavation sites of the Dragon Bones.</p>

    <p>Because of the need to regain the sovereignty of the body, there will be a mental window period when the body is taken over again. On the surface, it looks like it is in a daze. No matter who calls, there will be no response.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this window period is not too long. It is only about ten seconds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Now, these people in the Dragon Cemetery would never think that he had regained his body.</p>

    <p>"Eh... How's the excavation work going?" He didn't show any clues. He still used Master Wu Xin's tone of voice to communicate with these Baby Group employees.</p>

    <p>"Winning the jackpot! Mr. Wu Xin!" The employee of Baobai Group said excitedly: "We have detected the L1289 pit. There is huge energy hidden in the ground! It is very likely that there are parts of Yusanjia buried in it! "</p>

    <p>Yusanjia.</p>

    <p>This is the abbreviation of the three leaders of the dragon clan within the Baobai Group. They are the Moonlight Dragon, the Dark Devouring Dragon and the Cangyuan Dragon.</p>

    <p>At present, except for the keel of Moonlight Dragon, most of the keels of Dark Devouring Dragon and Cangyuan Dragon have not been collected completely. There are still many missing parts.</p>

    <p>So once there is a new discovery about the "Yusanjia", the employees of the Baobai Group who are responsible for the detection will be extremely excited! Because if detected, there will be additional bonuses!</p>

    <p>And this bonus is a huge bonus that is enough to benefit every employee for a lifetime!</p>

    <p>Under such an incentive system, all employees of Baobai Group work as hard as they can. If they take off their protective clothing, the dark circles under their eyes will be clearly visible.</p>

    <p>Therefore, employees of Baobai Group also jokingly call themselves Pandamen.</p>

    <p>"Good job."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming praised. Then he looked at the employee: "Where are the Yusanjia parts that we collected earlier?"</p>

    <p>"It has been strictly protected in the encryption laboratory in the cemetery. No one is allowed to enter." The Baobai Group employee replied.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at this person's employee number and said, "Number 10021."</p>

    <p>"Yes. I'm here!" The man immediately stood at attention and saluted. He replied.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I just suddenly thought of something. I think maybe we can use other methods to find the remaining Yusanjia keel bones. For example, the mutual induction between the keel bones?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "I know. You have done induction experiments before. But the induction experiment I propose now is brand new. But in order to ensure the feasibility of the experiment, I need to go to the place where the keels are stored to take a look."</p>

    <p>"But... you have to apply and go through the process." 10021 replied.</p>

    <p>"As for the application process, everyone in the company will know about my method. But now, only you know it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and said: "10021. If you get my method by then, you can successfully excavate all the Yusanjia keels. You should be able to imagine how big a bonus you and the people in your survey team will get. Right? That will be inexhaustible wealth."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Number 10021 couldn't help but gritted his teeth: "I don't know the location of the encryption laboratory myself. But there is someone I know... He might know. That was my former boss. It was me who captured that woman before. This boss planned it."</p>

    <p>"What woman?"</p>

    <p>"That's the female special forces soldier named Zhai." Number 10021 said.</p>

    <p>"Well, I think about it... very good... that woman... captured her so beautifully!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pretended to be enlightened and put a smile on his face, but in fact, his smile was hiding a knife.</p>

    <p>"So, Mr. Wu Xin, are you really just going to have a look?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Just scan it with my brain waves. You should know how strong my brain waves are."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded and continued to show a harmless smile: "So, you just need to ask the former boss to take me there. Don't worry, I will just take a look and won't go in."</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>Wait until I get in...</p>

    <p>I will demolish your base directly!</p>
