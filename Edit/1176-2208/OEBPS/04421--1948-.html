  <h1>Chapter 1948 Double Agent</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Is there a way to make money by working part-time?</p>

    <p>In fact, in the modern cultivation environment system, there are actually many ways to work and make money. It is not uncommon for high school cultivators to use their vacations to do part-time summer jobs.</p>

    <p>And this is also an effective way to accumulate immortal fate and connections in modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has actually always known that Jiang Yingying is short of money. This time she finally bought a beautiful desk from Lord Diulei. But Wang Ling changed places again. I wonder what she is doing now. Jiang Yingying is desperate.</p>

    <p>It's the kind of despair where people and money are lost.</p>

    <p>In fact, at this time, Sun Rong also vaguely noticed something was wrong with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Her daily life is so tight. How could she suddenly have such a valuable small pot of tea on her body to make a deal with Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>And from the small pot of tea, I'm afraid you'll soon be reminded of the Jiutian Tea House! That's Teng Lao's base!</p>

    <p>In other words, Jiang Yingying is most likely the undercover agent lurking in Number 60 High School that the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception are currently looking for.</p>

    <p>After discovering this astonishing fact, Sun Rong fell silent for a moment. It was exactly the same as Lord Diulei's previous reaction.</p>

    <p>Because it was too easy to find this undercover agent!</p>

    <p>No challenge at all!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt ashamed. She felt that Lord Diulei should have realized Jiang Yingying's true identity long ago. Now he was just teasing Jiang Yingying... He didn't want to end his high school experience card so soon.</p>

    <p>"Yingying, you are too naive." At this time, Sun Rong sighed meaningfully to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Come to think of it, Jiang Yingying himself is also to blame for this matter.</p>

    <p>Knowing clearly that this small pot of tea is from Jiutian Teahouse, but still making a deal openly. Isn't this just rushing to give out Mr. Teng's business card to everyone?</p>

    <p>Maybe even Mr. Teng didn't expect Jiang Yingying to be discovered so quickly.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I just know that I am easily deceived. So I hope that the pretty lady can give me some advice... and introduce me to some reliable jobs." Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>"But in this case, you have to take care of school, training and working at night. It will be very hard." Under the fox mask, Sun Rong's expression was very complicated: "Your grandfather will definitely feel bad if he knows about it."</p>

    <p>"I don't want to cause trouble to grandpa, so I ask the pretty sister to keep it a secret for me. And with the pretty sister here, I don't think others can bully me." Jiang Yingying said innocently and romantically.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a while and finally nodded: "Let's do it. I'll introduce you to a job that's not too tiring. Just go and help look after the store after training with me every day. When customers come over, you can help with the sales. Something. You can earn a minimum of 1,000 yuan a night. If your sales are high, you will get an additional 20% commission. Our training ends at 8pm. You can work until 0pm."</p>

    <p>"The hourly wage is very high! What's the price?" Jiang Yingying laughed instantly.</p>

    <p>She thinks this job is very good. It doesn't take up time. The key is that she can really make money! The daily guarantee is 1,000 yuan + 20% commission. As long as she works hard, she can also become a rich woman!</p>

    <p>"Ahem. It just sells tea. It's a shop opened by a friend of mine." Sun Rong answered.</p>

    <p>"Oh! So it's this. I'm familiar with this! I can do this job!" Jiang Yingying nodded. He said confidently: "Where is the address?"</p>

    <p>"Do you know the Jiutian Teahouse in Zhuquemen? This Xinde Teahouse is just opposite the Jiutian Teahouse."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiang Yingying was stunned for a moment when she heard this.</p>

    <p>Although she had heard about KFC and McDonald's Law early on, she never thought that a tea shop could also open opposite.</p>

    <p>Doesn't this mean that she and Mr. Teng are competing for business...</p>

    <p>The key is that she thought hard. She had passed Jiutian Teahouse several times before, but she had never seen another teahouse opposite the teahouse...</p>

    <p>Eight o'clock in the evening. Training ends.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said goodbye to Jiang Yingying. She watched Jiang Yingying leave. Then she immediately called Jiang Xiaoche: "Brother Xiaoche. How is the situation?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Everything is ready according to your instructions.</p>

    <p>We have opened a new teahouse opposite Jiutian Teahouse." Jiang Xiaoche quickly replied. "Okay, I'm sorry, brother Xiaoche. You should be quick."</p>

    <p>"It's okay! It's all within my duties. But can I ask? Miss, why do you suddenly want to open a teahouse?"</p>

    <p>"Hey, it's okay. She's just a friend of mine. I think she's pitiful, so I opened a teahouse and let her work. That's all."</p>

    <p>"Then why didn't the lady just open it directly? Instead, she commissioned a..."</p>

    <p>"I have my own arrangements. Brother Xiaoche, just pretend you don't know anything." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was stunned after hearing this.</p>

    <p>What kind of poor friend is he? And he still needs a lady to "give alms" in such a roundabout way?</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Jiang Xiaoche has a vague feeling of ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>However, he had already made arrangements for the teahouse. He also followed Sun Rong's instructions and opened the shop using the identity of "Jia Guang."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche also went to investigate specifically who Jia Guang was.</p>

    <p>After a long journey, he discovered that this man was the father of the new transfer student from Number 60 High School. And he heard that this man was a very wealthy upstart.</p>

    <p>So what is the connection between the young lady and this upstart?</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche found that he could not read Sun Rong more and more.</p>

    <p>In other words, there is already a feeling that Sun Rong is getting further and further away.</p>

    <p>He watched Sun Rong grow up. In the past, Sun Rong knew everything about him and even said that he was very dependent on him. But now Jiang Xiaoche has found that there are more and more things about his young lady. An elusive secret.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just like that, Jiang Yingying started her part-time job plan that night. On the way here, she even thought that this might be some kind of hint.</p>

    <p>The beautiful lady is from the Office of Strategic Deception. Now I introduced her to a teahouse job. And then this teahouse happened to open opposite Jiutian Teahouse...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying thought about it carefully in her heart. She felt that there seemed to be a problem somewhere.</p>

    <p>She is well aware of her identity as a spy.</p>

    <p>Since she was here to get information from Teng Lao... so about the identity of the store owner, she felt that she needed to take advantage of her part-time job to get a deeper understanding. Maybe she could learn something.</p>

    <p>According to the address, she found the location of the teahouse. Jiang Yingying almost felt insane because she found that it was really an old teahouse in a remote corner of Zhuquemen Street.</p>

    <p>There is no teahouse sign. There is just an inconspicuous word "tea" written on an extremely shabby-looking flag.</p>

    <p>This flag was deliberately made by Sun Rong by Jiang Xiaoche to make it look inconspicuous. It feels like this teahouse has been here for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Stop hanging around the door. It's here. Come in."</p>

    <p>Just when Jiang Yingying was stunned, the long-lost voice of Taoist Guang suddenly came from the teahouse...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ps: Taoist Guang. Original name: Pang Guang. An old cultivator who appeared in Chapter 393. He was trapped in the magic weapon because he failed to be promoted to Venerated Immortal. He was later rescued by Wang Ling and saw through the secular practice. Determined to stay in the magic weapon ring. Li An works as an online game anchor.</p>
