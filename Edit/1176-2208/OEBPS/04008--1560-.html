  <h1>Chapter 1560 The Spiritual Guy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What no one expected was.</p>

    <p>The news that Jisaki was expelled from school spread quickly within Jiudaohe School.</p>

    <p>And the direction of the wind is very wrong. Almost all public opinions are showing a one-sided trend. Speak for Jisaki.</p>

    <p>As a student union president who is enthusiastic, positive, has excellent academic performance and is willing to provide quality services to students. He was threatened with expulsion from school just because he joined a literary exchange club.</p>

    <p>No matter how you hear this matter, it seems to be a problem with the Academic Affairs Department.</p>

    <p>Condemnation over this incident spread almost overnight on the Internet.</p>

    <p>"No matter how excellent the results are, what's the use of a school that doesn't respect its students!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! How cute little Jiucai is! When I graduated from Jiudaohe, I elected him as the president of the student union. Why did you let him drop out of school? Isn't this cutting off Jiucai!"</p>

    <p>"You don't understand! Jiudaohe is now a foreign-funded school. It is actually controlled by a foreign cultivation education institution. The Jiugong family actually has no control at all! The root of Jiudaohe is rotten. It is completely rotten!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The rhythm of the Internet mainly revolves around the above points.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan, director of the Academic Affairs Office of Jiudaohe, saw this overwhelming public opinion. He was so angry that he felt cold on the spot. He didn't know what was going on in the world.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to create such a momentum of condemnation overnight.</p>

    <p>Among them, there are two main aspects that are adding fuel to the flames.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, Sun Rong, Jisaki planned and organized Gray Cult believers to help Jisaki guide online public opinion.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Teacher Zhou Xiang, who accepted the conditions, set the pace for Jiudaohe's teaching team.</p>

    <p>A two-pronged approach was taken from both students and teachers. This matter spread immediately.</p>

    <p>Yes. Ueki Kimisan miscalculated once again.</p>

    <p>He underestimated the current overall strength of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>After the Rainbow Seven Gang was conquered, the entire student union and all students who were dissatisfied with the Jiudaohe grading system, as long as they had excellent Chinese scores, almost all have joined the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch...</p>

    <p>In addition, the promotional video on Station B has the effect of fueling the situation.</p>

    <p>For a time, many people were very interested in this student organization, which was established with the original purpose of literary exchange.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, as long as public opinion rises, it is very easy to follow the trend.</p>

    <p>There are already many people on the Internet who adapt to the changing circumstances. Since everyone has said yes, it is always right to follow suit.</p>

    <p>If everyone is criticizing the same person or the same thing, then there seems to be no harm in following the trend and stimulating Zaun's blood.</p>

    <p>Saturday, December 19th. Sun Island's national college student ranking closed-door competition has not officially started yet.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe Student Union Office. Jisaki is already crazy busy here.</p>

    <p>Jisaki and Ma Jiao have been in the office since early morning and have not gone out.</p>

    <p>Because more and more people are applying to join Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Some students and teachers from other schools submitted their transcripts...</p>

    <p>For a time, the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch became boiling again.</p>

    <p>In a few days, the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch has grown from nothing to now.</p>

    <p>This is something Jisaki never expected.</p>

    <p>Facing the increasing number of Gray Cult believers, Jisaki naturally felt the pressure doubled.</p>

    <p>In the past few days, the leader of Sun Rong has been guiding him. It will have to wait until the Number 60 High School group returns next week... Jisaki began to feel an inexplicable irritability and anxiety in his heart.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had already anticipated this.</p>

    <p>After these days of comprehensive inspection of Jisaki.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks Jisaki is a person with good character.</p>

    <p>He didn't have much to offer, so he inspired Sun Rong to give something to Jisaki in her name as a gift.</p>

    <p>So that day, Jisaki was in the office looking at the dense roster of believers on the computer. His hair was falling out.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong came to the office with the gift inspired by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Is this given to me by Rong Jiang?" Jisaki showed an expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>"You've worked hard these days. Just a little thought. This is a memory pillowcase. It fits all pillows. It has strong elasticity. Sleeping on it can help you clear your mind."</p>

    <p>"Wow. This material is very comfortable to touch... it must be expensive." Jisaki sighed.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it's not a big deal. Just like it." Sun Rong smiled awkwardly.</p>

    <p>Of course she knew the pillowcase was excellent.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling hadn't personally asked her to send it here. How could she dare to take credit?</p>

    <p>This is something that classmate Wang Ling personally enlightened... If you modify it casually, it will be a priceless treasure.</p>

    <p>There are so many people in this world who can only dream of it.</p>

    <p>"Is Houlang Sang going to compete with the team soon?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. We're leaving soon. The competition starts at three o'clock this afternoon. I'm going to make preparations as well." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Rong Jiang! Houlang Sang, please come on! I will watch the live broadcast and get gifts!"</p>

    <p>"Yeah!" Sun Rong nodded. Then he said goodbye to Jisaki.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations to the leader!"</p>

    <p>Looking at the girl's retreating back, Jisaki held the pillowcase in his hand and bowed to Sun Rong with great excitement.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Rong feels like I have a sense of being possessed by Wuji, the Mingjiao sect.</p>

    <p>But their Gray Cult. is obviously just a literary exchange club!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Island's national high school ranking closed-door competition is about to begin.</p>

    <p>Jisaki's side is busy recruiting newcomers. Wang Ling's side is waiting to win the championship. And the remaining domestic side, Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi, are also working hard to treat Zhou Xiang's son's leg. Things.</p>

    <p>This time in Jiudaohe. Zhou Xiang took the lead in hacking Ueki Kimisan in the teaching team. It is estimated that it will be found out soon.</p>

    <p>He originally chose this high-paying career to work abroad to pay for the medical expenses for his son's leg treatment.</p>

    <p>Now that the treatment for the leg has been settled, it doesn't matter to Zhou Xiang that the next step is to break the pot.</p>

    <p>Besides. He has put up with Ueki Kimisan for a long time!</p>

    <p>If he hadn't always looked out for his son's face, Zhou Xiang felt that he might have fought tooth and nail with Ueki Kimisan.</p>

    <p>"This is it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi drove to Zhou Xiang's home with Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This is an old-fashioned Xiuzhen residential area. It is very old. Although it is in Songhai City, it is rare to see this kind of courtyard-style building in the city center.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi wore a black cloak and simply changed his appearance.</p>

    <p>Because now Sun Rong is competing on her behalf.</p>

    <p>In order to cooperate with Sun Rong's performance there, Jiugong Liangzi simply asked for leave from school these days and did not go to school.</p>

    <p>What Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect the most was.</p>

    <p>These days, she actually lives in Zhuo Yi's house...</p>

    <p>She was indeed deceived by Zhuo Yi. It was said that she wanted to fulfill her obligations and responsibilities as a bodyguard.</p>

    <p>Although the man next to her didn't do anything to her.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi still had some strange feelings in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, is classmate Zhou Ziyi at home?" In front of the courtyard, Zhuo Yi knocked on the very old-fashioned rivet door.</p>

    <p>The red paint on it has peeled off. It looks old.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi pushed the door gently and found that the slot inside the door was loose. It was not completely locked.</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone there?" he and Jiugong Liangzi asked as they entered the courtyard.</p>

    <p>Before coming to see Zhou Ziyi. Zhuo Yi actually imagined many scenes.</p>

    <p>He originally thought he would see a young man pushing a wheelchair out, carrying a weak body and living in despair.</p>

    <p>As a result, not long after he finished speaking, he heard a hearty shout from inside: "Come on, come on!"</p>

    <p>Above the eaves, the boy without legs was standing upside down. He was skillfully supporting his body with his arms instead of his feet.</p>

    <p>Flying over the walls all the way. Then he handsomely completed a 360-degree full-body pirouette in the air.</p>

    <p>At the end, there was a "bang" sound. My head hit the ground and made a hole on the spot...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Zhou, it's not the New Year yet, so there's no need to give this big gift." Zhuo Yi showed an awkward yet polite smile.</p>

    <p>"Do you feel any pain?" Jiugong Liangzi wanted to go up and help him.</p>

    <p>As a result, Zhou Ziyi scratched his head and climbed up with support on his body: "It's okay, it's okay. I'm a energetic guy!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "A spirited young man..."</p>

    <p>Apart from losing my legs, I also have some mental problems...</p>
