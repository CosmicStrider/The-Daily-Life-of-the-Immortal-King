  <h1>Chapter 1510 Why did you provoke him?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>So, while eating, Sun Rong had a clear feeling that he was being arranged.</p>

    <p>A secret corner. Surrounded by familiar people. This sense of security has undoubtedly alleviated Wang Ling's "social phobia" a lot.</p>

    <p>The food at Jiudaohe High School is excellent. It's all cultivator food.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the nutrition of every student, so in Jiudaohe High School, the only issue is food, which is the same for everyone.</p>

    <p>There is no issue of differential treatment.</p>

    <p>The main ingredient of today's lunch is black rubber beef cubes. It is said that the beef is spiritual cattle raised in the pasture behind Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>He grew up eating specially prepared feed. The meat is delicious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling have never seen a school set up several farms to provide itself with food sources for its own lunch...</p>

    <p>It is indeed one of the most famous schools on Sun Island!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was drinking fish soup. He was not feeling very emotional.</p>

    <p>He didn't know where he was. It was actually Akano Jisaki's seat.</p>

    <p>Pity...</p>

    <p>Because Jiugong Xinghui greeted Jisaki in advance and told him not to act rashly.</p>

    <p>Akano Jisaki had no choice but to sit on the other side holding in his anger. He chewed the beef nuggets in his mouth with an aggrieved look on his face.</p>

    <p>It's like gnawing on the flesh of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He knew that his mentality was abnormal.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, those who have come from afar are like guests. Anyway, Number 60 High School's group is only here for a few days... He really can't be angry.</p>

    <p>As a student council president, he should show his tolerance and magnanimity.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why.</p>

    <p>After Jisaki noticed that Sun Rong's eyes were always on the pretty boy named Wang Houlang.</p>

    <p>The breath in his heart was like old blood scab clogged in the cardiovascular system. Jisaki found it increasingly difficult to breathe.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ji, if you really like Rong Jiang so much, then find a chance to express your love as soon as possible. It's only a few days anyway." At this time, the Kongque man who had targeted Wang Ling in class suddenly suddenly He spoke.</p>

    <p>Jisaki suddenly became incoherent: "Who...who likes her! How could I...like that...terrible woman..."</p>

    <p>He said that, but the expression on his face completely betrayed him.</p>

    <p>The burning face was like the medium-rare beef cubes being flipped on the dinner plate. It showed a fresh red color.</p>

    <p>"It's so obvious. President."</p>

    <p>At this time, the short-haired vice president of the student union codenamed "Ma Jiao" spoke.</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "..."</p>

    <p>She enjoyed the food on the plate with a blank expression and said: "Since you like it so much, you should seize the opportunity to take action. Do you want me to prepare the drug and the room key?"</p>

    <p>"Your idea is very dangerous...I am a gentleman!" Jisaki's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>He felt that the vice president "Ma Jiao" around him was a scheming woman.</p>

    <p>This guy can always say some terrible things calmly...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid he's the kind of person in the legend who is always black when cut open.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, in a few words between Kongque Nan and Ma Jiao, Jisaki's real troubles were revealed.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that his attitude towards Sun Rong should be "fear."</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of "fear" that he tried desperately to work hard.</p>

    <p>Practicing day and night every day, learning various theoretical knowledge of cultivation...</p>

    <p>The purpose is to appear in front of the girl with a better attitude when we meet next time.</p>

    <p>What Jisaki didn't expect was that the "fear" he understood was actually "like."</p>

    <p>"So. Is this what it feels like to like..."</p>

    <p>Jisaki's face was slightly red. He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Looking in the direction of Sun Rong, while holding his face, he used the knife and fork in his hand to play with the dices of beef on the dinner plate.</p>

    <p>But now he suddenly realized why he disliked that classmate "Wang Houlang" so much.</p>

    <p>It turns out. It was all because of jealousy.</p>

    <p>"Can you guys do me a favor?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jisaki looked at Kongque and Ma Jiao beside him and asked.</p>

    <p>"Have you finally made up your mind? President."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao sneered: "I still have a lot of medicine there."</p>

    <p>"I told you. I don't want you to be drugged. Can your thoughts be normal? Don't be so dark..." Jisaki was speechless.</p>

    <p>"It's not medicine. What else could it be?" Ma Jiao sighed.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, where did you get so many medicines?" Even Kongque was a little curious now.</p>

    <p>"It was all in the past. Someone else gave it to me. They wanted to sleep with me. Then I found the medicine bottle and I confiscated it."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao said calmly: "So I received a lot of strange medicines. There are all kinds of medicines."</p>

    <p>"Sleep with you..." Both Jisaki and Kongque were shocked.</p>

    <p>They are relatively familiar with Ma Jiao, so they don't have such thoughts.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Ma Jiao's facial features are indeed exquisite. The freckles on her face are actually harmless. They only need to be covered with simple makeup. That is a standard beauty.</p>

    <p>To put it simply, Ma Jiao is indeed the cute and cute type after makeup.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for knowing that Ma Jiao is black when cut, he looks cute but is extremely sinister on the inside.</p>

    <p>Jisaki and Kongque can't guarantee that they won't have such evil thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it strange? I look pretty cute, right?" Ma Jiao chuckled.</p>

    <p>"eh..." Jisaki said noncommittally: "So. What happened to those people who wanted to sleep with you?"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao thought for a while and concluded: "I slept with the good-looking ones. I had them sterilized by the ugly ones."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Jisaki and Kongque suddenly felt that they were not well.</p>

    <p>End of topic.</p>

    <p>Jisaki quickly put forward his request: "Can you think of a way to take that Houlang Sang away from me? I want to have dinner with the Sun Rong girl..."</p>

    <p>In fact, he really has no other ill intentions.</p>

    <p>I just want to have a meal with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Although out of jealousy, his attitude towards Wang Ling is somewhat unfriendly.</p>

    <p>But Jisaki actually has no intention of hurting anyone.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, he has now clarified his emotional attitude towards Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was also because of Jiugong Xinghui's previous communication with him that Jisaki would not act rashly.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to go away?" Kongque man frowned: "It's not easy to go away from that location. There are people blocking it outside. I think it's better to take some medicine. I think laxatives will do."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao thought for a moment and said, "Isn't the laxative too light? Wouldn't it be better to have direct food poisoning? Let them lie in the hospital for a few days."</p>

    <p>Jisaki was frightened when he heard this. He wiped the sweat from his face: "By the way, can you use a more normal method?"</p>

    <p>Is it a normal way...</p>

    <p>This guy is so troublesome.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao thought to herself. She couldn't help but sigh: "Then I have no choice but to use that one..."</p>

    <p>Kongque Man immediately understood what Ma Jiao said: "What are you talking about?"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao: "Yes. That's the one."</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "???"</p>

    <p>So which one is this?!</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao: "President, I still remember whether the principal of our school summoned an internet celebrity scientist a while ago."</p>

    <p>"Oh...you said that master named Shou Chong..." Jisaki remembered.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Ma Jiao nodded: "Actually, Master Shou Chong specially arranged a gift for our student union before he left. He renovated all the electric massage sofas in the cafeteria."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't I know..." Jisaki was surprised.</p>

    <p>"The president is busy with official duties. Is it necessary to know this kind of thing?"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao sneered: "It's just a gift left by Master Shou Chong. I haven't found a suitable opportunity to experiment with it yet."</p>

    <p>"It won't be very dangerous..."</p>

    <p>"No." Ma Jiao said calmly: "It is said that the renovated massage sofa has the ability to prevent seat overlording."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"President, don't worry. I just modified the massage head and the power adjustment function. The massager on the sofa will start automatically later. Houlang Sang is a Foundation Building period. He will definitely not be able to withstand that kind of intensity... As long as he gets up, it will be long." Won't the opportunity come?"</p>

    <p>At first glance, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this method.</p>

    <p>At least it is much more reliable than unilateral poisoning.</p>

    <p>However, because there has not been any specific experiment in modifying the massage chair before, so what is the specific effect?</p>

    <p>No one here can tell clearly.</p>

    <p>Well, let's try it first.</p>

    <p>So Jisaki nodded and agreed to the plan proposed by Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was sitting and resting. Suddenly, he felt the massage sofa under him suddenly start.</p>

    <p>Without any warning, the massage sofa began to fall backwards.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming vaguely seemed to hear the sound of an electric drill coming from the massage sofa.</p>

    <p>But this sound is very subtle.</p>

    <p>If the distance is further away, it will actually be difficult to hear clearly.</p>

    <p>"Did someone do anything?" Wang Ming instantly guessed what was going on.</p>

    <p>He used his brain waves to search the entire cafeteria.</p>

    <p>By capturing the micro-expressions on each person's face, Wang Ming can easily determine who did it.</p>

    <p>And soon, he directly locked onto the Jisaki trio over there.</p>

    <p>Although the eyes of these three people did not directly touch this place.</p>

    <p>But it is still difficult to escape Wang Ming's gaze.</p>

    <p>"How dare you attack Lingzi? These three little guys are quite courageous." The corners of Wang Ming's lips raised slightly.</p>

    <p>High school students are still high school students after all. This method of secretly stumbling upon Wang Ming actually seems a bit childish.</p>

    <p>And from a technical perspective.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming judged that these modified sofa and massage chairs were probably not made by the three people from Jisaki.</p>

    <p>After using the mechanical eye part of "Wang Ling Number 3" to scan the massage chair.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of the interior configuration structure and design ideas of the massage chair.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming feels that it is a bit of the work of the internet celebrity scientist "Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>The analysis was as fierce as a tiger. Wang Ming originally wanted to fight back. However, he felt that Wang Ling did not feel any discomfort, so he was not in a hurry to take action.</p>

    <p>"How's it going? Ling Ling? Is there anything you can't lose?" Wang Ming asked softly.</p>

    <p>"No."Wang Ling closed his eyes and said through the voice transmission.</p>

    <p>For the massage sofa that suddenly started running.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling was surprised inside, the expression on his face was still very calm.</p>

    <p>A special massage sofa modified by Master Shou Chong. The massage heads have been changed to an electric drill style design.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the massage intensity has been greatly enhanced on the original basis.</p>

    <p>Under the Nascent Soul stage, the number of people who can lie down on this modified massage sofa for more than 10 seconds is very limited.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jisaki was even ready for Wang Ling to get up on his own initiative.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why.</p>

    <p>He observed this scene from a distance.</p>

    <p>It feels like Wang Ling is enjoying it...</p>

    <p>"Is this okay? How do I feel? Houlang Sang has a comfortable expression on his face." Jisaki's eyes twitched.</p>

    <p>And Ma Jiao didn't quite understand this situation: "It shouldn't be like this... It's already the maximum strength. According to Master Shou Chong, with such strength, the Foundation Building period can't stand up in just a few seconds."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is indeed enjoying it.</p>

    <p>Although the effect of this massage sofa actually looks average to Wang Ling, it feels just right...</p>

    <p>After all, there are not many massage sofas these days that can make Wang Ling feel good.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling is quite strenuous. Ordinary mechanical massage equipment has almost no feeling for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But this one by Shou Chong made Wang Ling feel a little bit more of the presence of the massage head.</p>

    <p>The force is very small. But at least it can relax the muscles...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Someone is taking action against him.</p>

    <p>But this method is considered polite.</p>

    <p>So he was not unhappy.</p>

    <p>I just closed my eyes and lay on the massage sofa for a while.</p>

    <p>Half an hour later, I saw a group of people from Number 60 High School leaving.</p>

    <p>Jisaki immediately looked scratching his head: "How could this happen! Didn't you say that this massage chair is very powerful!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know either. But Master Shou Chong did say that."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was innocent: "If you don't believe it, just try it and you will know."</p>

    <p>"Just try it!"</p>

    <p>Jisaki walked over angrily and lay down on the spot where Wang Ling was lying just now.</p>

    <p>Three seconds later, screams came...</p>

    <p>"Ahh..."</p>

    <p>Jisaki jumped up from the massage sofa with a painful look on his face.</p>

    <p>Then face to the ground.</p>

    <p>The whole person fell heavily to the ground with a "plop."</p>

    <p>The moment the massage head came into contact with his body.</p>

    <p>The severe pain is hard to describe in words...</p>

    <p>It's like there are 100,000 electric drills on the back. Crazy use of the electro-optical poison dragon drill to urge the unscrupulous operator named Ku Xuan to code...</p>

    <p>Later, Jisaki was carried into the infirmary by Ma Jiao and Kongque with his butt sticking out.</p>

    <p>Preliminary examination results are: waist muscle sprain and slight bone fracture...</p>

    <p>For a cultivator, it's not a particularly serious injury. But if he lay there for a few more seconds, Jisaki felt like he was going to die.</p>

    <p>"Does it hurt so much? That Houlang Sang actually held on. It's incredible." Ma Jiao sighed: "It seems that this massage sofa is really strong. Speaking of Kongque, do you want to try it too?"</p>

    <p>"No, no, no..." Kongque was still frightened.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Jisaki's personal experience.</p>

    <p>He understood how powerful the modified massage sofa was.</p>

    <p>This is probably what is legendary.</p>

    <p>Try and die...</p>

    <p>Jisaki is like this in the early stage of a Golden Core. He just lays down on it in the Foundation Building stage. But he can't just burst into orange blossoms.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night. Wang Ling and the group originally planned to return to the mansion arranged by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>However, Jiudaohe High School organized a welcome party. Under the strong suggestion of Yingxian Heming, they settled in the school building arranged by Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Welcome party. Such an occasion is not suitable for Wang Ling. Wang Ling chooses to stay alone in the dormitory.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there are three of them. As long as Sun Rong and Wang Ming attend as representatives.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is originally optional.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, classmate Wang Ling, just leave this matter to me and second brother. Remember to close the doors and windows, and if any other girls harass you, remember to tell me!" Before leaving, Sun Rong said to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming watched from a distance, holding back a smile.</p>

    <p>No matter how you look at it, you feel like the couple are saying goodbye...</p>

    <p>But regarding the question of whether Wang Ling will be disturbed by other girls.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong has already made arrangements.</p>

    <p>Because it is located opposite the girls' dormitory building. Zhai Yin's dormitory window is facing the door of Wang Ling's dormitory.</p>

    <p>If a sneaky girl passes by the door of Wang Ling's room.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin will notice it immediately.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, she felt Sun Rong was thinking too much.</p>

    <p>Even if a girl comes to look for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>With the determination of Wang Ling, it is absolutely impossible to make such a mistake.</p>

    <p>For a frigid, ascetic straight man who wants to play tricks on this.</p>

    <p>The success rate is 0%...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At about seven o'clock in the evening, when Wang Ling opened his eyes, he found a figure appearing in front of him.</p>

    <p>The visitor was none other than Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>He didn't come in through the front door. He appeared directly in front of Wang Ling by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Met Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng clasped his hands together. He was wearing the uniform of Number 60 High School. He still looked as funny as before: "Zhenren must have noticed that there are half-ghosts in this school..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>What the monk calls "half-ghost" is actually a professional term.</p>

    <p>What it means is that it is not a complete "ghost." It has not completely turned into a ghost, but it has the possibility of transforming into a ghost.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning when I entered Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Monk Jin Deng were keenly aware of the unusual features of Jiudaohe High School...</p>

    <p>Because the relationship with "Jiugong Xinghui" has been tested before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already has a general understanding of Jiugong Xinghui and the operating mode of the demon inside him.</p>

    <p>The opponent uses hair manipulation to control ghosts remotely.</p>

    <p>Such ability is very terrifying.</p>

    <p>And almost every strand of hair is bound to a ghost.</p>

    <p>But where did such a large number of ghosts come from?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also thinking about this issue at that time.</p>

    <p>Now. The answer to the question is found by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It would be easy to cultivate ghosts through these half-ghosts...</p>

    <p>Throughout Jiudaohe High School, due to strong xenophobia, academic pressure and campus violence, there are many students who have become mentally distorted.</p>

    <p>Some of these students have already become "half-ghosts" and some are about to become "half-ghosts"...</p>

    <p>These are all potential stocks to become ghosts.</p>

    <p>Therefore. For Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirits.</p>

    <p>The entire Jiudaohe High School is their "ghost breeding ground."</p>

    <p>After discovering this secret.</p>

    <p>The first thing Monk Jin Deng did was to come to Wang Ling for discussion.</p>

    <p>He did not act rashly directly.</p>

    <p>"I originally wanted to directly use {Right Buddha Light} to rescue those students who have not yet become ghosts. However, doing so may alert the snake." Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>By doing this, they can indeed save many students.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this is also helping Jiugong Xinghui destroy evidence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has the ability to make Jiugong Xinghui's plans fail.</p>

    <p>But such an anti-human villain.</p>

    <p>If you fail to get exposure in the end. Accept everyone's scorn and sanctions...</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling always feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>For such a villain, even if Wang Ling crushes him to death like an ant, I'm afraid no one will feel sorry for her.</p>

    <p>However, if possible, Wang Ling still hopes that the evil deeds done by Jiugong Xinghui and the Zhai Xing Group behind him can be exposed to the world.</p>

    <p>Instead of using his endless energy to suppress it single-handedly...</p>

    <p>Because then.</p>

    <p>People will never learn to reflect. In the end they can only go backwards.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to be a hero.</p>

    <p>Six years ago, Zhuo Yi. He knew he was outmatched but still raised his sword. The warrior who charged towards Thuntihan Ha like a god of war...</p>

    <p>And like Zhuo Yi, who rush towards the strongest "rebels" without hesitation, they still exist in this world, but there are not a few of them.</p>

    <p>In this situation. Wang Ling feels that it is more important to collect criminal evidence about Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>This is actually not difficult.</p>

    <p>You just need to wait for the right time to reverse the operation.</p>

    <p>There are so many "half-ghosts" in Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Since Jiugong Xinghui regards this place as his "ghost breeding farm", there must be a way to force these half-ghosts into real ghosts.</p>

    <p>So what Wang Ling has to do is simple.</p>

    <p>Since you've turned people into ghosts, wouldn't it be better for him to go and turn them back when the time comes?</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This process is just like mathematics.</p>

    <p>From great truth to simplicity. To put it bluntly, in the end it is nothing more than mathematical formulas.</p>

    <p>Since it is a formula, it can be reversed.</p>

    <p>After a brief communication via voice transmission, the monk completely understood Wang Ling's thoughts: "I fully support Ling Zhenren's decision."</p>

    <p>For a monk, it is always right to follow Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although from the moment he entered the island, the monk has always had the idea of spreading "the light of the right path" to the entire Sun Island...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the story of Jiugong Xinghui recruiting "100,000 shady soldiers" is too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>As an accomplished monk, he is the most holy person in Buddhism.</p>

    <p>As soon as Monk Jin Deng entered Sun Island, he felt that the island was full of ghosts...</p>

    <p>If it weren't for his stronger self-control now, the monk would no longer be able to recognize his move.</p>

    <p>People in Buddhism have a mysophobia. The most taboo thing is seeing such dirty things floating in front of their eyes.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ling is so calm.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng suddenly felt the gap in concentration between himself and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Ling Zhenren. He is so calm..."</p>

    <p>After the exchange, the monk was filled with emotion. He felt that he still had a lot to learn from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now since there is no need for him to take action.</p>

    <p>Then. Just follow what Wang Ling means and stay put.</p>

    <p>The monk has nothing else to do.</p>

    <p>I could only shrink back to the staff dormitory arranged for me by Jiudaohe High School. I hid and silently solved the function questions...</p>

    <p>Knowledge is power.</p>

    <p>The charm of functions. How can ordinary people understand it?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Forced ghosts...</p>

    <p>Thinking of what I just discussed with Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little funny.</p>

    <p>He probably knows Jiugong Xinghui's methods.</p>

    <p>There are many "half-ghosts" here.</p>

    <p>He judged that Jiugong Xinghui used hair to remotely control these potential "half-ghosts." He forced the half-ghosts to become ghosts...</p>

    <p>It is mainly determined by the "negative energy" emitted by the "half-ghost."</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>What would happen if I absorbed all the negative energy here?</p>

    <p>He admitted. It seemed a bit fishy.</p>

    <p>But. As long as it works.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling closed his eyes slightly.</p>

    <p>For a time, countless resentful voices poured into his mind.</p>

    <p>"Ah! This question is so difficult! I can't do it!"</p>

    <p>"Damn it. Why are there so many homeworks today? Why do I feel like I can't finish them! It seems that I have to get up early tomorrow to copy the homework! But if I copy the homework, what should I do in the exam!"</p>

    <p>"No... I can't watch it anymore... This is definitely the last one. Keep reading. I'm going to suffer from kidney failure at a young age..."</p>

    <p>"I didn't bully Yezi because I liked her... She is obviously that kind of person. I don't want to apologize to her..."</p>

    <p>"The little bitch next door is having sex again. She obviously has a boyfriend but she still dresses so ostentatiously."</p>

    <p>"Hey, I failed the test again. I'm still two points short of a perfect score. If I don't get a perfect score, my life will be ruined."</p>

    <p>"This damn Ku Xuan. Updates are so slow every day. Why don't he have any self-awareness? He is obviously a maternal solo author. What kind of love story is he writing? Fight for me! I want to see Wang Ling pretend So hot!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sounds like this. There are many, many more...</p>

    <p>Today's teenagers are under great pressure to study. Various mental imbalances are also very common.</p>

    <p>Especially before the college entrance examination. The last straw for a teenager. It may be just a paper, an insignificant-sounding sentence, or just a hurtful word...</p>

    <p>Therefore, almost all schools have psychological teachers responsible for psychological counseling, who are ready to regulate children's psychological problems at any time.</p>

    <p>He condensed all the resentment of the teenagers in the air around him.</p>

    <p>Full of negative energy, it turned into a black ball the size of a basketball and sat in the palm of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling uses these collected negative energies as bait.</p>

    <p>After waiting for a while, I felt a sudden sound of a foreign object breaking through the air behind me...</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, it's here."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm.</p>

    <p>He quickly crushed the negative energy ball in his hand. Then he quickly grabbed the hair that was trying to reach his forehead...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. The moment Jiugong Xinghui's hair was grabbed by Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>That familiar feeling comes back...</p>

    <p>The demon spirit and Jiugong Xinghui were frightened at the same time.</p>

    <p>This!</p>

    <p>This familiar smell...</p>

    <p>This familiar technique...</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. That suffocating feeling came over again.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui was frightened and couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p>

    <p>She does not believe that Wang Houlang is the ghost named "Houlang."</p>

    <p>But now, facing the direct showdown of Wang Ling, Jiugong Xinghui suddenly became a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui: "He's so good. Why did you mess with him!"</p>

    <p>The Demon Spirit was aggrieved: "I started out aiming for the Ohinoko child... Suddenly, I felt a huge amount of negative energy coalescing inside the Jiudao and its interior. The hair was automatically attracted to it."</p>

    <p>It's obvious. This is a trap.</p>

    <p>But out of fear of having my hair pulled out one after another in the morning. Fortunately, this time the demon was well prepared.</p>

    <p>Her response was very quick.</p>

    <p>After judging that his hair was grabbed, he immediately used the technique of "gecko tail cutting" and automatically gave up that hair.</p>

    <p>Eh?</p>

    <p>Is this scary?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finds it a bit funny.</p>

    <p>He lifted the gradually whitening hair from his fingers like dust.</p>

    <p>The demon thought he had escaped successfully.</p>

    <p>But in fact. Just at the moment when Wang Ling grabbed that hair.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has locked the frequency of the demon's psychic signal.</p>

    <p>His fishing technique just now was designed to target the demon spirits.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>As long as it is within the confines of Jiudaohe High School, no matter how the demon changes its psychic frequency or hides itself, it will be ineffective for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is sitting cross-legged in the bedroom.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Countless air currents separated from Wang Ling's body, forming clones invisible to ordinary people. Then they suddenly spread to the surroundings.</p>

    <p>Through what just happened, Wang Ling has already felt that Jiudaohe is inside. Some students have been forcibly turned into "ghosts" by demons.</p>

    <p>While he was controlling the movements of the demon spirits, he was also thinking about rescuing these students.</p>

    <p>And now...</p>

    <p>Fight back.</p>

    <p>It's officially started.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the girls dormitory building in Area C of Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>A girl named Noko Ohira just took a nap. When she woke up, she found that her appearance had changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>Cat...</p>

    <p>Cat-eared girl?</p>

    <p>She stared at herself in the mirror. For a moment, she felt that the world had become abnormal.</p>

    <p>The cat ears on the top of her head and the cat whiskers on her cheeks. Everything that happened seemed to be telling her.</p>

    <p>She is being "catified."</p>

    <p>And. This is definitely not a dream.</p>

    <p>If it's just because of the extra pair of cat ears on her head, maybe Noko Ohira can still accept it.</p>

    <p>But now Noko Ohira discovered that his face has gradually turned into that of a cat. In addition to the whiskers, there is also a light layer of fluff.</p>

    <p>Although she likes cats very much, she still can't accept the fact that she has turned into a cat-eared girl...</p>

    <p>Mainly. The shape of this cat-eared girl is too ugly!</p>

    <p>Not two-dimensional at all!</p>

    <p>The skin is not only hairy but wrinkled.</p>

    <p>Ugly Noko Ohira almost cried.</p>

    <p>In the year when she first entered Jiudaohe, Noko Ohira was still a student in Class S.</p>

    <p>She loves animals. Especially kittens.</p>

    <p>I often use my pocket money to buy cat food to feed the little guys on campus.</p>

    <p>And this kind of behavior seemed to offend the hidden "perverts" in Class S.</p>

    <p>They are all twisted cat abusers. They often make videos of cat abuse and sell them on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Noko Ohira's behavior of feeding stray cats angered this group of cat abusers.</p>

    <p>Then... a two-year school violence began...</p>

    <p>All kinds of humiliating words in class every day, erasers in water bottles and various additives. Even the homework she handed in would be wiped out by someone with hands and feet. The most terrifying thing was that the cat abusers blamed all the cat abuse incidents. Noko Ohira's head...</p>

    <p>Noko Ohira's grades plummeted.</p>

    <p>From Class S. I dropped to Class C.</p>

    <p>She began to become autistic and unwilling to communicate with others.</p>

    <p>She also tried asking the teacher for help.</p>

    <p>The teacher told her.</p>

    <p>Those people in Class S are all powerful people. They can tolerate it as long as they can.</p>

    <p>She also tried to seek help from her parents.</p>

    <p>Her parents told her.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe is a famous school. Since you study here, you must learn to integrate into the environment. Don't do something unsociable...</p>

    <p>No one really understands her.</p>

    <p>Really understand her thoughts...</p>

    <p>Even the closest people around her didn't bring her any comfort.</p>

    <p>Over time and over time.</p>

    <p>Noko Ohira's spirit completely collapsed.</p>

    <p>She felt like she was living like an aimless wandering soul.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that there were still several kittens in Jiudaohe that needed care, Noko Ohira might have chosen to end his life long ago.</p>

    <p>As for tonight's welcome party, Noko Ohira naturally didn't dare to attend.</p>

    <p>She knows it very well.</p>

    <p>If he passes by, it will be nothing more than another kind of humiliation.</p>

    <p>At this time, Noko Ohira, who did not know that he had been forced to become a "ghost", stood in front of the mirror and stared blankly at the changes that had taken place on his body.</p>

    <p>Her claws seemed to be even sharper than before. The gleaming edge resembled a razor blade.</p>

    <p>Scarlet eyes and a cat tail with barbs. It was like a whip. With just a slight wave, the wall behind it completely collapsed under the powerful blow of the tail...</p>

    <p>"I...did I really become a monster?" Noko Ohira didn't know what happened to him.</p>

    <p>And the next moment, she felt her head hurt.</p>

    <p>Countless voices swirled in my mind.</p>

    <p>The voices encouraged her...</p>

    <p>Want her to take revenge for all the experiences that have happened to her...</p>

    <p>Revenge those who have bullied you!</p>

    <p>In a daze, Noko Ohira's mind flashed through many poor kittens he had seen.</p>

    <p>These kittens were caught by cat abusers. They were tortured to death with utility knives. Their fur was pulled out, burned, electrocuted... Those cat abusers inflicted their tyranny on these weak lives to show off their strength.</p>

    <p>Gradually, an inexplicable anger began to rise in Noko Ohira's heart.</p>

    <p>Just when she felt as if she was about to be swallowed up by hatred.</p>

    <p>A strange figure suddenly appeared in front of her.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than the alter ego of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you." Wang Ling's clone said.</p>

    <p>These clones were originally sent by Wang Ling to reform these students who had turned into "ghosts."</p>

    <p>The clone represents the will of Wang Ling. But its personality is actually different from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's clone has an extremely advanced AI mechanism.</p>

    <p>You can automatically judge the situation in front of you and adjust yourself to what these students who need to be influenced most want to see.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>When Noko Ohira saw the clone of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She felt that the boy in front of her seemed to be glowing, like a little sun.</p>

    <p>"You are..." Noko Ohira said hesitantly.</p>

    <p>"My name is Houlang. I am here to help you restore your human body." Wang Ling's clone spoke.</p>

    <p>Determined based on the avatar's AI mechanism.</p>

    <p>Ever since Noko Ohira entered Jiudaohe High School, no one had ever spoken to her so gently.</p>

    <p>So using the gentle route is the best way to break through.</p>

    <p>"Now that things have happened, can I really change back again..." Noko Ohira shed tears.</p>

    <p>"Actually, you've been restraining yourself, haven't you."</p>

    <p>The clone of Wang Ling smiled. It was very natural.</p>

    <p>But such a smile is almost invisible on the body.</p>

    <p>"Just like when you are talking to me now, your tears fall involuntarily. This proves that you actually don't want to become a ghost..."</p>

    <p>"You are a kind girl. This is not your problem. You rescued those stray cats. It also proves that you have a kind heart."</p>

    <p>"So from now on, please continue to be kind...all kind people deserve to be treated kindly."</p>

    <p>"I..." Noko Ohira's tears couldn't stop anymore.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, she felt a trace of warm spiritual energy on her forehead entering her body.</p>

    <p>Subsequently, all the "ghost-like" characteristics on his body quickly disappeared in a state visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"I actually did it..." Noko Ohira looked at what was happening to her body in disbelief.</p>

    <p>"It's all trivial."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took back his hand: "Okay. My mission has been accomplished. See you later..."</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling's clone disappeared, Noko Ohira suddenly plucked up the courage to stop him: "I...how should I repay you!"</p>

    <p>"No need to repay."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's clone responded: "Continue to exercise your kindness. This is the best reward."</p>

    <p>After all. Wang Ling of Ontology has also done many good things.</p>

    <p>And they are always anonymous.</p>

    <p>Noko Ohira's face turned red.</p>

    <p>Because I have never been treated so tenderly and kindly. Noko Ohira couldn't tell whether it was touched or liked.</p>

    <p>She looked at the back of Wang Ling's clone. She mustered up her last courage: "Houlang Sang!!"</p>

    <p>Eh?</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling's clone came to his senses, he saw a huge shadow rushing towards him.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the clone reacted very quickly. He directly stretched out his hand and pressed Noko Ohira's body.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I'm not used to being too close to people."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry Houlang Sang... I was rude..." Noko Ohira's face was obviously a little disappointed: "Then... can you give me a gentle hug? Just a hug..."</p>

    <p>"Out of the question."</p>

    <p>This is a matter of principle.</p>

    <p>The clone's refusal was also very decisive.</p>

    <p>He doesn't want to leave any illusions to these boys/girls.</p>

    <p>So it's not just for "Noko Ohira." It's also done to the rest of the people. The clones of Wang Ling also do the same.</p>

    <p>Just because everyone's situation is different.</p>

    <p>The avatars of Wang Ling also respond in different ways.</p>

    <p>When facing the clone of Noko Ohira. Wang Ling, he refused rather decisively.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Noko Ohira was influenced by many clones of Wang Ling that night. The students who became human again could not remember what Wang Ling looked like for a while.</p>

    <p>She/they only remember.</p>

    <p>The boy called himself "Houlang."</p>

    <p>It's like a god descending to earth. It's full of sunshine.</p>

    <p>Appearing in front of her/them when they need it most.</p>

    <p>Use the gentlest words in the world to melt her/their bruised hearts.</p>

    <p>It's like a dream.</p>

    <p>In other words, this is a dream!</p>

    <p>Is there a boy in this world who is more handsome and considerate than Houlang Sang?</p>

    <p>She/they regard this memory as the most cherished secret in their lives.</p>

    <p>I will also carry this secret with me.</p>

    <p>Continue to live hard with all the beauty and kindness...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mini-Series (not related to the main series or extras).</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: Can classmate Wang Ling give me a gentle hug? Just a hug...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: No! This is another price!</p>
