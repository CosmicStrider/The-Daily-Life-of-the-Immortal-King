  <h1>Chapter 1478 Zhuo Yi! Danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At 8:30 that night, the Dragon in the central square of the ancient street started the dreamlike fountain show on time.</p>

    <p>Eighty-eight dragon heads slowly raised their heads in everyone's sight. Many people who saw Dragon for the first time were surprised.</p>

    <p>This is one of the famous scenes before Dragon starts the fountain show. It is also called: the dragon raises its head.</p>

    <p>However, this is not transformed by modern technology. It is exquisite ancient mechanism craftsmanship.</p>

    <p>In the old days, it was possible to develop such a high-tech fountain through mechanical design.</p>

    <p>All we can say is the engineer who built this Dragon.</p>

    <p>He is indeed an extraordinary talent.</p>

    <p>However, there is still no definite answer to the question of who is the creator of Dragon. Experts in the field of history have debated this issue endlessly.</p>

    <p>But there is a unified point of view.</p>

    <p>That's what these historians still believe.</p>

    <p>The descendants of Dragon's creator must still be in this world.</p>

    <p>The beautiful splendid lights and the beautiful water spray continuously spit out from the copper faucet combined with classical music form a fine seven-color water mist in the air. It seems to give people the illusion of being in a fantasyland.</p>

    <p>Countless water columns tower into the clouds. Sometimes they are domineering and majestic, sometimes they are graceful and graceful, sometimes they are lively and lively, and sometimes they sound like loud bells.</p>

    <p>All kinds of changes make the onlookers excited.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the lovers beside the fountain hugged each other. Everyone became silent and silently watched the fountain show in front of them.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked around. Suddenly he found that the situation seemed a bit awkward.</p>

    <p>Right next to her, the lovers were almost hugging each other. Jiugong Liangzi's face darkened.</p>

    <p>It's just a fountain... is it necessary? We're not on the Titanic!</p>

    <p>If you want to nibble, why don't you go to bed and nibble! Hmph!</p>

    <p>"You look.</p>

    <p>You don't seem too happy? Do you want a hug?" At this time, the voice of Zhuo Yi came.</p>

    <p>"How can I be unhappy..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "And! You are clearly behind me! How could you see my expression!"</p>

    <p>"You can tell it from the breath." Zhuo Yi said: "This is the benefit of having a high level of cultivation."</p>

    <p>"Don't be too proud, old liar. I still doubt you now," the girl said.</p>

    <p>"It took six years to practice to achieve my level of combat power. Do you think it is possible?" Zhuo Yi smiled. The expression on his face was very relaxed.</p>

    <p>"What if there is an adventure? Who knows."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi pouted and hummed.</p>

    <p>"So now. Are you avoiding my question?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"What's the problem?" Jiugong Liangzi pretended not to know.</p>

    <p>"I just asked you. Do you want... a hug?" Zhuo Yi took a step forward.</p>

    <p>"Don't move..."</p>

    <p>Feeling the breath of Zhuo Yi coming closer to her, Jiugong Liangzi panicked for a moment. She blushed and warned in her own way: "You are not allowed to come close to me! I will really be angry!"</p>

    <p>"Okay. I understand."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi takes a step back. Raise your hands in surrender.</p>

    <p>Hey... As expected of Liangzi...</p>

    <p>Even when he's angry, he's so cute...</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, you can't eat hot tofu in a hurry. Zhuo Yi still has enough patience on this point.</p>

    <p>It's been mentioned before.</p>

    <p>"Relaxation and relaxation." This is Zhuo Yi's first love rule for Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi turned his eyes to the other side.</p>

    <p>But I saw Wang Ling still had her eyes closed. I was shocked for a while.</p>

    <p>This wish may be a little too long...</p>

    <p>But soon Zhuo Yi realized what happened.</p>

    <p>It must be because all the couples around him were hugging each other. This put Master in an embarrassing situation.</p>

    <p>And the worst thing is...</p>

    <p>Even Sun Rong seemed to be surrounded by the crowd.</p>

    <p>The two people are actually not that far apart. However, there are lovers in front, behind, left and right. They are firmly sandwiched in the middle like a chess set.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Guo Hao, Chen Chao and Li Youyue, although they retreated in time, left space for the two of them.</p>

    <p>But he underestimated the number of couples around Dragon.</p>

    <p>"The situation doesn't seem good. We need to think of a way..."</p>

    <p>This time he came to the ancient street. Mainly because he was ordered by Wang Ling to help rescue the siege.</p>

    <p>Although he is "teasing" Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>However, he still did not forget the tasks assigned to him by his master.</p>

    <p>I can only go through it first...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi himself is not afraid of embarrassment.</p>

    <p>Then he took a step and took the initiative to walk in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Feeling Zhuo Yi's breath become distant. Jiugong Liangzi asked hurriedly: "Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>"Ah. I'm going to the bathroom. Do you want to follow me?"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to follow you..." The girl snorted.</p>

    <p>She glanced sideways at the direction Zhuo Yi left with her peripheral vision. An intuition told her that things didn't seem that simple.</p>

    <p>So. Do you want to go there and have a look?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is struggling.</p>

    <p>She spent about three seconds thinking about it. Finally she took a step.</p>

    <p>Snort...</p>

    <p>This guy is going somewhere. It certainly has nothing to do with her!</p>

    <p>But as an employer, it is normal behavior to supervise the work of bodyguards, right?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, the girl seemed to have gained some confidence and began to move forward bravely.</p>

    <p>Walk firmly and confidently...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Miss Sun, who was trapped in a couple, was troubled by the situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>As soon as the fountain show started, the nearby lovers all swarmed up and came closer in order to have a clearer view. She and Wang Ling were immediately separated.</p>

    <p>She is now surrounded by lovers. Although she can feel the aura of Wang Ling not far away from her... the situation is still very awkward.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the couples around her are almost hugging their faces and starting to eat each other!</p>

    <p>The impact of this kind of picture is undoubtedly devastating to a girl who is in unrequited love...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that there is no way she would choose this time to disturb others. It would be too rude.</p>

    <p>"Sorry, please give way." At this time, a familiar voice came.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong seemed to hear the voice of the savior...</p>

    <p>She saw Zhuo Yi coming towards her. And she was greeting the couple in front of her who was holding each other's necks and biting each other.</p>

    <p>The couple was disturbed. They looked very unhappy. The man was very big and had tattoos on his arms. He looked unhappy: "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I just wanted to borrow it for a while. My school girl got separated inside..." Zhuo Yi said politely.</p>

    <p>"College style role play. It's kind of interesting."</p>

    <p>The tattooed man chuckled and said, "Where did you find this student? Can you introduce me to him?"</p>

    <p>"Don't you already have a girlfriend?" Zhuo Yi frowned. Feeling a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just him. People nearby stopped what they were talking about when they heard the tattooed man's words. They all turned their attention here.</p>

    <p>This is too scumbag...</p>

    <p>"It's all between you and me. It's just for fun. My partner never minds."</p>

    <p>As he said that, the tattooed man lifted his girlfriend's chin. There was a fierce look in his eyes: "Really? Hmm?"</p>

    <p>"eh..." The girl lowered her head, not daring to look directly into the tattooed man's eyes.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi clearly felt that she was scared.</p>

    <p>Maybe even becoming a girlfriend... was unilaterally coerced by the other party?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has no evidence for this. He can't control it. But the man in front of him is really hateful.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it is not convenient for Zhuo Yi to do it now in a public place.</p>

    <p>After all, he still has the status of a government official...</p>

    <p>Although the other party is hateful, if someone were to do something here and someone filmed it and posted it on the Internet, there might be some trouble.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. Could you please lend me a moment..." At this moment, he heard the voice of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Because of the intervention of Zhuo Yi, the surrounding couples stopped working and turned their attention to eating melon here.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly seized the opportunity and went around to Zhuo Yi from the other direction.</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiUnexpectedly, the goal was achieved like this...</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to go over and pull the girl out, but unexpectedly, he indirectly rescued her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard what the tattooed man said before.</p>

    <p>As a girl, of course she was also very unhappy. She stared at the tattooed man and tried hard to restrain the sword energy that was about to emerge from her body: "You'd better correct your attitude!"</p>

    <p>"What? Is this the school girl you are talking about?"</p>

    <p>The tattooed man was happy. Looking at Zhuo Yi: "He looks good. He looks like an idol star? How much does it cost per night?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, many people nearby felt angry.</p>

    <p>Many boys in the crowd had already rolled up their sleeves, looking like they were about to attack.</p>

    <p>Then, he sat down on a bald copper dragon head and sneered: "Today, I will sit here. I want to see who dares to do something to me."</p>

    <p>The tattooed man had a arrogant attitude. While sitting, he pulled his girlfriend and held her tightly with one arm.</p>

    <p>That seemed to be a threat. Many young people who wanted to step forward to hit him hesitated.</p>

    <p>They were worried that if they pushed too hard, this scumbag might hurt the girl.</p>

    <p>"This arrogance is really too arrogant..."</p>

    <p>"That's too much. That girl must have been coerced. Do you want to call the police?"</p>

    <p>"But they haven't done anything now. It's useless to call the police, right?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. Is there no one who can punish this scumbag?"</p>

    <p>The girls around were also very angry. Then they closed their eyes and began to make wishes to Dragon.</p>

    <p>"Ya!"</p>

    <p>Then. Just the next moment.</p>

    <p>The tattooed man let out a painful scream like a slaughtering pig...</p>

    <p>What's going on?!</p>

    <p>The girls who were making wishes opened their eyes one after another.</p>

    <p>I saw the originally proud tattooed man covering his buttocks and falling in front of Dragon.</p>

    <p>Two bloody holes were poked out of his buttocks by the dragon's head...</p>

    <p>What the fuck!?</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes were horrified.</p>

    <p>The dragon head that was originally bald actually grew horns again...</p>

    <p>"It must have been done by classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong understood something in her heart instantly. She smiled and felt very relaxed instantly.</p>

    <p>You are worthy of being a master...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help laughing either.</p>

    <p>Then he gently tugged at the corner of Sun Rong's Hanfu. He whispered: "Sun Rong, schoolgirl. There are too many people here. Master has gone out. It seems that he has something to give you."</p>

    <p>"Ah... Wang Ling. He. Wants to give me a gift?" The girl showed a surprised expression.</p>

    <p>"You'll know when you go out and take a look. Let's go." Zhuo Yi smiled. Then she took the girl's hand and planned to lead her to where Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jiugong Liangzi look at it clearly.</p>
