  <h1>Chapter 1359 Another Buddhist sage?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Why are there elephant specimens in the hospital...</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian's face darkened. The next moment he began to struggle.</p>

    <p>At this time, if you choose nothing, then both the golden and silver eggs will be his.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. If these two things are hanging down, how can he walk!</p>

    <p>Even if you can walk! It's easy to get pulled!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Zhao Qingxian was in a dilemma.</p>

    <p>Because if he chooses to lie or chooses not to accept it, he will be severely punished by the river god.</p>

    <p>So Zhao Qingxian sighed and had no choice but to tell the truth: "Lord River God, these are not mine... My original intention is..."</p>

    <p>"You don't need to explain any more."</p>

    <p>The handsome river god with red and phoenix eyes has already seen through Zhao Qingxian's heart.</p>

    <p>He had a cold look on his face. He threw the golden and silver eggs in his hands into the river. Then he looked at Zhao Qingxian and said with the aura of a boss: "The rules. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"{Tian Yuan Gui Xin Dan}!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian gritted his teeth. He took out two pills unceremoniously: "These are my tributes to Lord River God!"</p>

    <p>"Two coins for two coins? Ha. You know what's going on."</p>

    <p>The River God raised his finger and swept away the two pills: "According to the law of equivalent transactions, the part you lost is actually irreversible. So, when I return the thing to you, you will also have another part of your body. It disappears randomly. But don't worry. The disappeared parts will not affect your life."</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian didn't expect that he would be in such a situation after losing two pills.</p>

    <p>He wanted to ask the River God to return the elixir to him. However, the River God's expression quickly turned cold: "Hmm? Do you want to regret it? The consequences of regretting it are very serious."</p>

    <p>"I..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian knew that he had no other choice: "Okay! I just have one request. I hope Lord River God won't make me bald... other parts. If I lose a finger or something, that's no problem."</p>

    <p>"You think so."</p>

    <p>River God hehe: "However, according to the principle of equivalent exchange, the disappearing parts are random. Even I can't control it. Just ask for your own blessings."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the aura on the River God suddenly turned aside.</p>

    <p>A wonderful sense of supremacy emanated from him.</p>

    <p>Mysterious and mysterious. The gate of all mysteries...</p>

    <p>All kinds of illusions arise...</p>

    <p>Feeling the power of the Heavenly Dao River God up close, Zhao Qingxian felt that the whole world seemed to be quiet at this moment.</p>

    <p>In fact, every transaction with Heavenly Dao, the river god, is also a great opportunity to experience the laws of Heavenly Dao up close.</p>

    <p>However, the time of this feeling is too short. It always leaves people with a feeling of unfinished learning.</p>

    <p>"Transaction completed."</p>

    <p>After about tens of seconds, the river god reopened his phoenix eyes.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "Did it succeed?"</p>

    <p>The river god nodded: "Succeeded."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian opened his pants excitedly and took a look...</p>

    <p>.</p>

    <p>The next moment, his whole body felt like a thunderbolt. He was extremely shocked by the scene in front of him: "Lord River God!!!"</p>

    <p>The river god raised his eyebrows: "What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian roared: "You put the eggs back. Take away my fried dough sticks!!! What's the use!!!"</p>

    <p>The river god smiled: "From now on, you will be the new old man."</p>

    <p>After saying this, his whole body turned into a puddle of clear water and melted into the river. Only Zhao Qingxian was left alone on the river bank, messy in the wind.</p>

    <p>"Why. Why was I so unlucky after coming to earth..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know how much time passed. Zhao Qingxian squatted down from the river bank with his head in his hands.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was painful. Full of the breakdown of an adult.</p>

    <p>All this is actually just as the monk said at the beginning.</p>

    <p>As a cultivator in the Divine Realm, life in the Divine Realm is too comfortable now. In order to make the cultivation path of the younger generations more stable, the parents have laid various roads for the younger generations of the family in advance.</p>

    <p>I was afraid that these family members would fall down on the road.</p>

    <p>And an overly comfortable life has also made these cultivators who have come out of the divine realm become mentally fragile...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi have all suffered losses before.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, they are growing very quickly.</p>

    <p>The hardships on the earth have made their hearts stronger, their spirits tougher, and their dealings smoother...</p>

    <p>These growths are not what Zhao Qingxian currently possesses.</p>

    <p>"Is it painful?"</p>

    <p>At this time, a figure appeared behind Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>This man was wearing a black cloak. He had a neat black haircut and sword-shaped eyebrows. He looked like a man from a comic book.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian didn't know this man.</p>

    <p>But this man seemed to know him. And he seemed to know everything about him.</p>

    <p>The man stretched out his hand. Zhao Qingxian was stunned when he saw this hand as white as jade with distinct finger bones.</p>

    <p>He couldn't imagine that a man's hands could be so delicate.</p>

    <p>The other party stretched out his finger and gently touched his forehead.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Zhao Qingxian suddenly felt that his missing part had returned...</p>

    <p>"This..." He was surprised in his heart.</p>

    <p>"It's just an illusion that exists and doesn't exist." The man laughed.</p>

    <p>"Senior!" Zhao Qingxian knelt down</p>

    <p>"You're welcome."</p>

    <p>The man helped Zhao Qingxian up. He was extremely gentle: "My name is Yang Shuangji. You can also call me Mr. Shuangji."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Shuangji..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian chewed the name carefully. At the same time, the expression on his face was extremely surprised: "Mr. Shuangji and I have never met. I don't know why Mr. Shuangji wants to help me?"</p>

    <p>"The pain of life is just a matter of effort." The man named Shuangji smiled.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhao Qingxian noticed that there was a string of Buddhist beads hanging around the man's neck. Each beads was as big as a walnut. This gave Zhao Qingxian a sense of déjà vu.</p>

    <p>Just because of the lines on it, Zhao Qingxian seems to be somewhere...</p>

    <p>Seems like I've seen it before.</p>

    <p>"Acting against nature. Do you know your sin..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, on the originally calm river, serious voices sounded like phantom sounds on the Dao.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian felt a harsh sound. He was about to kneel down on the ground. But Mr. Shuangji next to him gently tapped his ear again, and the force was easily dissipated.</p>

    <p>The handsome Heavenly Dao River God who had disappeared before reappeared. He stared at the man who suddenly appeared in front of him with a pair of phoenix eyes.</p>

    <p>Obviously, he was dissatisfied with Mr. Shuangji's meddling behavior.</p>

    <p>"If you have the ability, you can defy heaven. I don't know what crime you are guilty of?" Mr. Shuangji took a step forward, with golden light surrounding his body.</p>

    <p>"The most holy one in Buddhism?" Heavenly Dao River God was extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>"Lord River God, please step back. You are no match for me."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji stood in front of Zhao Qingxian: "I am destined to this person. So I will protect him."</p>

    <p>"You have broken the laws of Heavenly Dao. As the River God, how can I spare you..." The Phoenix-Eyed River God was furious. His voice was indifferent and had a powerful majesty.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the river began to boil. The laws of the great avenues intertwined and began to flow out.</p>

    <p>"Don't overestimate your capabilities..." Yang Shuangji shook his head.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>He clasped his hands together. A golden Buddha light shot out from his hands.</p>

    <p>Before the river god could fully become angry, it penetrated the skull of the phoenix-eyed river god.</p>

    <p>The Buddha's light crashed into the body of the river god. With astonishing energy, the Heavenly Dao river god was shattered on the spot and evaporated instantly...</p>
