  <h1>Chapter 2069 The stormy waters of Daxiling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Although the triangular maritime restricted area in the Great Xiling Sea is something that major cultivating countries will not easily get involved in, it is not easy to go directly to that restricted area.</p>

    <p>Because there are many small Xiu Zhen countries on the way to the sea restricted area. And each of the small Xiu Zhen countries has its own territorial waters.</p>

    <p>After all, in the eyes of most modern cultivators, going to that dangerous zone recognized by the cultivation world is a pure act of seeking death.</p>

    <p>If the explanation is really revealed, who are you? Which of the surrounding cultivating countries will be responsible for this matter? It will really become an unclear matter.</p>

    <p>After all, in the long history of cultivation, there have been many incidents where the surrounding small cultivation countries were violated.</p>

    <p>So usually there are two ways to go along this road.</p>

    <p>The first is to obtain the customs registration of the respective cultivating countries. Obtain the international pass to the restricted sea area. This filing will be automatically entered into the International Federation of Cultivators as a notarization.</p>

    <p>To put it simply, this is an international certificate of life and death personally signed by one's own country of cultivation. This means that if this person has this international pass, if something really happens in the restricted area of the sea, he will not be able to communicate with other surrounding cultivators. There is no relationship between the two countries. This directly eliminates the possibility of conflict.</p>

    <p>The second method is to go directly to the free route. On the free route, you can perfectly avoid neighboring countries and will not cause any international disputes. The only disadvantage is that the route is very long and will take many unnecessary detours.</p>

    <p>For many monks who rush to the restricted sea area to die because of their strong curiosity, the unit time seems not so cost-effective. Moreover, there may be many other problems encountered on the free route. For example, pirate robbery, Attacks by Neptune-like spiritual beasts, extreme weather leading to yaw, and other unpredictable disasters...</p>

    <p>Once you get into trouble, your supplies may soon be exhausted. You may be out of breath before you even enter the restricted area.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This is a rare mission that Zhang Zhui performs alone. In many previous missions assigned by Lord Diulei, he has always partnered with Li Xian to perform tasks together.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui was not used to going on missions alone.</p>

    <p>As for Li Xian, he was unable to go to the restricted sea area with Zhang Zhui this time to find the missing general Maiko Assi. The main reason was that Li Xian's unique research on meteorites could just assist Lord Diulei in carrying out those extraterrestrial missions in recent years. Investigation of meteorites.</p>

    <p>Songhai Customs Registration Office.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui submitted all his information. As an Eternal, his identity information has already been entered into the Huaxiu Citizen System. It was obtained with the help of Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi, giving him legal status in modern life. identity.</p>

    <p>Everything was going smoothly at first. However, he got stuck in the final review process.</p>

    <p>A total of three audits are required to issue an international pass. The first two auditors are Chinese from Huaxiu. The last auditor is sent from the International Association of Cultivators and will be changed from time to time to ensure the fairness of the audit.</p>

    <p>But irregular changes mean that each auditor has a different temperament. Like the one Zhang Zhui met now, he is particularly serious.</p>

    <p>"Your occupation is an anti-pocketing consultant. If you don't guide anti-pocketing work, why are you going to the sea area?" The auditor grabbed the stamp in his hand. Obviously he only needed to stamp it. But in the end, he was stunned. It became a cross-examination.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed silently. He was actually very annoyed by such nosy aspects. But this was the last step. He had to be patient and said: "I'm sorry, fellow Taoist. I feel like this is my privacy."</p>

    <p>"Regardless of whether you keep it private or not, you always have to ask clearly for the reason. I see that the reasons are empty. This is against the rules."</p>

    <p>"Because it's not required."</p>

    <p>"But I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. I just want to fill in the blank."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed helplessly and said: "Someone stole my things and hid in the restricted area. So I have to find him."</p>

    <p>"You, a consultant of the anti-pocketing team, have your things stolen? Your profession is also fake, right?" Auditor Number 3 stared at Zhang Zhui and said suspiciously.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Zhang Zhui actually had some guilty conscience. But he was also an old man. He didn't show it directly. He just smiled.</p>

    <p>As a result, this person still refused to give up: "The photo on your profile. Is that you?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "It was me. At that time, I was still very white."</p>

    <p>"But let me tell you, this is not you. You should know that photos that have been beautified with a beauty camera cannot be used for international materials according to regulations." The Number 3 auditor smiled evilly and immediately turned to Zhang Zhui. Stretch out a hand. Open your palm.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui is not completely ignorant of the ways of the world. As soon as this action came out, he seemed to know the man's intention. He smiled coldly and pretended to be confused: "So, what do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Do you really not understand? Or are you pretending not to understand?"</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I don't want to understand."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui rolled his eyes and didn't bother to talk to this person anymore.</p>

    <p>This was the first time he had seen such a blatant request. Of course, it was not Zhang Zhui who was stingy. How could he not understand this person's sophistication? He just simply felt that this person deserved a beating. He just didn't want to follow this person's wishes.</p>

    <p>If the international pass application cannot be approved, then for Zhang Zhui, there is only one way left - free flight.</p>

    <p>Although for many modern monks, the journey of the free route is much longer than that of following the normal process. Moreover, various uncertain accidents are prone to occur on the road.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui still has confidence. He is an eternal man. What kind of scene has he not seen?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So just a few days later, Zhang Zhui arrived at the sea restricted area almost at the same time as Yi Jianchuan and Wang Muyu. Zhang Zhui did not encounter any major risks along the way. The main problem was that he did not know the way and deviated several times. It was only because of the delay that we missed the original route.</p>

    <p>At the mouth of the sea that officially leads to the restricted area, there is a small floating island called Yama Island.</p>

    <p>Many monks will organize themselves on the island before choosing to enter the restricted sea area.</p>

    <p>But when Zhang Zhui came here today, this small island was so crowded that he was completely confused.</p>

    <p>This year, there are so many monks who choose to go to the sea restricted area to commit suicide?</p>

    <p>"Fellow Taoist, what happened? The people gathered here seem to be a little out of character..." He stopped one person and asked, and then gave him a bag of spiritual stones as a thank you. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>He got this from this person when he was questioning him. Then he replaced the outer skin with lightning speed. The young monk was careless about taking precautions and did not check carefully. He went straight to Zhang Zhui. Of course.</p>

    <p>When he saw Zhang Zhui taking the initiative to offer him a favor, he said happily with a face full of joy: "Fellow Taoist, you don't know. Most of the people who come to the island now are here to join in the fun."</p>

    <p>"Joining in on the fun?"</p>

    <p>"Don't know? There are rumors that the famous Sword Master of the Huaxiu Kingdom has accepted a disciple. He also plans to take the disciple to the sea restricted area. Everyone came after hearing the news. They all want to see Sword Master Yi and him. The true face of my apprentice."</p>

    <p>While introducing the situation to Zhang Zhui, the man smiled and said: "The signal here is poor. If you open the circle of friends now, you will know. In the circle of friends now, half of the people are in Universal Studios, and the other half are in the circle of friends." On this Yama Island."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "..."</p>
