  <h1>Chapter 1687 Making milk powder for my sister</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The most important and unique ability of the Chaos Helm is that it can instantly attach all attacks to a specific invisible "antenna", thereby allowing remote control of the attacks.</p>

    <p>Whether it is Heavenly Dao spells, ordinary spells, magic weapons, or attacks from spiritual swords, all can be controlled by the Chaos Helm.</p>

    <p>However, this palm force was used by him to twist the rudder and change the original trajectory to attack Wang Nuan. The man who suddenly appeared just breathed out and changed the trajectory he had set again.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it doubled back with 1000% power. At this moment, it was a little beyond Master Wu Xin's understanding.</p>

    <p>This man doesn't have a rudder...</p>

    <p>Why can the trajectory of a spell be changed?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Master Wu Xin's brain was a little confused. He once again used the rudder to change the trajectory that Wang Ling turned back. In the end, after passing through the Buddha Palm twice, it became over a thousand times stronger than before. It blasted into the distance with twice the power.</p>

    <p>In the distance, a huge mushroom cloud rose from the ground, illuminating the entire supreme world. The sky was shaken out of a hole by this palm. Countless stars hung down from the hole, shedding a ray of light with the terrifying power of chaos.</p>

    <p>These rays of light are extremely soft and beautiful. But if anyone in the ancestral realm reaches out and touches them easily, they will be burned to ashes immediately.</p>

    <p>Facing such a scene, everyone here couldn't help but feel in awe.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling and Wang Nuan remained unmoved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was not afraid of this in the first place.</p>

    <p>Besides, the scene in front of me is not a big scene.</p>

    <p>Even though Master Wu Xin is a very powerful Eternal One, in fact, in Wang Ling's view, his combat power may not be as strong as Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>When he picked up Wang Nuan, the only thing that felt like something was wrong was that Ah Nuan was hungry.</p>

    <p>No matter how poor you are, you can't be poor in education, and you can't starve your sister. Ah Nuan girl is growing her body, so she definitely needs to keep up with her nutrition.</p>

    <p>So how to fill Ah Nuan girl's belly has become Wang Ling's first problem right now.</p>

    <p>Compared with Fenmu Shen last time, there are not so many tentacle monsters here that can be used as ingredients for grilled squid. And the Master Wu Xin is a mechanized cultivator. The body is nothing but motor oil and gears ...... It is not possible to feed these things to your own sister.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, Wang Ling is a little resourceful and he reacts very quickly.</p>

    <p>He immediately saw in the distance, those by the Buddha God palm broken space, from the gap this flow of star power infused with the power of the chaos of the sunlight ......</p>

    <p>These rays of light cannot be touched by ordinary people.</p>

    <p>But they siblings can.</p>

    <p>It is also an excellent material for making "milk powder."</p>

    <p>It contains huge chaos energy. It is definitely enough to replenish Ah Nuan girl's physical strength.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the whole place was silent. It could be said that there was no one around.</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes are fixed on the movement over Wang Ling. They don't know what Wang Ling plans to do next.</p>

    <p>After all, with a normal person's brain circuit, they would never imagine that this kind of deadly chaotic glow can be used to make milk powder and make milk for Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>I only saw the next second. Wang Ling opened the pupil power of King's Eyes. He took all the rays of light into his own King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren... what is he doing? Using King's Eyes to collect the chaotic glow?" Xiang Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Maybe he is holding back his ultimate move. After all, he is Little Master Lingzi. His thinking is beyond our understanding." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"Is it possible that it has other uses?" At this time, Qin Zhong asked again.</p>

    <p>At this moment, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception is talking. They don't understand what the meaning of Wang Ling's move is.</p>

    <p>I also don't understand the meaning of containing the chaotic rays of light in King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>After all, if it were a shock wave initiated by King's Eyes, the destructive power of wiping out everything within sight would be much scarier than the chaotic glow!</p>

    <p>Therefore, there is no need to rely on this method of accumulating energy to increase pupil power.</p>

    <p>"Could it be that master has developed some new magic?" Zhuo Yi was full of expectations.</p>

    <p>After all, today's opponents are different from those in the past. Those opponents in the past were all limited to the scope of the earth. They could be solved with a slap.</p>

    <p>But now, these opponents are all cosmic-level figures. They are either born from chaos, or they are otherworldly eternal beings.</p>

    <p>A slap cannot be repaired, but fancy slapping can still be continued.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels that since encountering a cosmic-level opponent, Wang Ling's tricks have basically never been repeated.</p>

    <p>Every time you meet someone face to face with Wang Ling, you will have different new discoveries and experiences.</p>

    <p>Then, with these new discoveries and new experiences, I either stopped thinking forever or became dust in the universe.</p>

    <p>"Ya!"</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl is lying on Wang Ling's shoulder. She looks like she is so hungry that her chest is touching her back. She looks like a soft and glutinous cake.</p>

    <p>"It'll be fine soon." Wang Ling soothed in a soft voice.</p>

    <p>There was still not much expression on his face. But the gentleness that he naturally exuded when he treated his sister still deeply touched Sun Rong's eyes.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong was clearly in the core world, but there was a hint of jealousy in her heart.</p>

    <p>She knew clearly that this kind of behavior was very childish, but she still couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is killing her ...</p>

    <p>Sometimes. Sun Rong can't tell whether the wood is real wood or fake wood.</p>

    <p>He will always inadvertently show some unexpected behavior that is completely different from his usual style. And this behavior is very natural. Especially when getting along with Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>As a result, she also began to reflect for a while in the core world.</p>

    <p>I think there might be something special about Ah Nuan girl that Wang Ling likes?</p>

    <p>Previously. Sun Rong heard from Father Wang and Mother Wang. In the future, Ah Nuan girl will also go to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>So in other words.</p>

    <p>She can actually be counted as the senior sister of Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong feels that it is necessary for her to personally come to the Wang family villa as a senior to communicate, visit and learn, so as to enhance the relationship with Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>Although it seems shameful to pin one's lifelong happiness on a little girl. But now Sun Rong can't care so much anymore. As long as it is useful.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was thinking wildly.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling frowned and began to focus on the Chaos Rudder in Master Wu Xin's hand.</p>

    <p>Making milk powder is one thing.</p>

    <p>But after all, it is a milk powder made from Chaotic Light, so the bottle that can contain it may have to meet certain standards.</p>

    <p>Ordinary baby bottles. Even if they are modified by themselves, they are still not strong enough. Ah Nuan girl might break it while drinking.</p>

    <p>It would be bad if the little girl gets burned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he has never been so considerate. He actually thinks hard about making milk powder for his sister.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Mother Wang never deceived him.</p>

    <p>Preparing milk powder is really a profound knowledge!</p>

    <p>So now, he focused all his thoughts on the chaos rudder.</p>

    <p>Because.</p>

    <p>This is an excellent material for making baby bottles...</p>
