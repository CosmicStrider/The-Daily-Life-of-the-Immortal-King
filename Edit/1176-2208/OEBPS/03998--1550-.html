  <h1>Chapter 1550 The Tomb Keeper of the Heavenly Tomb</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment her head was clasped by this pitch-black claw, the old woman felt her brain was congested and her lips trembled.</p>

    <p>She was calm on the surface, but she was extremely frightened inside.</p>

    <p>Although I had already anticipated the strength of the person in front of me, I never thought that the other person would be so strong.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the gap between strengths can often be reflected in simple details.</p>

    <p>The divine light called "The Weak Retreat" that Fenmu Shen shot split apart her sea of holy flames in an instant. It also rushed towards her at a speed invisible to the naked eye and grabbed her head.</p>

    <p>"Although I had expected that the old guy would definitely send someone to guard the tomb, I didn't expect that the person sent to guard the tomb would be such a miserable little woman." Fenmu Shen said.</p>

    <p>With his current combat power, he wouldn't panic at all even if he encountered a monster.</p>

    <p>But the old woman in front of him was far inferior to Xie in terms of combat power.</p>

    <p>"I know I am no match for you. But there are mountains outside the mountains. I advise you to understand." The old woman sneered, but she was neither humble nor arrogant.</p>

    <p>"Of course I understand this truth, but you don't know. I have always been a mountain outside the mountain..." Fenmu Shen sighed. He couldn't help but laugh: "Wait until I get back the other half of the tomb. Soul. Kill that boy on earth again. There will be no more trouble in this universe."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the hand he held in the old woman's hand suddenly rumbled. Endless dark and chaotic light was released from his palm.</p>

    <p>It was poured down directly from the top of the old woman's head. It contained strong spiritual energy and the power of rules. It demonstrated Fenmu Shen's powerful power. It was otherworldly and surprising.</p>

    <p>The old woman was filled with this black light. She was like a chicken being held up. She had no strength left to resist.</p>

    <p>Her body expanded like a balloon.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>Turned into a ball of flying ash!</p>

    <p>Under the powerful outpouring of energy, the old woman didn't even cry out.</p>

    <p>"Too weak. Vulnerable." Fenmu Shen stopped.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that the guardians of the Sky Tomb would not be too weak.</p>

    <p>The result is just a fool who shows off his power by relying on a few chaos weapons in his hand.</p>

    <p>Eternal-level characters. Who hasn't got a few precious chaos weapons in their hands?</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen still has quite a few collections of his own.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that as the guardian of the Sky Tomb, he could at least be forced to sacrifice a Chaos Weapon to show respect.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly. This old woman is too weak.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the place where the old woman disappeared. The expression on his face was neither sad nor happy. He turned around and walked towards the place where the old woman had just appeared.</p>

    <p>The old woman just stepped out of the space rift opened by Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And this spatial rift, Fenmu Shen thinks, is the passage connecting the celestial tomb.</p>

    <p>The specific coordinates. He has completely memorized them.</p>

    <p>"Old guy, you didn't expect... In the end, you buried me and sealed me here. In the end, I still dug your coffin with my own hands..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen stretched out his sharp claws.</p>

    <p>He possesses unparalleled power. He pierces directly into the void and forcibly opens up the space at that coordinate position!</p>

    <p>Suddenly the nearby space shook. Thunder roared. Powerful psychic energy fluctuations spread out with Fenmu Shen as the center. Divine light shot into the sky. The scene was horrifying.</p>

    <p>Such an amazing scene. Any viewer would definitely exclaim that the end is coming.</p>

    <p>As for Fenmu Shen himself, it seemed like he had done something ordinary.</p>

    <p>His expression was calm. No matter how terrifying the scene nearby was, there was no fluctuation.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds of clawing at the cracks, Fenmu Shen's pupils finally shook slightly: "It's done."</p>

    <p>The closed crack in the sky tomb was opened again, giving Fenmu Shen a surprise that his long-cherished wish had finally come true.</p>

    <p>However, just as he was about to lean out, a pair of old hands stretched out from the crack again and grabbed his claws.</p>

    <p>"Eh?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was surprised.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, there is someone in the tomb today.</p>

    <p>And this person is no one else.</p>

    <p>It was the old woman with the lantern whom I had destroyed before...</p>

    <p>"You are still alive?" Fenmu Shen found it incredible.</p>

    <p>Under the previous initiation of that kind of power, he was sure that the old woman was dead.</p>

    <p>And during the whole process, his evil eyes were carefully observing to ensure that the old woman he caught was the real person, not a stand-in or an illusion.</p>

    <p>But now, the old woman with the lantern who appeared in front of him again was exactly the same as the one he killed before.</p>

    <p>No matter it's the expression, posture, clothing, appearance or the movement of holding the lantern.</p>

    <p>Everything looks like a replica. It's exactly the same.</p>

    <p>"You take it for granted. Entering the Dao Ancestor Sky Tomb is not that easy."</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern laughed and said: "Although I can't beat you, you can't do anything to me. Even if you risk your life and block the entrance of this passage, it doesn't matter. Let's see who can outlast the other."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen frowned.</p>

    <p>He was so angry at the old woman's words that he was trembling all over.</p>

    <p>"I don't believe that I can't kill you..."</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a breath as vast as the ocean came overwhelmingly.</p>

    <p>It was like a storm blowing, making people's face tremble.</p>

    <p>The old woman's figure was almost unstable, but her lantern was as steady as a rock in the strong wind. She didn't even move.</p>

    <p>"The weak retreat!"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen repeats his old tricks.</p>

    <p>This time, he opened his five fingers. On his fingertips, there were five rays of God's light like five sharp swords. He stabbed the old woman's head, chest and other vital parts again!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The old woman's body exploded on the spot. It was torn apart!</p>

    <p>This time, he added a little bit of incantation to his move, which can cause the person hit to be destroyed physically and mentally, without reincarnation. It can effectively limit 99% of resurrection spells!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen felt that this old woman could be resurrected. She must have used some method to resurrect herself, or a magic weapon or prop for death.</p>

    <p>However, not long after the old woman holding the lamp exploded.</p>

    <p>From the rift in space, another identical old woman came out holding a lantern...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was surprised.</p>

    <p>He thought to himself: Could this old woman have multiple twins?</p>

    <p>There is a popular type of girl these days. The heroine is one who has multiple children.</p>

    <p>For example {One Pregnancy and Six Treasures: The Overbearing President Knocks on the Door}.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of him just reminded Fenmu Shen of this category.</p>

    <p>He looked at the old woman who was constantly resurrected. He couldn't help but start to think of the title of the book {One Child, a Thousand Treasures: Giving birth to an old woman to carry the lantern}...</p>

    <p>This old woman couldn't possibly have jumped out of a rock, right?</p>

    <p>"What? Are you feeling hopeless now?"</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern smiled: "There are many people who want to kill me. But there are almost no people who can actually kill me."</p>

    <p>"Are you inhuman?" Fenmu Shen was also confused.</p>

    <p>He glanced up and down at the tombkeeper in front of him with his evil eyes.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he figured out something...</p>

    <p>That's the way to really kill the old woman. Maybe you can't start directly with the old woman's body!</p>

    <p>The real body should be this old woman's lantern!</p>

    <p>Every time, this old woman comes out carrying a lantern...</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen stared at the old woman holding the lantern and cursed in her heart.</p>

    <p>He thought of a way beyond resurrection.</p>

    <p>And it is not within the scope of 99% of the resurrection spells that you have limited.</p>

    <p>It was also a spell that Dao Ancestor Wang was developing but had not yet officially launched.</p>

    <p>As an old rival of Dao Ancestor Wang, Fenmu Shen should know something about it.</p>

    <p>Now that so many years have passed, it is not surprising that this trick has been developed.</p>

    <p>"Did that old guy pass on the method of the Immortal Grip to you?" At this time, Fenmu Shen asked.</p>
