  <h1>Chapter 1264 That man is here again!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Songhai City. Qixing First Military Medical Hospital.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Boss Sun are having secret talks.</p>

    <p>After the Void Invasion incident, the relationship between the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception became closer.</p>

    <p>"Have you ever seen the clues about my granddaughter with your true master's strength?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun asked with great hope: "The True Lord is already the number one True Venerated Immortal in the world. His strength is extraordinary. If the True Lord is helpless... I really can't think of anyone else who can help me."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>With his little strength, he probably wouldn't be able to survive even two slaps in front of his brother-in-law.</p>

    <p>No. Two palms are too much.</p>

    <p>Just a slap...</p>

    <p>However, he has an agreement with Wang Ling. His identity will never be revealed.</p>

    <p>So in front of Sun Yiyuan, he will not mention anything about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In Lord Diulei's view, Sun Rong can definitely get better. Even if someone casts a curse on Sun Rong, the person standing behind Sun Rong now is the strongest man in the universe.</p>

    <p>"Ms. Sun's symptoms are indeed strange. I didn't notice anything unusual." Faced with the question, Lord Diulei shook his head slightly.</p>

    <p>Before he decided to meet Sun Yiyuan, he had already used the King's Eyes of Wang Ling to investigate.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes didn't find anything unusual. He even used the ability to cleanse his eyes.</p>

    <p>If it is really a curse, there is no spell in the world that can avoid the purification effect of the eyes.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had already seen the power of the Pure Eye when Keorn was captured by the First Prison of Songhai.</p>

    <p>Seven True Immortal levels of curse power were completely disintegrated in an instant.</p>

    <p>"Then it seems that for the present plan, we have to turn a dead horse into a living doctor..." Mr. Boss Sun's brows furrowed tightly.</p>

    <p>He thought of the "Master Jin Deng" recommended to him by Dr. Liu Min. But he didn't know whether this person was reliable or not.</p>

    <p>"Have you ever heard of a Zen master named Jin Deng?" At this time, Mr. Boss Sun asked.</p>

    <p>"Never heard of it." Lord Diulei shook his head.</p>

    <p>"A doctor Liu recommended this old Zen master. He said that my family Rongrong is ill. Maybe this old Zen master can do something about it."</p>

    <p>"There is no other way at the moment. Maybe you can try it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded slightly and said: "But I still have a question. That is about the Yin and Yang death calamity..."</p>

    <p>When Sun Yiyuan heard this, his pupils trembled: "How did the True Lord know about this!?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Sun. I am the only one who knows about this matter. If I don't even know about this matter, then wouldn't I, the world's number one True Venerated Immortal., be just a bastard?" Lord Diulei laughed at himself.</p>

    <p>Because he does seem to be a gangster... Ever since he followed Wang Ling, he has mixed up everything.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, according to the normal training process, he will still have to develop for a long time!</p>

    <p>As for the Yin-Yang Death Tribulation, it was actually Wang Ling who told him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I just want to ask, where is the senior who deduced the yin and yang death calamity now? The person who untied the bell must also tie the bell. Maybe he can find a solution for Miss Sun's matter."</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun shook his head helplessly: "As far as I know, this person is no longer alive..."</p>

    <p>"He's no longer in this world..." Lord Diulei was surprised.</p>

    <p>If the person died recently, maybe Wang Ling can use resurrection spells to directly "reincarnate" the person.</p>

    <p>For example, Warden Liang was rescued after the Void Incident.</p>

    <p>But now it sounds like the senior fortune teller may have passed away a long time ago. Even the ashes have flown to nowhere... In this case, the resurrection technique cannot be locked to a specific person, so it is completely useless.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Yiyuan looked at Lord Diulei: "Here at the hospital, I have to receive experts from other cities. So, I have a heartfelt request..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei understood instantly: "I know what Mr. Sun wants to say. Does Mr. Sun want me to find out the truth about Zen Master Jin Deng?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Sun Yiyuan bowed.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Sun. I will do my best." Lord Diulei assured.</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun was extremely moved: "From now on, Mr. Zhenjun, don't call me husband. From now on, we will treat each other as brothers! Everything will be done to Brother Diulei!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Sun, don't worry. It's just a matter of words. It's my duty to do so." Lord Diulei said, cupping his fists.</p>

    <p>He knows it very well.</p>

    <p>This gang is not only helping Sun Yiyuan. In fact, they are also helping Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In order to save Sun Rong's life, his brother's hand has not stopped since the morning...</p>

    <p>Without further ado, Lord Diulei decided to set off immediately.</p>

    <p>This is a race against time.</p>

    <p>The death talisman is consumed faster and faster.</p>

    <p>If the situation is allowed to develop, it will probably become one picture per second in the end.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the Wang family's villa. Wang Ling's body mechanically draws Talisman.</p>

    <p>The death talismans were quickly produced one after another. Then they were placed neatly aside.</p>

    <p>These talismans are consumed over time according to the order of production...</p>

    <p>The table, floor, and bed were all covered with death talismans.</p>

    <p>All the spirits in the Wang family villa were mobilized.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma is responsible for the remote transmission of talisman papers. Zhen Immortal and Bed Immortal are responsible for maintaining order on site and sorting out the talisman papers that have been drawn...</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the man in front of him who was painting Talisman with fascination. He was also shocked in his heart...</p>

    <p>When Little Master Lingzi does his homework, he is not so serious!</p>

    <p>If you rate the level of seriousness. Wang Ling in making Talisman should have reached level 4 of seriousness!</p>

    <p>This is already a very high level!</p>

    <p>Because the highest level is only level 5!</p>

    <p>And level 5 will only appear when Little Master Ling eats crispy noodles!</p>

    <p>In fact.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is now in an out-of-body state.</p>

    <p>He used muscle memory to set up his body so that it would repeat the movements of Talisman over and over again.</p>

    <p>It's like a human-shaped printer.</p>

    <p>However, this operation requires someone to assist you.</p>

    <p>So Er Ha can't leave at all now. Because he has to keep delivering talismans to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Committee. The soul body of Wang Ling came here after leaving the body.</p>

    <p>Because he wants to find someone.</p>

    <p>He hasn't officially entered the Heavenly Dao conference room yet. The table god in the conference room was instantly frightened.</p>

    <p>"Shit! He's here again!!!" The last time this man just asked "Where is Heavenly Dao" three times from below, it overturned his entire Heavenly Dao conference table!</p>

    <p>Now I'm in heaven again... it's obvious that the person who came here is evil!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, I'll take the first step..."</p>

    <p>The table god had a premonition that something was not going to happen, so he ran away again. He was afraid that Wang Ling would slap himself in half with his palm.</p>

    <p>The rest of Heavenly Dao trembled. Because the scene in front of him was too familiar: "What happened to him... Why is he so angry..."</p>

    <p>"No! He's aiming at me!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Heavenly Dao felt like the hairs on his body were standing on end.</p>

    <p>When he came to his senses, he already felt the man holding a mahogany sword on his neck.</p>

    <p>Just a moment. Death on Heavenly Dao's head.</p>

    <p>A huge word "danger" suddenly appeared...</p>
