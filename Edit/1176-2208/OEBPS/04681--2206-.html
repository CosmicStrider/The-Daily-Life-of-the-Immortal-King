  <h1>Chapter 2206 Escape from Earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong secretly observed the ferry parked in the center of the river in Lao Huang's car. Today, Wang Ling is becoming more and more skilled in blaming others.</p>

    <p>He decided to board the ferry and take a look.</p>

    <p>But just in case, out of caution, he still sent a positioning message to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Previously, he gave Zhuo Yi an electronic eyeball. This electronic eyeball is a magic weapon that combines modern cultivation technology and the secret technique of Heavenly Dao. It is also smelted with half a drop of blood essence from Wang Tong. Therefore, it can be found in Wang Ling Obtained part of Wang Tong's perspective with permission.</p>

    <p>And once Zhuo Yi obtained the remote monitoring authority of the electronic eyeball, he understood that this was another mission sent to him by his master.</p>

    <p>In the evening, it was the time for Jiugong Liangzi and Zhuo Yi Niwai. After Zhuo Yi received the instruction from Wang Ling, Liangzi's face was obviously unhappy.</p>

    <p>"You're so busy..." she said, but she didn't show it too obviously. This was just an appropriate emotional reaction for a girl in a normal relationship. It didn't mean she was dissatisfied with anyone.</p>

    <p>As a boyfriend, Zhuo Yi naturally understands Jiugong Liangzi's unhappiness. He could only hold the other person in his arms and hold him tightly: "Recently, there have been more incidents of alien smuggling, which may bring potential consequences to the earth. The danger and trouble. Wait for me, please. Liangzi."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi spoke to Jiugong Liangzi as gently as possible. He knew that Liangzi was by no means an unreasonable person.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hugged his neck and kissed him on the cheek: "Then you have to come back early."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Zhuo Yi smiled. Immediately, a clone formed on the spot and was left to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at the double. Instead, he felt a sense of emptiness in his heart: "It's the clone again..." Although the clone has the same memory as the original body, and after the clone dissipates and returns to the original body, the memories of the time spent with the clone will also return to the original body. Above. But Jiugong Liangzi just feels a little weird.</p>

    <p>She still wants to spend more time with Zhuo Yi's true body. Use a clone instead. What's the difference between this and finding an inflated doll...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By the river. Wang Ling and Sun Rong did not board the ferry immediately. They observed the spot for a while. Soon they discovered that there was a vortex hidden in the clouds above the center of the river. This vortex radiated out A light that was imperceptible to the naked eye was directed towards the ferry.</p>

    <p>"This is the light of guidance."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed it quickly.</p>

    <p>It's pretty much what Wang Ling guessed. The aliens on this ferry are not just the polyhedral aliens in Lao Huang's information. Most of them are aliens working undercover on the earth. Because they have already They were discovered by the authorities and were forced to terminate the mission. So they gathered on this ferry and waited for someone to pick them up, thus escaping from the earth.</p>

    <p>"The industrial chain is very mature..." Sun Rong frowned and said, "These criminal organizations accomplish their ulterior purposes by hiring these alien beings who have not passed the alien database on Earth. Then they contact third parties. Send them away. This is a complete industrial chain. And being able to send them away proves that the people behind it also have certain strength."</p>

    <p>The two analyzed it for a while. Only Lao Huang was completely confused. He didn't see the ferry, let alone the light of guidance in Wang Ling, Sun Rong's mouths. There was a deep feeling in his heart. Deep frustration.</p>

    <p>Are all the high school students in the world of cultivation these days so busy? It made him feel very powerless as an adult.</p>

    <p>Of course. As the only adult at the scene, Lao Huang still showed his courage at the critical moment. He volunteered and said: "How about it. Do you want me to interrupt them? Are they already being escorted? If you let them escape, Sorry. If it's not convenient for you to show up, you might as well tell me the coordinates and I'll interrupt them."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang does have a good heart. Wang Ling also agrees with this. But Wang Ling has always been a person who is afraid of trouble. He stared at Lao Huang for a while and felt that the process was a bit too complicated.</p>

    <p>It's not that Wang Ling didn't believe that Lao Huang couldn't deal with this group of stowaway aliens. It was just that he used Wang Tong to scan the ferry. There were too many aliens inside...</p>

    <p>It is very likely that Lao Huang will not be able to take care of him completely.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling needs is to take it away in one pot. Catch them all in one go.</p>

    <p>So before Lao Huang finished speaking, he saw a huge human hand appear in the sky. It appeared above the center of the river like an illusion projected by a mirage...</p>

    <p>He didn't see the ferry mentioned by Wang Ling, Sun Rong. He didn't see the light of reception. But this huge hand in the sky was like an illusion. But Lao Huang saw it clearly. </p>

    <p>At this moment, Lao Huang fell silent. Although this hand was huge, he had seen it before!</p>

    <p>Isn't this the hand of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Although the visual effect was magnified countless times, as a professional painter, Lao Huang still recognized the details of the hand at a glance. And at this moment Wang Ling was sitting in the car with this hand of the sky. Almost exactly the same action.</p>

    <p>This made Lao Huang look numb...</p>

    <p>Under the current human cultivation system on Earth, the theoretical spell levels are approximately 1-15. Spells above level 10 are super-level spells.</p>

    <p>The ninth-level master of the True Immortal Realm currently known to mankind. He can release up to 13th-level spells. He has the power to destroy the world and move mountains and seas.</p>

    <p>]</p>

    <p>Although Lao Huang already knew that Wang Ling was extraordinary. But this hand that appeared in the sky directly stirred the clouds and mist that brought the light to a pulp in an instant...</p>

    <p>No matter how you look at it, this is a super-level spell!</p>

    <p>Lao Huang opened his mouth. For a moment, he didn't know how to evaluate the scene in front of him: "I remember. You are from the Sixty School, right...Do you still accept people from your school? I want to go to high school again..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang: "I don't mean anything else. I just feel that the knowledge I learned back then is not thorough enough..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>
