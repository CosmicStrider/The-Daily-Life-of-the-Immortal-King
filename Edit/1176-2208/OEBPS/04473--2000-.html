  <h1>Chapter 2000: You offended the abbot and still want to leave?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: It can only be said that You Yueqing's origin is indeed extraordinary. The monk only made a rough calculation and although he could deduce her identity, he could not deduce her fate.</p>

    <p>There is a hazy feeling...</p>

    <p>The last time the monk saw this happened, it was with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In terms of strength, You Yueqing is definitely not as evil as Wang Ling. But she is not weak either.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he still hides his strength.</p>

    <p>However, it seems that it is not a bad idea to use a swastika to break through it. Although You Yueqing is mysterious, she is not like Wang Ling who can backfire against him.</p>

    <p>But out of politeness, the monk suppressed his curiosity and did not take action directly.</p>

    <p>This was the female benefactor whom he had just met. The monk felt that there was no need to make the relationship so stiff at the beginning.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the monk kept his face calm, but in fact, his heart was slightly disturbed.</p>

    <p>This girl is extraordinary. She is also very familiar with Wang Ling. She may play a key role in the future...</p>

    <p>"Principal Dai's strength is not weak. I think a tie between Senior and Principal Dai this time may be the best way to stabilize the situation." At this time, You Yueqing said while sipping tea.</p>

    <p>"Of course the poor monk knows. But... the poor monk has the idea of a poor monk." The monk stopped pretending. He had actually been holding it in for a long time in school. He had to be careful not to use the word "poor monk" at all times. He blurted it out so as not to expose himself. At this moment, You Yueqing's appearance actually made him feel more at ease.</p>

    <p>"Senior, you won't really want to be cruel, right?"</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was because the movies and TV dramas she watched as a child were too classic. Every time You Yueqing came into contact with these holy monks, the classic line "The drunk abbot wants to leave" would always come to mind involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Even when she met the monks in reality, You Yueqing once felt very petty.</p>

    <p>"He's coming..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, a gust of wind swept through the window of the vice-principal's office.</p>

    <p>The sky above Number 60 High School. Stormy clouds are rolling in at this moment.</p>

    <p>In the distance, a large black cloud turned into a shading palm and divided the sky into two halves. It headed towards Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The surrounding streets have all been under martial law for a long time. Because Dai Tianchun insisted on attending the principal's appointment, the local Xiuzhen Police Station had already evacuated the people in advance under the notice from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of ordinary cultivators, I have never seen a powerful person of the Itinerant Immortal level fight, let alone a battle of this level between the principals of the two schools...</p>

    <p>Many people have heard of Dai Tianchun's power. This was the battlefield killing god who was very popular back then! Now he has taken over Shengke and started scientific research. With the assistance of scientific cultivation, he is probably even stronger than before. There are even more thrilling improvements!</p>

    <p>When this astonishing spiritual pressure came from outside the door of 60 High School, You Yueqing tightly grasped the handle of the chair.</p>

    <p>This kind of tension was suffocating. It made You Yueqing feel like she had been put on a jumping machine at an amusement park without wearing a seat belt. Her whole nerves were tense in an instant.</p>

    <p>The fact is that it's not just You Yueqing. The other teachers in the school also feel the same way. Everyone's expressions are not calm.</p>

    <p>When they looked at the school gate again, this sudden drop in terrifying spiritual pressure had even caused the teachers to hallucinate.</p>

    <p>Right at the gate of Number 60 High School. At this moment, there seemed to be countless torrents of blood rushing. It directly broke through the gate of Number 60 High School and poured into the campus...</p>

    <p>This scene is very similar to the classic special effects scene in the movie "The Shining." It makes everyone enveloped in a terrifying murderous aura.</p>

    <p>At this time, a spiritual light emerged from the monk's palm, directly covering the entire Number 60 High School campus.</p>

    <p>The holy golden light of Buddhism erupted directly above Number 60 High School. It was a scene of a charity ferry. The endless golden Buddha light fell from the sky above the clouds. It instantly blocked the murderous atmosphere and eliminated it invisible.</p>

    <p>"Senior..."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was a little frightened. Although she knew that the monk was very strong, she did not expect that the monk was stronger than she had imagined.</p>

    <p>"Don't move here. The poor monk comes as he goes."</p>

    <p>The monk left these words to You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to jump out from the window of the vice-principal's office, a familiar voice sounded in the monk's mind.</p>

    <p>That's a remote request from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The monk had actually known for a long time that Wang Ling would definitely give instructions. He just kept waiting.</p>

    <p>Now that he has received the order, he feels a lot more at peace.</p>

    <p>He quickly made a Buddha salute to the sky: "Amitabha. Ling Zhenren's instructions. The poor monk is already aware of this matter. The poor monk will definitely handle it cleanly. It will not bring shame to Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>After saying this, the monk opened the window and transformed into a ray of Buddha light and jumped down.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the air condenses. Everything around seems to have stopped.</p>

    <p>Even the fallen leaves that were rolled up crazily and blown by the wind were frozen in the air. Only monk Jin Deng and Dai Tianchun were left looking at each other across the gate of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Inherent spiritual realm?</p>

    <p>Wrong...</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun frowned slightly. The nearby scene did not change. It was just frozen.</p>

    <p>This means that it is not that he was involved in the inherent spiritual realm by the other party.</p>

    <p>"You are already in the spiritual world of the poor monk."</p>

    <p>The monk spoke. The sound of the great avenue was ethereal and descended directly from the sky. Immediately, Dai Tianchun was so shocked that he took three steps back.</p>

    <p>At this point, Dai Tianchun was horrified. There was a look of disbelief on his face. It was hard to believe that the vice-principal of Number 60 High School was actually a master of Buddhism!</p>

    <p>It turned out to be a monk...</p>

    <p>Although Dai Tianchun had already thought that the unknown vice-principal of Number 60 High School must be a good person.</p>

    <p>But he was stunned and didn't expect that the other party turned out to be a monk.</p>

    <p>And he seems to be no ordinary monk.</p>

    <p>A normal monk would never be able to pull him into the spiritual world without him noticing.</p>

    <p>"Monk, do you know who I am? Bring me closer to your own spiritual world. Have you ever thought about the consequences?" There was no panic on Dai Tianchun's face.</p>

    <p>With his Taoist practice, he has come into contact with a lot of monks. Anyway, the legendary sage of Buddhism is just a legend among monks. He has never encountered him in the real world.</p>

    <p>Except for the sage of Buddhism, he would not be frightened when meeting any monk in the real world. Including...the one in front of him!</p>

    <p>"Back then, the God of Death was very brave and good at fighting on the battlefield. I have seen this before." The monk clasped his hands together and closed his eyes slightly as he replied.</p>

    <p>He did have a face-to-face encounter with the young Dai Tianchun on the battlefield back then. But that was already an experience of his previous reincarnations.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun is like a monk.</p>

    <p>He's just a passer-by in these thousands of reincarnations...</p>

    <p>At the school gate, Dai Tianchun couldn't stop laughing: "Monk, since you have met me face to face, you know that I have killed many people who claimed to be geniuses. You dragged me into your spiritual world. Then you may bear it. Is it the blood debt I accumulated from killing creatures over the years..."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun asked the question sincerely.</p>

    <p>On the battlefield, he killed people like crazy. That's why he was named the God of Killing.</p>

    <p>For so many years, he tried his best to suppress the ferocity surging in his heart. Now this monk actually took the initiative to pull him into the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>In Dai Tianchun's opinion, this monk doesn't want to live anymore. If he releases all the blood debt and murderous intent of the year, the monk's spiritual world will directly collapse. And he will not only be able to return to the real world unscathed, but also You can see the vice principal of Number 60 High School embarrassed because of his mental disorder.</p>

    <p>He is just a monk. I want to challenge him.</p>

    <p>Simply overestimating one's capabilities...</p>
