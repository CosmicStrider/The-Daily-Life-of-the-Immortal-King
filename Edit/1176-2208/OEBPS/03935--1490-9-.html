  <h1>Chapter 1490 Jiugong Tongxīng</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi changed into a light white sportswear.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is Junko Zhongchun's clothes.</p>

    <p>Considering that there will be more "field work" later on, it seems more convenient to move around in sportswear.</p>

    <p>She tied her hair up and put on a white peaked cap to hold it down. From a distance, she looked like a good-looking boy.</p>

    <p>Of course. The main reason that makes Jiugong Liangzi look like a boy in this outfit is not the sportswear, not the bunted hair, and not the peaked cap. It is because the height of the chest is really not high.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi personally drove Jiugong Liangzi to the place where Jin Deng currently stayed. On the way, out of the corner of his eye, he would look at the girl sitting next to him in the passenger seat with her arms folded and her eyes slightly closed.</p>

    <p>Halfway through the journey, Jiugong Liangzi finally couldn't bear it anymore: "Have you seen enough?"</p>

    <p>"Shouldn't I be the one to ask this?" Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel without any panic.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Jiugong Liangzi frowned.</p>

    <p>"You don't look at me. How do you know I'm looking at you?"</p>

    <p>"..." This question made Jiugong Liangzi stunned on the spot.</p>

    <p>This is Zhuo Yi's usual hooligan-style sophistry. She knows that as a foreigner, if she continues to quarrel with Zhuo Yi, she will most likely fall behind.</p>

    <p>So he simply snorted and turned around.</p>

    <p>"If you want to see it, just be generous and look at me through the reflection in the glass window. Isn't that a bit too petty?" Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"You...are talking nonsense!" I wonder if Zhuo Yi was right. The girl's face became hot.</p>

    <p>"Are you talking nonsense? You can figure it out yourself."</p>

    <p>"You haven't been looking at me with your peripheral vision..."</p>

    <p>"I'm driving. I have to look at the road. I have no choice. I can only look at you with my peripheral vision."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>She was thankful that the car was driving through a tunnel now. The environment inside was relatively dark. It was impossible to see the change in her expression. Otherwise, it would have been too embarrassing.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is a person who can adjust his emotions quickly. This is something that even Sun Rong cannot match.</p>

    <p>The moment the car drove out of the tunnel, the girl's face returned to normal and turned into that cold poker face again.</p>

    <p>Pity...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed inwardly. He never denied that he liked to tease Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The main reason is because he deeply feels the cute side of the girl. But the problem is that Jiugong Liangzi's emotions fluctuate quickly and he adjusts quickly. It really makes Zhuo Yi sometimes unable to tell what the girl is thinking inside.</p>

    <p>"How did you do it?" Finally. Zhuo Yi couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"Your emotional calming skills."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed: "When I was a child, I worked as a child star for a while."</p>

    <p>"Oh, so you have been involved in the entertainment industry?" Zhuo Yi was surprised: "That's not right. But it seems that this has never been mentioned on your resume? Which film and television series have you filmed?"</p>

    <p>"It's just an advertisement." Jiugong Liangzi frowned slightly. He seemed unwilling to face his past.</p>

    <p>"Then why didn't you consider continuing? You didn't become crippled. Instead, you became cuter."</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi said this, Jiugong Liangzi quickly raised his hand and pressed his hat. He tried his best to restrain his expression.</p>

    <p>"This was never what I wanted to do...it was the result of my mother's wishful thinking." Jiugong Liangzi explained.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that she never wants to mention that she once worked as a "child star" in commercials.</p>

    <p>In Jiugong Liangzi's opinion, this is actually a "black history."</p>

    <p>Of course, the female bodyguard Junko knew about this. But because she knew it was a "minefield", Junko Zhongchun never mentioned it.</p>

    <p>But now Jiugong Liangzi actually brought it up. And it was in front of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This made her feel a little incredible.</p>

    <p>For a long time after that, the car fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Finally, he found an opportunity to be alone with the girl. Zhuo Yi would certainly not miss this kind of teasing between the two people.</p>

    <p>He knew that Jiugong Liangzi had always been more concerned about his image. In a situation like this where no outsiders were around, it didn't matter even if he made a little joke, because no one else heard it.</p>

    <p>"What commercials have you filmed?"Zhuo Yi then asked.</p>

    <p>"..." The corners of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>She thought the topic had been discussed.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. She underestimated Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This old liar obviously did it on purpose...</p>

    <p>"None of your business..." She clenched her little fists. The expression on her face changed like the energy indicator light on Ultraman's chest.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this a serious advertisement?" Zhuo Yi deliberately used clichés.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's serious! It's a lifestyle advertisement! It's something used in every household!" Jiugong Liangzi was excited. He quickly realized that he had let slip something.</p>

    <p>"Lifestyle advertising?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought for a moment: "Toilet paper? Roll paper?"</p>

    <p>He was the first to think of this answer.</p>

    <p>After all, these two are essential things for single men.</p>

    <p>In every lonely late night...there is always toilet paper. It is also the romance of a man living alone.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the expression on the girl's face didn't change much. Zhuo Yi knew that 80% of his guesses were wrong. He quickly changed his words: "It can't be family planning supplies..."</p>

    <p>"I was so cute when I was a kid! Everyone who saw me made them want to have more babies! How could I endorse family planning products..." After Jiugong Liangzi finished speaking, she found that she had been tricked by Zhuo Yi again.</p>

    <p>This is the interrogation technique that Zhuo Yi learned from Lao Liang at Songhai City Number 1 Prison.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi I never thought that it could be useful in love.</p>

    <p>He was driving a car. Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel. He suddenly laughed and said, "I see...the advertisement you are endorsing is not for diapers or something..."</p>

    <p>After all. This is an advertisement that Jiugong Liangzi regards as black history.</p>

    <p>This is the only type that Zhuo Yi can think of.</p>

    <p>What do baby diaper ads look like?</p>

    <p>The scene of an ignorant baby crawling around with its bare butt on a soft mat without knowing anything and being teased by the staff... Just thinking about it makes me feel ashamed.</p>

    <p>This time, Jiugong Liangzi completely buried his head in his knees, looking autistic.</p>

    <p>She listened to Zhuo Yi's laughter and tried hard to hold back her laughter. Finally, she suddenly raised her head and looked at him with a very gloomy expression: "If you dare to search...I will never pay attention to you again!"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. It won't happen." Zhuo Yi comforted him.</p>

    <p>In fact, that's exactly what he had in mind...</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, he drove the car towards an uphill mountain road.</p>

    <p>"What is this place?"</p>

    <p>"I have already contacted Senior Jin Deng. Senior Jin Deng has been meditating in the mountains these days."</p>

    <p>The car drove halfway up the mountain. There was no road for vehicles to go uphill. This was an abandoned viewing platform. No one had been there for a long time. Because there had been countless accidents here, the road had long been destroyed. is closed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had no choice but to park the car on the spot and chose to walk up the mountain with Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>"Is Jin Deng-senpai really in a place like this..."</p>

    <p>"This is Fenglei Mountain. Due to the special geographical environment, thunderclouds are often shrouded on the top of the mountain. However, for cultivators, it is a good place for body tempering because there is a certain probability of being struck by lightning."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi followed Zhuo Yi up the uphill mountain road with hesitation.</p>

    <p>No sign of Monk Jin Deng was seen. However, Monk Jin Deng's voice was heard.</p>

    <p>The girl was stunned for a moment...</p>

    <p>It sounds like it is a mantra for exorcising demons: "The mighty heavenly dragon, the World Honored Ksitigarbha, the Great Law Mantra, Prajna Buddhas, Prajna Bamacuo! The flying dragon is in the sky! - Go!"</p>

    <p>After reciting the mantra. Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi saw a thousand-foot thunder dragon rushing toward the sky from the top of the mountain...</p>
