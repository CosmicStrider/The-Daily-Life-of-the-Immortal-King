  <h1>Chapter 2199 People with special abilities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a teahouse with a mix of ancient and modern architecture in the Immortal District of Nannan, Songhai City. The afterglow of the evening sun illuminates the mahogany-textured eaves outside the teahouse even more.</p>

    <p>Several young monks who were in a hurry entered the teahouse. After showing their electronic reservation vouchers to the staff at the front desk, they completed the genetic antigen test at the door before being allowed into the teahouse.</p>

    <p>"When did you become so strict?" asked the leader of the young man with yellow hair. Although he had dissatisfaction written on his face, he still cooperated with the inspection honestly. After pricking his fingertip with a disposable fine needle. Dropped a drop of blood mixed with his own spiritual power into the testing kit.</p>

    <p>"Hello sir. I'm sorry. This is the latest notification from above."</p>

    <p>The manager of the tea house quickly came to the front desk and explained. He bowed and apologized: "We are also acting according to the rules. Thank you for your cooperation."</p>

    <p>"Is this thing really useful?" Huang Mao looked at the test kit in front of him.</p>

    <p>After he and his companions dripped blood according to the correct operating procedures, the center reading port of the test kit was quickly covered by a burst of blue. Finally, a dark red bar was left in area A.</p>

    <p>"As you can see, sir, there are two lines in the genetic antigen. One bar in area A. It means that you are all serious human monks on earth. One bar in area B means the test is invalid. If there are two bars, then 95% of them are. The possibility is unmistakable that they are aliens in disguise on Earth."</p>

    <p>The teahouse supervisor sighed: "As the earth establishes diplomatic relations with all major alien beings, the earth's influence further expands. There are countless alien beings smuggled into the earth."</p>

    <p>The problem mentioned by the teahouse supervisor is also the main problem facing today's cultivating society. The purpose of genetic antigen monitoring is to prevent these smuggled aliens from pretending to be humans in some deceptive ways, thereby using the cloak of human monks to do illegal things on the earth. Activities.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, this will destroy the existing order of human monks on earth. On the other hand, it will also reduce the favorability of human monks on earth in the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Now there are companies that specialize in organizing and capturing these smuggled aliens. In a sense, it also provides a lot of jobs for modern human monks.</p>

    <p>Most of these companies have direct subcontracting contracts with departments such as the Cultivation Police Department. And they will be classified according to the circumstances of the captured aliens.</p>

    <p>Those who have committed obvious crimes will be escorted directly to the police station to await sentencing. Aliens who have committed no crimes and are willing to continue to stay on Earth may later obtain legal Earth ID cards to live on Earth.</p>

    <p>At present, the earth's strategy towards aliens is relatively friendly. As long as they do not invade the earth, then forming good relationships is the signal sent by the International United Association of Cultivators on the earth.</p>

    <p>To sum it up: peace.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After completing the antigen at the bottom of the teahouse, Huang Mao, the leader, and the three people following him were led by the waiter. A total of four people were taken into an independent private room on the third floor.</p>

    <p>As the waiter completed the work of pouring tea and water, the waiter skillfully closed the sliding door of the private room and turned on the do not disturb timer button outside.</p>

    <p>A soundproof psychic barrier was immediately generated. During this period, any conversation inside would not be transmitted outside this private room.</p>

    <p>In the private room, there sat a feminine man with heavy makeup. He was carrying an electric guitar on his back. The foundation on his face was as white as snow. The pink moganxi head made him look alone.</p>

    <p>When those yellow men saw this person, they were immediately stunned.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought they had gone to the wrong private room.</p>

    <p>But soon the Moganxitou man laughed: "Sit down. You are right. I am Teacher Duan from the Universe Infinite Group."</p>

    <p>"I've heard about Teacher Duan for a long time..."</p>

    <p>Huang Mao and several young people sat down respectively.</p>

    <p>If the man hadn't reported his family status, they would never have thought that the abnormal-looking man in front of them... was the chief interviewer of the Universe Infinite Group. Duan Hantian.</p>

    <p>"You should know that according to the mission issued by the company this time, it is actually not easy to find the group of smuggled aliens in the entire Songhai." Duan Hantian said while tapping the table gently with his long black nails: "But the company can see that you are very special talents, so it allows me to provide you with a little help."</p>

    <p>"But... doesn't that count as cheating?" Huang Mao, the leader, frowned.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't count. Collecting information is part of the ability test. If you can get the information I provide, that's your own ability."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian laughed: "And my information is not so straightforward. It requires thinking. If you are incompetent idiots, I don't need to waste my words at all."</p>

    <p>Huang Mao heard this and looked at each other with several people.</p>

    <p>"You are a team of four. And everyone has unique skills. I think your ability should not be inferior to other teams. As far as I know, one of the interviewers was accompanied by two high school students. Be a foreign aid."</p>

    <p>"High school students...become foreign aid?"</p>

    <p>Huang Mao also laughed when he heard this: "This can't be considered foreign aid at all. Isn't this high school student here to complete outdoor training homework?"</p>

    <p>"Probably." Duan Hantian said with a smile, "But they are obviously just a joke. I saw the interviewer. His special ability is spiritual painting. And his ability to visualize spiritual power is better than those who can usually paint using the immortal method. The painter is better. But this is not what our big boss wants. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"I understand." Huang Mao nodded.</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian crossed his fingers, held his chin, and looked directly at Huang Mao: "No. It seems now that you don't understand."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Huang Mao was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"You don't think you can get free information from me. Is it that simple?"</p>

    <p>"knew."</p>

    <p>Huang Mao took a deep breath. Then he looked at Duan Hantian: "So, you want to see what my specific abilities are?"</p>

    <p>"I know. The four of you have systems. And they are very strong systems. But as the chief interviewer, I think I still need to know your system capabilities."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian said: "I know. This may be a taboo for you. But I think that honesty is the basis of everything. In the current market, you can hardly find a more suitable company than us. Our Universe Infinite Group. Have the ability to meet the ultimate needs of those of you with system abilities."</p>

    <p>"The final requirement..." Huang Mao frowned.</p>

    <p>"Although you have powerful system capabilities, you know nothing about the information behind the system designer. To you, the system designer is God. You dare not offend the gods. You have great respect for him. But if one day. Your god has taken back the system in you. Then you will become completely useless."</p>

    <p>"..." Huang Mao and the other three fell into silence.</p>

    <p>"So for you, what you hope most is that you can always firmly control the system's capabilities in your own hands."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian said: "And our company has the ability to help you make the system independent, so that you...will always be your own master!"</p>
