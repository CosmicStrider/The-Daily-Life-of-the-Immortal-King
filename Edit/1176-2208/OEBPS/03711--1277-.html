  <h1>Chapter 1277 The disappearing sense of existence</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The girl gradually became transparent. This was something neither Heavenly Dao nor Zhuo Yi expected.</p>

    <p>But soon. Death Heavenly Dao thought about what happened: "I didn't expect this legend to be true..."</p>

    <p>"What legend?" Zhuo Yi asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>"It is said that Dao Ancestor specially set up a secret method to prevent people from being resurrected without limit through means such as death talismans and changing their fate against the will of heaven... As long as the resurrection exceeds a certain number of times, the resurrected person will have a sense of existence. It will reduce..."</p>

    <p>"Reducing the sense of presence?" Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"The sense of existence is reduced to the end. Miss Sun will be completely transparent. Theoretically, she is not dead. But others cannot touch her, nor can they hear her voice. And what she says to other people cannot be heard. People can hear..."</p>

    <p>"Then what's the difference between this and death?"</p>

    <p>"The difference is that she is not on Heavenly Dao's death list. She does not even have the chance of reincarnation. She can only drift in the world forever and become a void spirit..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Isn't that similar to Void Spirit?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao sighed: "If this is the case, it is better to become a virtual spirit. At least the virtual spirit is a complete living body..."</p>

    <p>"Is there any way to stop it?" Zhuo Yi never thought that such an operation could be done.</p>

    <p>This girl's presence in the book is already low enough...</p>

    <p>Now, Heavenly Dao is forced to reduce his presence. It's so miserable!</p>

    <p>"Unless you are a Heavenly Dao whitelist user, you cannot use the resurrection method without restrictions."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao slowly shook his head. He stared at the girl in the medical cabin who was gradually reducing her transparency. He said: "Furthermore, in order to prevent cheating, Dao Ancestor... the whitelist has a 48-hour review time. In other words, even if Miss Sun is now Join the whitelist. It's too late. She only has 48 hours. The body will be completely transparent..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Saturday, November 28th.</p>

    <p>A plan to destroy the "Unspeakable Land", exterminate the evil Heavenly Dao, and save Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The formal agreement was completed through joint discussion between Wang Ling, Jin Deng and Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The entire plan is divided into three parts.</p>

    <p>First: Find the ancient Heavenly Dao lurking on the earth. Temporarily block the yin and yang death catastrophe.</p>

    <p>Second: Complete the upgrade of the earth. Cultivate multiple reliable cultivators to guard the earth.</p>

    <p>Third: Let the monk lead the way. Break through the unspeakable place together with Wang Ling. Destroy all the evil that Dao Ancestor Wang left behind back then. Thus cutting off the root cause of the "Yin and Yang Death Tribulation."</p>

    <p>The monk does everything outside. Wang Ling only needs to assist behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>This should be one of the people Wang Ling has contacted so far. He is relatively reliable in all aspects.</p>

    <p>But there is actually one thing that puzzles Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling always thought that the person who originally calculated Sun Rong's "Yin and Yang Death Tribulation" was the monk himself.</p>

    <p>But after careful questioning, the monk said that he had never told the girl's fortune.</p>

    <p>So now the question comes. Who was that fortune teller back then?</p>

    <p>I'm afraid only Sun Yiyuan knows about this matter.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not usually a meddlesome person. However, this matter is related to the girl's life.</p>

    <p>He still activated his King's Eyes and peered at the fortune teller in Boss Sun's memory from a distance.</p>

    <p>As a result, the sight of King's Eyes was dim.</p>

    <p>Saw nothing.</p>

    <p>"Have you done anything in advance..." Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>There was something wrong with his direction from the start.</p>

    <p>Because he always mistakenly believed that Jin Deng was the original fortune teller, he was late in spying. Instead, the mysterious fortune teller covered up this memory first...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling felt extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on Earth is indeed true.</p>

    <p>It seems. Except for the monks...</p>

    <p>There are also mysterious masters.</p>

    <p>The other party could actually calculate to this point and make preparations in advance. At least it proves that this person's strength is not inferior to that of the monk.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The day after Jin Deng met with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The monk came to the hospital under the leadership of Lord Diulei. A group of experts and doctors gathered at the hospital saw a monk coming to the hospital. They all looked sad.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's all my fault! My medical skills are not good. I couldn't save Miss Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>"It seems that we all have to continue learning! Only in this way can we save more people!"</p>

    <p>When the doctors saw the monk, they all showed expressions of enlightenment. Some even hugged each other and wiped away tears.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't understand what he meant: "Why are you doctors so sad? Isn't Miss Sun still able to be saved now..."</p>

    <p>One of the doctors was stunned for a moment. Then he asked, "So the monk was brought here. Isn't he doing some rituals?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng, Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>This is a serious occasion. Lord Diulei has been specially trained for this. He will never laugh!</p>

    <p>So he tried very hard to keep a straight face and explained the origin of Master Jin Deng to many experts and doctors present.</p>

    <p>"This Zen Master Jin Deng is no ordinary person. He may have a way to save Miss Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>"A monk?"</p>

    <p>Many doctors looked questioningly.</p>

    <p>They are all Taishan Beidou in the medical field. Even they are helpless. How much ability can a wild monk who comes out of nowhere have the ability to save a girl's life?</p>

    <p>In their opinion, this is simply nonsense.</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun, I think this matter may be a little too hasty... We can understand Mr. Sun's mood." The first person to object was Dean Liu Ping. He felt that it was better to be cautious in this matter.</p>

    <p>The monk was smiling. He didn't take what the doctors in front of him said to heart at all.</p>

    <p>He understands people's thoughts very well.</p>

    <p>After all, he has lived in anonymity for so many years and his name is rarely known.</p>

    <p>Without understanding the situation, it is indeed possible to regard him as one of those charlatans.</p>

    <p>However, Master Jin Deng is Master Jin Deng after all. The state of mind of a monk is mysterious and cannot be imagined by ordinary people.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, monks don't lie. I can show you my skills first."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng smiled. Then he stretched out his hand and touched the shoulder of a male doctor: "This benefactor has a hidden disease in his left shoulder due to long-term fatigue. Because the work was delayed for a time, the hidden disease became incurable... On rainy days, the left shoulder will The pain is so painful that I can't help myself. It can only be relieved by dancing at home. Is this poor monk right?"</p>

    <p>"Master... how did the master know?" The doctor was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic. I just opened your left shoulder. It's fine now. You no longer have to live a life of dancing alone at home at night."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk showed off his skills in the conference room of the hospital, showing off his superb consecration skills.</p>

    <p>Everyone began to change their previous attitudes one after another. They began to become enthusiastic!</p>

    <p>"Master! Because of work, my head has always been bald..."</p>

    <p>"It goes without saying, donor. You lost your hair because you saved lives and injured people. I will return it to you now."</p>

    <p>"Master! I always come home late because of work. Every time I come home late, my wife makes me kneel with durians... please touch my knees..."</p>

    <p>"The donor doesn't need to say much. For a poor monk, it's just a simple effort."</p>

    <p>"Master! Because I often stay up late... what's going on? My wife and I have always wanted a baby... please touch me..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk glanced lightly at the doctor's lower body and shook his head: "This donor, it's not that I don't want to help you. But this matter is not your problem..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
