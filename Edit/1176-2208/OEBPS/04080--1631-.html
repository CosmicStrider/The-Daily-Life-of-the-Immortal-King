  <h1>Chapter 1631 The Secret Boss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The large-scale rescue operation was huge. In addition to the alliance army composed of cultivators by gathering the forces of all parties, there were also some boss-level cultivators hiding behind it.</p>

    <p>For example, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, regarding this matter, both Li Xian and Zhang Zhui felt that they had at least a little bit of the blame on them.</p>

    <p>If they could handle things more decisively, maybe with just the strength of the two of them, they could directly find the home of Mrs. Fengchu and directly level this madwoman's base.</p>

    <p>There's no need to bother that Sun Rong girl to do it herself.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui are well aware of the relationship between Sun Rong and Wang Ling. Therefore, they feel deeply ashamed.</p>

    <p>Judging from all the current evidence, the Thousand-Faced Man they are tracking must be related to Mrs. Fengchu.</p>

    <p>In other words, this Mrs. Fengchu is far from being as simple as she seems.</p>

    <p>Such a method with thousands of faces. Even the faces they saw were different. The strength of the person behind it must be eternal.</p>

    <p>So if we make inferences based on this, there are two results before us.</p>

    <p>One is that there is an eternally powerful man working under Mrs. Fengchu.</p>

    <p>The second is the person with the thousand-faced magical power. It is Mrs. Fengchu herself.</p>

    <p>"This Liu Renfeng is just an earth monk. No one from all ages can think highly of him. Unless he was hit by a meteorite and lost his memory. Otherwise, he will never be controlled by an ordinary earth monk like her." Zhang in Riback Coffee Shop. Shui said while sipping her iced latte.</p>

    <p>The Eternal Man in his mouth is the abbreviation of the Eternal Level Powerful One.</p>

    <p>It is also a vocabulary Zhang Zhui recently learned from the Internet.</p>

    <p>It seems very popular among young people nowadays to summarize a type of person as "XX person."</p>

    <p>For example, the people of Zuan, the people who delay the watch, if you don't scold Ku Xuan for a day, you will die from the Star people...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui found it very interesting, so he learned a lesson along the way.</p>

    <p>As a result, I thought about it and found that it was quite fluent. Then Li Xian was successfully led astray.</p>

    <p>"Although I don't think anyone will work under Liu Renfeng, the earth monk. But the question is, isn't Ling Zhenren also an earth monk..." After Li Xian finished speaking, Zhang Zhui opened his mouth. Suddenly I felt speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is very strong.</p>

    <p>It was so strong that they could not imagine or estimate it.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling. is indeed a genuine Earthling.</p>

    <p>And it was born from two Earthlings who couldn't even reach the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>They didn't really believe this at first.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Nuan was born that Li Xian and Zhang Zhui completely accepted this fact.</p>

    <p>Who'd have thought that a newborn Earth girl would be as strong as a monster? She's able to beat the two grandmasters by the neck.</p>

    <p>"So, even if the probability is low, it's not completely impossible?" Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the result that Liu Renfeng and the Thousand-Faced Man are the same person has been weakened a lot after the two of them discussed it.</p>

    <p>"If she were an ancient person, she would never have seen the secret world on Earth. Even if the Earth has been upgraded."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "There are many factors that form the secret realm. To put it simply, it is like a jar of old wine. The older it is, the more valuable the secret realm is. In the infinite galaxy, there are countless unexplored secret realms that have been around for a long time. How can we see it? It's as good as the secret realm on earth now."</p>

    <p>"I agree with this point of view." Li Xian nodded and said: "She Liu Renfeng explores the secret realm just to seek money. This vision is still worse than that of people of all ages."</p>

    <p>"After all, it's just a matter of different realms. Back then, I was also seeking money. But I had a reason." At this time, Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>"Why did Brother Zi Xiang say this?"</p>

    <p>"Money is sin. I'm just taking these sins into my own hands. I suffer in silence." Zhang Zhui sighs: "I will not go to hell. Who will go to hell?"</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>

    <p>About two minutes passed. After Zhang Zhui drank the last sip of coffee in his hand.</p>

    <p>He stood up immediately and said, "Let's go, Brother Li Xian. Let's settle it together." Okay." Li Xian said sternly: "But, how are we going to get in? This time the alliance army battles have unified command and markings symbolizing allies. We don't have anything. Isn't it inappropriate to just go in like this?"</p>

    <p>"There's nothing inappropriate." Zhang Zhui suddenly laughed: "Aren't we just passing by and enthusiastic citizens?"</p>

    <p>So it is.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Li Xian suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were preparing to leave, inside Songhai City Number 1 Prison, the three-person Mahjong action team led by General Bai also launched a new round of operations.</p>

    <p>Because this is a free chance to earn points.</p>

    <p>As long as you join the alliance army, you will earn points.</p>

    <p>Of course. If you can succeed in this operation, the points will be an extra bonus.</p>

    <p>All three of them have been sentenced to more than a thousand years in prison. Such an opportunity to earn points to offset their sentences is naturally impossible to miss.</p>

    <p>"Is it the Miss Sun who's been captured?"</p>

    <p>When General Bai finished telling the whole story, the trio felt incredible.</p>

    <p>They had only heard about it from the prison guards. They knew that there was currently a large-scale coalition operation in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>I thought it was just an exercise. But now I got into General Bai's car and realized what the purpose of such a large-scale coalition was...</p>

    <p>To be honest, the three people in the mahjong group are a bit unexpected.</p>

    <p>"Do you three have any impression of Liu Renfeng?" At this time, General Bai said.</p>

    <p>After all, the three people sitting in the car at the moment are enjoying the top-notch nursing facilities of Songhai City Number 1 Prison. And the most important thing is that the three of them were previously one of the leaders of the evil forces, the dark web and those underground organizations. information. Asking them is all too familiar.</p>

    <p>"You're talking about Liu Fengchu?" the old devil said.</p>

    <p>"It's her." General Bai asked, "What? Are you familiar with her?"</p>

    <p>"I don't have much business dealings. I just met her in the former underground human trafficking market." The old devil said, "I still remember. She and another person are brothers and sisters in the same sect. The other person has a nickname called Wolong. But this one Wolong is indeed very low-key compared to others."</p>

    <p>"You said. They have a master?"</p>

    <p>"There is one. But who is that master? I don't know much about him."</p>

    <p>General Bai held his chin and thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>The Fengchu underground laboratory in the northern suburbs is now under the control of the Allied forces. An encirclement has been formed.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng can't escape now.</p>

    <p>The instructions given to them above were to collect as much evidence as possible in addition to capturing him alive.</p>

    <p>Now that they are already a step too late to start, they may not be able to get any benefits if they intervene head-on.</p>

    <p>So when General Bai heard this, he suddenly felt that he might be able to change his mind and act with the Mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>"This underground human trafficking market. Do you know where it is?" At this time, he raised his head and asked.</p>

    <p>"These people are cunning people. Even if I tell you the address, the place of transaction may have already changed." The old devil said: "If there is no one there by then, then it will be a wasted trip."</p>

    <p>"There are always clues." General Bai said: "You have made a contribution."</p>

    <p>The old devil immediately replied: "In the winter market."</p>

    <p>"Winter market?" Cheng Yu, the head of the Immortal Palace, was stunned.</p>

    <p>The entrance to his immortal mansion back then was in the winter market.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, that was where his dream began...</p>

    <p>But before the dream even started, I was slapped to pieces by Wang Ling...</p>
