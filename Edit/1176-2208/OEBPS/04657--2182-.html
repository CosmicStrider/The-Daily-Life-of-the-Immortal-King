  <h1>Chapter 2182 The double game between reality and illusion â‘¢</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! After Qiao Yanyuan cut off the connection with his clone body, the violent sea of laws suddenly returned to calm. Wang Muyu looked at the golden sea of laws that almost covered his entire core world. There is unprecedented peace in my heart.</p>

    <p>He took a step forward. He couldn't help but reach out and touch this sea of laws.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, be careful." Yi Jianchuan wanted to reach out and pull Wang Muyu. But it was too late. Little Muyu's immature hands had already reached into the sea of laws in front of him.</p>

    <p>A magical thing happened. This golden sea of laws actually didn't hurt him. Instead, he felt a warm power surging throughout his body, repairing the remaining injuries all over his body.</p>

    <p>"This golden sea of laws... still picks people to hurt?" Wang Muyu didn't understand.</p>

    <p>He thought he had inherited a lot of things and knew a lot. But as long as Wang Ling intervened, there would always be things happening that he couldn't understand.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, come and try." Wang Muyu pulled Yi Jianchuan backhand. Of course Yi Jianchuan resisted. He believed that the Law Sea was very dangerous.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Muyu's strength was too great. He couldn't resist Wang Muyu's strength at all. He fell in with a pop and was directly soaked in the sea of laws.</p>

    <p>The severe pain he imagined did not occur. There was no explosion at all. Yi Jianchuan felt a powerful spiritual power pouring into his body.</p>

    <p>"My longevity... seems to have increased..." Yi Jianchuan couldn't believe it. His body had actually become younger. Not only had his longevity increased, but his cultivation also seemed to have increased a bit.</p>

    <p>He had obviously just broken through to the holy realm. As a result, during the time he was soaked in the sea of laws, Yi Jianchuan felt that he had a hint of understanding the Tao realm.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, my teacher... seems to be about to break through again..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Yi Jianchuan's mouth twitched. His whole body was immersed in the sea of laws. He felt an unprecedented spiritual power filling his body.</p>

    <p>More than that, these laws seemed to be lingering around him and guiding him forward, continuously inputting the knowledge of the unreachable realm of Tao into his consciousness.</p>

    <p>This Law Sea not only repaired his body, but also had the effect of guiding consciousness.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan suddenly thought of an idiom.</p>

    <p>This is enlightenment...</p>

    <p>This power suddenly woke him up. It clarified some theories about breakthrough realm that he had been unable to understand. It broadened his original narrow vision and made him suddenly feel enlightened. A feeling of understanding.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the feeling of Taoism is like this... it is not as far away as he imagined.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the teacher is really going to make a breakthrough!" Wang Muyu looked at Yi Jianchuan who was immersed in the sea of laws. He saw his teacher's whole body exuding golden light. It was shining brightly. This was a sign that he was about to break through the Tao realm.</p>

    <p>"But it's strange to say. I don't have that much insight, teacher. I just feel that my body has been repaired."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu stared at Yi Jianchuan. He thought for a moment. Then he banged his hands: "I understand, teacher! This sea of laws has an enlightening effect on monks under the ancestral realm! That's why it can help you realize the Tao so quickly." The essence of scripture!"</p>

    <p>This is the only possibility that Wang Muyu can think of. After all, this sea of laws is a miracle created by Wang Ling combined with Xiang Yi. The effect must be extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu can feel that there is spiritual wisdom in the golden sea of law. A spiritual wisdom that can distinguish good from evil. The sea of law will not easily forgive anything with evil thoughts.</p>

    <p>And this is why Wang Muyu and Yi Jianchuan were not harmed.</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>At this moment, a huge creature jumped up on the calm sea.</p>

    <p>"Is it... a whale? No..." Wang Muyu looked away from a distance. This was a creature with golden light all over its body. Upon closer inspection, it also had a slightly red color. Wang Muyu relied on his precise dynamic vision. Ability to observe repeatedly.</p>

    <p>Final confirmation. This is a huge! Koi!</p>

    <p>In the sea of laws, there is actually such a huge koi fish swimming...</p>

    <p>After being slightly lost for a moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu instantly understood who made this koi fish. It turned out that Wang Ling not only prepared the bullet... the bullet also contained a summoning circle. At the moment when the golden law sea was formed. This huge koi fish was summoned...</p>

    <p>When necessary, the koi fish will take action and become the second trump card to help Wang Muyu get out of trouble.</p>

    <p>This koi fish is too big. When you read it from the golden law sea in the distance, it blocks out the sun and covers the sky. The orderly golden scales render everything as if the gods are descending.</p>

    <p>It flapped its fins and swung its tail, forming waves in the distance and transporting two black spots ashore.</p>

    <p>It was no one else. It was Qiao Yanyuan who had been abandoned by his true body and separated his body and the corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>The two people were so dizzy from the explosion that they completely fainted.</p>

    <p>"It's so pitiful. He was abandoned by his own body." Wang Muyu poked the heads of the two of them. They were still alive, but they could no longer move.</p>

    <p>He stared at the real clone derived from Qiao Yanyuan. He suddenly thought that he had accidentally attracted a clone of Qiao Yanyuan before in the ancestral land. He also called him Er Qiao at the time.</p>

    <p>"I understand. I'll call you San Qiao from now on." Wang Muyu said, staring at San Qiao in front of him.</p>

    <p>Compared with Er Qiao, the San Qiao in front of him is extraordinary. Although he is not as powerful as the main body, at least his body is compatible with many clones from other parallel dimensions. His combat power is still very impressive.</p>

    <p>And the law sea calming down again is actually what Wang Ling means.</p>

    <p>The chess game of Wang Ling has just begun.</p>

    <p>With this Sanqiao...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, Qiao Yanyuan's defeat is already doomed.</p>

    <p>Because he wanted San Qiao to completely replace Qiao Yanyuan, and... reduce Qiao Yanyuan's body to a substitute.</p>
