  <h1>Chapter 2207 1 Net Strike</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Number 60 High School. A sect that mainly trains Foundation Building students. But it is also a sect where the big guys gather to crouching tiger, hidden dragon. From the beginning of the Shadow Stream incident to the incognito killer list of Number 60 High School. After the founder Lao Gudong (Gorgeous itinerant) started, it has been out of control.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling continues to study at Number 60 High School and expands his social circle in daily life, more and more big shots begin to gather here.</p>

    <p>Although those masters of the gods represented by Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi, the orderers represented by Gu Shunzhi, and the eternal ones represented by Jin Deng, do not know what magic there is about Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>But the only thing they know is that even a powerful being like Wang Ling is studying peacefully at Number 60 High School day after day. Then this sect must have something in it...</p>

    <p>Among them, the oldest one has been a transfer student at Number 60 High School for several months. Although so far, he has not found anything extraordinary about this mediocre sect.</p>

    <p>But they believed unswervingly. They didn't realize that they were still too shallow!</p>

    <p>It's because they still don't understand the profound meaning of Wang Ling choosing to study at Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>It's not that Number 60 High School is really that bad.</p>

    <p>In fact, the reason why Wang Ling chose Number 60 High School was because the school was mediocre enough...</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling never thought that he would meet Sun Rong who came to Number 60 High School specifically to make a presence known as soon as he started school. There are also Chen Chao and Guo Hao who can be called Wolong Fengchu's good brothers.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, the daily life of Number 60 High School has never seemed as peaceful as he imagined. But he is about to reach the second year of high school. Having celebrated his seventeenth birthday, he is no longer as peaceful as he used to be. A boy in a corner...</p>

    <p>Even though daily life was much more noisy than he imagined, Wang Ling also found that he was gradually adapting to this life.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's hand fell from a distance. It blocked the sky and the sun. It directly dispersed the vortex hidden in the clouds in the space.</p>

    <p>The moment the "Light of Reception" was interrupted, the black aliens on the invisible ferry began to cause a commotion. No one would have imagined that something unexpected would happen at such a critical moment.</p>

    <p>Some aliens had a premonition that something bad was going to happen. They jumped from the deck and fell into the cold river. However, the moment they were about to touch the surface of the river, a strange spiritual energy quickly circulated around their bodies and began to flow back.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, these aliens who jumped into the river returned to their original positions on the deck one by one. No matter how they escaped from the ferry, a strange force formed a cycle to pull them back out of the river!</p>

    <p>Damn it!</p>

    <p>I have obviously felt the coldness of the river! Why was there not even a drop of water when I was pulled back and put on? Is this the ability to turn back time?</p>

    <p>This is of course not the ability to turn back time. It's just the basic operation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the Hand of the Sky is not to capture these aliens. Wang Ling wants to catch them all. And capture them alive.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in addition to blocking the guiding light, the hand of the sky also has the effect of changing the surrounding space. Wang Ling links the space surrounding the ferry together, forming an unbreakable wall. Ghosts hit the wall. Before the members of the immortal magic mobile team led by Zhuo Yi arrived here, no alien could leave the ferry.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>In the distance, the black-robed monk who was responsible for coming here to pick up these aliens was surprised that someone was involved. Such a method of directly cutting off space would be impossible without the strength above the True Immortal realm!</p>

    <p>"Boss. I'm afraid these aliens can't escape..."</p>

    <p>The black-robed monk thought hard. He tried every means but could not jump over Wang Ling's hand in the sky. This hand was like a city wall. It blocked out all external spiritual energy. It was indestructible.</p>

    <p>He suppressed his blush. Veins popped out at his temples. There was really nothing he could do.</p>

    <p>"Forget it. This is what the masters did. We can't stop it. Since we can't take them away, let's find a way to kill them all before the immortal magic mobile team arrives." At this time, behind the black-robed monk The standing young man finally walked out of the darkness. It was none other than Zhi Jiunian.</p>

    <p>He has been in the talent headhunting business for a long time. In the past, he only dealt with talents from Earth. But now since the upgrade of Earth, he has also set his sights on the alien industry chain.</p>

    <p>Moreover, these aliens with dark backgrounds can be said to be extremely profitable.</p>

    <p>Because they do not have files on the earth, he needs guidance to carry out various tasks. Zhi Jiunian can collect the fees of these black-house aliens and then provide these black-house aliens to the sects in need.</p>

    <p>The advantage is that because these aliens do not have any files, they are very suitable for being sent to do some gray tasks. And for these aliens who do not understand the earth's cultivation methods, they do not know that the gray tasks they are performing are illegal. Behavior. It's just giving your own labor.</p>

    <p>If it is really discovered, Zhi Jiunian will also arrange a dragon's service to escape from the earth. In the days after upgrading from the earth, Zhi Jiunian has only done this. There has never been any mistakes.</p>

    <p>But today, with an expert present, Zhi Jiunian knew that he could not offend.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, he has already placed his own people on this ferry in advance. If any problem arises, he can only kill all these aliens to avoid future troubles!</p>

    <p>After all, a business like this is indeed a knife-edge licking blood. Once the Immortal Technique Mobile Team finds out something, Zhi Jiunian knows very well that he may be dragged into prison for hundreds of years.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you want to kill them all? Okay, boss."</p>

    <p>Inside the ferry. The person who had been placed inside by Zhi Jiunian started taking action after confirming the news. He was a waiter on the wheelbarrow. He had been wearing a Sad Frog doll suit and served these stupid aliens on the ferry. People provide services.</p>

    <p>Due to the language barrier, he can only express his language through body movements, gestures and international friendly gestures. It can be said that he has been looking forward to this day for a long time.</p>

    <p>After receiving the news from Zhi Jiunian, the man wearing a sad frog doll squatted down silently and pulled out a sharp knife from his feet.</p>

    <p>A bloody feast of killing aliens is about to begin...</p>

    <p>Which unlucky guy should we start with?</p>

    <p>He turned his attention to an alien with a big belly.</p>

    <p>This alien creature has the head of a fish and the body of a human. Two long beaks hang down from both sides to its feet. It seems that it must be pregnant.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the little alien doll inside looks like after I cut open my belly...</p>

    <p>"The unlucky one is you!"</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next second, an idea flashed in Sad Frog's hand. The dagger that was previously in the doll suit quickly moved out of the doll suit. He raised his knife high and began to rush towards the fish-headed alien.</p>

    <p>However, in the next second, a beautiful figure appeared in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's figure was too fast. It almost turned into an afterimage and appeared in front of the sad frog. Then it hit the sad frog in the abdomen.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The Sad Frog was kicked to the point where he doubted his life. He took off and ejected on the spot. Then he was teleported back from the other end of the ferry. He knelt down to the feet of Wang Ling who was behind Sun Rong...</p>
