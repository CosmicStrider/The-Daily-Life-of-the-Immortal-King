  <h1>Chapter 1623 Marshal Jiang's request</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The time goes back a few hours. That is, two hours before the end of school at Number 60 High School today.</p>

    <p>The student union office where Sun Rong works received an unexpected person.</p>

    <p>When Marshal Jiang suddenly pushed the door of the student union office, facing the old man who suddenly appeared in front of him, Sun Rong was instinctively stunned.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that with Jiang Yingying's character, stubbornness and stubborn temper, he would never tell his elders what happened between them in private.</p>

    <p>This was a very embarrassing thing for the stubborn girl.</p>

    <p>This can actually be seen from the last time I went to the ancient street to throw Stone Spear.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying still hopes to use his own strength to defeat her.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when he saw Marshal Jiang in front of him, Sun Rong was slightly surprised, but he was also sure that Marshal Jiang was not out for his granddaughter.</p>

    <p>After all, it's not actually the point where I want to stand out yet.</p>

    <p>Even though there is a slight dispute between Sun Rong and Jiang Yingying over the issue of Wang Ling, Sun Rong is still confident about Jiang Yingying's standards in this regard.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, she wouldn't have taken the initiative to ask for a fight to save Jiang Yingying last time in the ancient street.</p>

    <p>If we forget about Wang Ling. Sun Rong once thought that he might become good friends with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"Hello. Rongrong. Do you still remember me?" After entering the door, Marshal Jiang put aside his old-fashioned look when he was in the cadre apartment. He was unusually kind.</p>

    <p>This feeling. Sun Rong seems to have seen it somewhere before.</p>

    <p>After all, there is an old man in her family who loves his granddaughter.</p>

    <p>No matter how stern a person is, as soon as he thinks of his precious granddaughter, his expression will immediately change.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stood up quickly and greeted her politely: "Of course I remember! Why is Uncle Jiang free to come here today? Are you here to ask about Yingying's situation?"</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang held Sun Rong's hand tightly. Then the two sat down on the sofa together.</p>

    <p>It was obvious. The expression on Mr. Jiang's face when he heard Jiang Yingying's words was also a bit off: "The granddaughter is grown up. She is not a young girl after all..."</p>

    <p>He sighed: "I've been trying to talk her out of it. Failed to persuade her to move out of the apartment. A girl. Must move out alone to live. How dangerous it is."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled: "Don't be nervous, Mr. Jiang. Yingying is your granddaughter. Who would dare to touch her?"</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang smiled bitterly: "I know. Naturally, no one would dare to do anything to her. But I'm afraid of those who don't know. Those who don't realize it. I'm still worried. I installed a surveillance camera in her living room. But the girl resents it. She unplugs it every now and then."</p>

    <p>"What about finding someone to protect her?" Sun Rong asked: "Uncle Jiang knows so many people. You can find someone to secretly rent another house next to where classmate Yingying lives."</p>

    <p>"You don't know. This girl is very clever and cautious. All the people I was looking for were spotted by her before and were driven away. I don't know where this girl got her weird judgment..."</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying has an extraordinary sensitivity in this regard. Even Marshal Jiang was amazed.</p>

    <p>"Ah this..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is smiling.</p>

    <p>In fact, after listening to Marshal Jiang say this, she could already vaguely sense Marshal Jiang's appeal...</p>

    <p>"So today I came to see Rongrong. I just wanted to ask Rongrong if he had any ideas." Marshal Jiang said, "Old Sun and I are also old friends. But it's not appropriate to approach him about my granddaughter. That's why I came to you. Girl's Home. Understand each other better."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong fell silent.</p>

    <p>In fact, she doesn't feel that she really understands Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>If she really understood, she wouldn't know why Jiang Yingying keeps pestering Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Obviously this is an unrealistic thing. But the other party has no intention of giving up. And the more he fights, the braver he gets.</p>

    <p>This makes Sun Rong also feel a headache.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Jiang knows, has classmate Yingying made any new friends recently?" At this time, Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is Sun Rong asking about the Thousand-Faced Man.</p>

    <p>If Marshal Jiang cares about Jiang Yingying, he might know something.</p>

    <p>"A new friend? I'm not sure." Marshal Jiang stroked his chin: "She did go out for coffee with a classmate wearing your 60 High School uniform a while ago. I was right behind her. Fortunately that kid didn't do anything out of the ordinary. It saved his life."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong fell silent again.</p>

    <p>She didn't think the Man of Many Faces was so smart.</p>

    <p>Actually pretending to be a classmate directly in front of Marshal Jiang. It's really incredible...</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with Rongrong? Is there any difficulty?"</p>

    <p>"No. Uncle Jiang, it's your favor. I will definitely help. Don't worry."</p>

    <p>"That's it!" Marshal Jiang smiled. Then he asked Sun Rong to open her palm and carved a talisman on her palm.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"This is the door opener for Yingying's side of the house. Rongrong, you must help me to find a reliable person."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Uncle Jiang, I will take care of it." Sun Rong agreed with a smile.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Marshal Jiang finished explaining the matter and left, Sun Rong fell into deep thought again.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, Marshal Jiang hoped that she would find someone unknown to Jiang Yingying to protect Jiang Yingying's safety.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the people found by Marshal Jiang will be spotted and driven away. So he turned a corner and found himself.</p>

    <p>To be honest. Sun Rong feels that Jiang Yingying is quite naive in a sense.</p>

    <p>Such a big man makes the elders fearful.</p>

    <p>But there is a relationship between ancestors. Since it is Marshal Jiang's personal entrustment, it is naturally impossible for her to refuse.</p>

    <p>Of course. Sun Rong cannot really take action in this matter personally.</p>

    <p>So after careful consideration, she found the most suitable candidate...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So, when Jiugong Liangzi appeared at the door of Jiang Yingying's house with the talisman handed over by Sun Rong, she was filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>She wants to return the favor to Sun Rong. Of course she has to do this favor.</p>

    <p>Even though I just said I didn't want to come, I still came.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Jiang Yingying and Sun Rong are still in the confrontation stage.</p>

    <p>So when facing Jiugong Liangzi, Jiang Yingying's attitude became more polite.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi came over personally and took the initiative to express his goodwill to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, you can better understand Jiang Yingying's thoughts. On the other hand, you can also provide some protection within your ability.</p>

    <p>"Miss, this is it." Junko Zhongchun followed Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>"Hmm. Have you bought it from across the street?"</p>

    <p>"We bought it. The landlord didn't agree at first. But we offered a price three times higher than the market price. He immediately knelt down."</p>

    <p>"very good."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded.</p>

    <p>Yes. The Jiugong family has bought the house opposite Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>In the future, some of Jiugong Liangzi's bodyguards will be arranged to live here.</p>

    <p>Ostensibly disguised as Jiugong's staff dormitory.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is used to protect Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>In Jiang Yingying's stereotyped thinking, the Jiugong family has nothing to do with Sun Rong and has no contact with Marshal Jiang, so she would not have thought that these people were here to protect her.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi also opened the door and entered the house directly using the talisman handed over by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Why is it so dark..."</p>

    <p>"You're going to rest at this point?" Jiugong Liangzi pursed his lips. He suddenly felt that Jiang Yingying's routine was chaotic.</p>

    <p>She was not polite at all. She walked over and opened Jiang Yingying's bedroom door. She found that Jiang Yingying was sleeping under the quilt.</p>

    <p>"This girl... doesn't even know when someone is in the house." Jiugong Liangzi held her forehead.</p>

    <p>She was about to wake Jiang Yingying up.</p>

    <p>And at that moment. There's movement at the door again...</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone else coming besides us?" Jiugong Liangzi's hand paused.</p>

    <p>"No more. Miss."</p>

    <p>"Interesting. Maybe it's a break-in." Jiugong Liangzi hummed: "Then Miss. I'll play with this guy."</p>

    <p>She said. She withdrew her hand. Giving up on the idea of waking up Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>About to hide under the bed with Junko Zhongchun.</p>

    <p>It turned out that she had just lifted the bedclothes.</p>

    <p>I happened to see two uncles, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui, lying neatly underneath...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi, Junko Zhongchun: "..."</p>
