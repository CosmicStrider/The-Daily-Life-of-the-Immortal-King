  <h1>Chapter 1985 Precaution</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone has their fifteen minutes of fame. They rise to fame at a young age and then fall to rock bottom in an instant. They are about to face the situation of being banned by Xue Zang. This gap is probably not something that one person can bear in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qu Shuling is locked up in the student apartment. It is difficult to even go out. There are four soul guards in the Nascent Soul stage in the corridor. They were directly sent by Jiutian Jingmi Institute to monitor him.</p>

    <p>From now on for a long time, he may be locked in his student apartment and under official supervision.</p>

    <p>He can access the Internet, but all social networks are under surveillance. As for the social accounts, they have already been taken over by Jingmi Institute. Qu Shuling himself cannot post any information on them.</p>

    <p>This was almost the same as being imprisoned. Qu Shuling didn't know what he had done wrong. He just wanted to prove his strength in the trial of the spirit world.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, after this trial, he would become the abandoned child abandoned by the speed of light...</p>

    <p>He browsed the major social platforms. Even though he saw that many of his fans were supporting him, Qu Shuling knew very well that under such pressure, his years of accumulation would eventually be wiped out bit by bit.</p>

    <p>The shelf life of an idol is always short. As long as someone replaces him, that person will soon be focused in a new light, and his past will be buried in the haze forever.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, he is like a helpless mantis, locked in his own cage. There is no way.</p>

    <p>In a year of despair, Qu Shuling suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from the door of the apartment.</p>

    <p>There was a hint of surprise and embarrassment in the voices of those spiritual guards.</p>

    <p>"This...Principal Dai. Why are you here?"</p>

    <p>"What? You are locking up my students. Can't I come and visit?"</p>

    <p>"This is not a problem. It's just that we need Mr. Qu to cooperate with the investigation for the time being. And we are also acting under orders. Otherwise, I'm afraid it will be difficult for Mr. Teng to explain."</p>

    <p>"Teng Luchen, right... don't use him to pressure me! If the old man was guarding the door in person, I would definitely not come. But who told the old man not to guard himself? I will send a few of you here. If you can scare me, who?"</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun chuckled: "Don't worry. I won't make it difficult for you. It only takes fifteen minutes. Just let me have a few words with him."</p>

    <p>As he said that, he took out a thermos filled with food and dishes from his storage bag: "You are keeping my student locked up. You must let my student eat something good. It only lasts for one meal."</p>

    <p>After a few words, the four spirit guards looked at each other with confusion on their expressions.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, one of them took a step forward. He looked at Dai Tianchun, bowed and said, "It's only fifteen minutes. I hope Principal Dai won't make it difficult for us."</p>

    <p>"This is natural. I always keep my word." Dai Tianchun showed a sly smile.</p>

    <p>After watching Crazy Demon Dai enter the door, the leading spiritual guard finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"Captain, are we doing this against the rules? What if Teng Lao blames us?" A spiritual guard couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Do you think Mr. Teng didn't expect this?" The captain sighed: "Our job is just to take care of you. There is no need to create extraneous matters. As long as Principal Dai does not take Qu Shuling away directly, everything is easy to talk about. And It is impossible for him to take him away directly. In that case, he will be even less able to protect Qu Shuling. Mr. Teng is protecting our Zhou Quan."</p>

    <p>"..." That was all he said. The other three spirit guards all gasped.</p>

    <p>The implication is that if they were worried just now, with Dai Tianchun's temper, they would probably use strong methods to score a goal...</p>

    <p>Others can't do this. But this is not necessarily the case for Dai Crazy Devil.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This weekend is destined to become unquiet...</p>

    <p>Wang LingWalk on the garden path on campus. Listen to the discussions coming from the alumni around you.</p>

    <p>Because of Jin Deng's words and the "big memory technique" secretly imposed by Wang Ling, everyone's memories have been blurred.</p>

    <p>No one is bothered by the question of who opened the challenge letter.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone's eyes were focused on the upcoming duel between the principals.</p>

    <p>To be honest, many people have no idea.</p>

    <p>After all, the one sent by Shengke was the principal. And the deputy principal of their Number 60 High School, Huo, had just taken over not long ago.</p>

    <p>A term that lasts less than half a year...</p>

    <p>We have to fight on behalf of the honor of Number 60 High School. This sounds a little too hasty.</p>

    <p>Of course Wang Ling knows that he has a big hand in this. But Youdao is a fan of the authorities. If it hadn't been for Sun Rong this time... he might still be playing the role of a replica of Li Changzhe because of Talisman's bug.</p>

    <p>However, the new version of Talisman can indeed bring him an unprecedented sense of stability. Such a sense of solidity is indeed something that the regular Talisman cannot achieve.</p>

    <p>There is no other way. We have to take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong over there. He will find another way to express his gratitude.</p>

    <p>Illuminated toffee or something. Sun Rong already has a few sacks there. Wang Ling hasn't decided yet what to give.</p>

    <p>"Is that Vice Principal Huo really reliable? He is the Vice Principal who suddenly transferred to our school. Can he understand the school motto and background of our Sixty Years?"</p>

    <p>"Look at what you said. I don't think this is the key at all! The key lies in Vice Principal Huo versus Principal Dai from Shengke. What is the winning rate?"</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, only the principal of Shengke came in person this time?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. Their scientific magic weapon is very mature. And they have a data pagoda in their hands. I heard that it contains not only the data of all the students from other schools that Shengke pays attention to, but also the data of the teachers!"</p>

    <p>"So what you mean is..."</p>

    <p>"I want to say that maybe someone from Shengke has infiltrated our school. The origin of Vice Principal Huo is too mysterious. Assuming that the data pagoda is not included, then according to Shengke's always rigorous style, it would be better to send someone to test in advance. It's not impossible."</p>

    <p>"You have such a big brain. Go write a novel!"</p>

    <p>Several sixty-year-old alumni wearing the same school uniforms were talking in a small corner of the garden.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only heard it from a distance. But after chewing it carefully, he felt that this conjecture was not completely unreasonable.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he himself couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the hell Number 60 High School did to make it so old...</p>

    <p>It seems that since I transferred to Number 60 High School, Number 60 High School has always been in trouble. Even if there are peaceful days, I can't live in peace for a few days.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is that those who are looking for trouble feel like they have been slapped down. They come to Number 60 High School one by one to look for trouble... for fear that they will live too long.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, he hates the feeling that his life is being peeped at all the time. During the half semester of studying and living at Sixty, he has already regarded this place as his second home.</p>

    <p>So since it is your own home, you will naturally not tolerate outsiders coveting this place all the time.</p>

    <p>After listening to the words of the alumni just now, Wang Ling suddenly felt that it is indeed necessary to strengthen vigilance at this stage.</p>

    <p>It would be most appropriate to leave this matter to Heavenly Dao, who was the new chief security officer of Number 60 High School at the time...</p>
