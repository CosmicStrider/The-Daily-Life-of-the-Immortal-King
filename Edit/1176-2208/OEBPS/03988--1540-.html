  <h1>Chapter 1540 The Crisis of Zheng</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling watched Zheng leave with Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is about 1.85 meters tall. He was easily lifted by Zheng's arm...</p>

    <p>Even the soul has weight.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's cultivation level is not good enough compared to Wang Ling, but his soul is still very heavy.</p>

    <p>Zheng was carrying him like a chick. And Zheng himself was more like a hen protecting the chick.</p>

    <p>The picture in front of me couldn't help but make Wang Ling fall into deep thought.</p>

    <p>This strong sense of déjà vu made him sigh.</p>

    <p>This fight with Zheng was an accident.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling was also surprised that Wang Ling was able to obtain the black stone he had longed for so easily.</p>

    <p>Although the process was full of twists and turns, at least the results were within expectations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the black box in his hand. He stared at the dark Immaterial Stone inside. Chaos energy surged inside. It was extremely powerful.</p>

    <p>The same as before. Wang Ling's King's Eyes cannot see through the nature of this Immaterial Stone.</p>

    <p>And. Wang Ling can clearly feel that his strength has been greatly suppressed by the suppression of Immaterial Stone.</p>

    <p>But I mean it's huge.</p>

    <p>Even if suppressed. Wang Ling is still very strong.</p>

    <p>As for this black box, it is specially made by Zheng.</p>

    <p>It has the ability to block Immaterial Stone radiation.</p>

    <p>In general, Immaterial Stone has the effect that Wang Ling wants to have.</p>

    <p>But it cannot be activated directly yet.</p>

    <p>Because the radiation from Immaterial Stone is too intense.</p>

    <p>With the black box open, not only could it radiate to itself, but even the monk next to him, Jingbai, felt a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Not long after, Jingbai actually separated automatically under the radiation of this Immaterial Stone.</p>

    <p>It transformed back into the sword body and scabbard of the peach wood sword.</p>

    <p>Whether it was Jingke or Bai Qiao, their faces were obviously ugly and pale at this time, as if they had just been seriously ill.</p>

    <p>"danger..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling quickly closed the black box again. Only then did everyone around feel relieved. They felt a lot more relaxed.</p>

    <p>The radiation intensity of this Immaterial Stone is too strong.</p>

    <p>Don't talk about yourself.</p>

    <p>Even Jingbai and the monk's level of combat power can feel a sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>If this were enabled on Earth.</p>

    <p>Just this egg-sized Immaterial Stone can probably kill many cultivators on Earth...</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming wants to study "Immaterial Stone" next. I'm afraid he has to start with the "black box" that blocks the radiation of Immaterial Stone.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ming's ability.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks he can definitely do it.</p>

    <p>At this moment. In this world.</p>

    <p>Zheng. And Peng Xiren's aura has completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>They broke away from the shackles of the other world.</p>

    <p>The monk frowned. He felt vaguely uncomfortable: "Has Ling Zhenren also felt it..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng has always been sensitive.</p>

    <p>Especially for some speculations on "fate."</p>

    <p>He felt that Zheng would suffer disaster if he went back with Peng Xiren this time.</p>

    <p>Injured state. He also lost two pieces of chaos equipment that could be used to save his life.</p>

    <p>This is the time when Zheng is at its weakest.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren certainly didn't expect that his master had disappeared for so long. In the end, his master's dharma-like creature actually still existed independently.</p>

    <p>On the combat power in its heyday. Peng Xiren is by no means Zheng's opponent.</p>

    <p>But now that I'm injured, it's hard to say.</p>

    <p>Because there is Fenmu Shen over there in Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never been a nosy person.</p>

    <p>But it's exactly what the monk said.</p>

    <p>Zheng exists. In fact, it is necessary.</p>

    <p>So I thought of this. Wang Ling took a few steps forward and looked at the mess on the ground.</p>

    <p>Broken Chaos Armor. The black armor has been completely cut into pieces.</p>

    <p>These fragments are quietly embedded in the earth of the other world. Like withered black rose petals, they are emitting the light before they wither completely.</p>

    <p>And some golden confetti scattered around these fragments is another mess left after the Corpse Map was "torn into pieces" by Jingbai.</p>

    <p>These two chaos devices are crucial to Zheng. Now that they are destroyed, it will greatly damage Zheng's cultivation.</p>

    <p>At this time, the King's Eyes of Wang Ling are rendered golden.</p>

    <p>"Eight-Character Method." Activate at this moment.</p>

    <p>As the three Golden Lotus in the pupils rotated clockwise, the powerful pupils overflowed, covering the mess in front of them.</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>The monk was stunned.</p>

    <p>This was the first time he saw Wang Ling perform such a trick.</p>

    <p>What surprised him even more was the pupil technique itself.</p>

    <p>"There is something and there is nothing. The reality and reality come into being..."</p>

    <p>It can actually turn reality into illusion. Illusion into reality.</p>

    <p>This... is this still an ability that humans have?</p>

    <p>The monk opened his mouth in surprise.</p>

    <p>This kind of pupil technique can make a person invincible!</p>

    <p>But before. Wang Ling had always chosen to keep a low profile. He had never sacrificed anything in front of a monk.</p>

    <p>Now Monk Jin Deng was shocked.</p>

    <p>Soon.</p>

    <p>Under the operation of pupil power, Chaos Armor and Corpse Map were both repaired.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling handed the Chaos Armor to the monk to deal with. The monk is familiar with Zheng. After knowing this time, he will always know the whereabouts of Zheng.</p>

    <p>Repair the Chaos Machine. This is not the job of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It can only be regarded as a little return gift after Zheng took the initiative to hand over the Immaterial Stone.</p>

    <p>As for the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling needs to stay and study for a while.</p>

    <p>As Zheng said before, this Supreme Corpse Map contains many ancient powerful men who were suppressed in those years.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that maybe he has a way to communicate with these powerful people from all ages, so as to further understand the secrets of the Eternal Era.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Ling Zhenren. I'll take care of this matter right away."</p>

    <p>After accepting the Chaos Armor, Jin Deng deeply understood the advantages and disadvantages of this Chaos Armor.</p>

    <p>So the next second he took a step forward.</p>

    <p>The whole person disappeared directly into the other world...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>You should be able to catch up, right?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>He looked at the messy other world and sighed silently in his heart. Then he turned back to reality.</p>

    <p>The battle just now seemed like a long time. But there's still a difference in the flow of time between the inside world and the real world.</p>

    <p>In fact. In reality, Wang Ling was just stunned.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes passed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was calmly sticking his hands in his pants pockets. Almost at the same time as Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>He deliberately delayed his time so that his breakthrough time would not appear to be too early.</p>

    <p>But what I didn't expect was that Sun Rong had the same idea as him. Even the timing was surprisingly consistent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Sun Rong and nodded to himself. He was about to come over.</p>

    <p>As a result, I was cut off by another girl on the way.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than Matsushita Singha, who was possessed by Peng Xiren before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling came to the rescue at that time. Then before leaving, he also added an illusion to tamper with Matsushita Singha's memory.</p>

    <p>Originally, Matsushita Singha and Sun Rong, who was playing "Jiugong Liangzi", were on the same page because of conflicts before the start of the game.</p>

    <p>When the two women appeared in the same picture, they also attracted a lot of attention.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought that Matsushita Singha went to declare war with Sun Rong who played "Jiugong Liangzi."</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, the girl blushed and took Sun Rong's hand. She was shy but also a little domineering and said: "Jiugong Liangzi! I... I like you!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling supports the amount.</p>

    <p>He really didn't expect that things would turn out like this...</p>
