  <h1>Chapter 1570 The Monk's Way of the Past</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Zheng woke up, he found that he and Peng Xiren were entangled with a powerful spiritual thread.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zheng! You finally woke up!" Peng Xiren shouted. There was a bit of panic on his face.</p>

    <p>He felt that his sea of consciousness exploded. It was as if something was burning and his lungs hurt. And in the center of the sea of consciousness, a huge whirlpool appeared.</p>

    <p>The whole thing was sunken. There wasn't even a drop of sea water inside.</p>

    <p>"Eh?" Zheng felt something was wrong. He was shocked to find that his memory had been tampered with.</p>

    <p>He gently placed his paw on Peng Xiren's head next to him. He found the same problem.</p>

    <p>A small part of their memory in the astrolabe was silently tampered with.</p>

    <p>It is already clear who the initiator of this incident is.</p>

    <p>"Did the monk do it?" Zheng frowned. The emotions in his heart began to become complicated.</p>

    <p>The backgammon board in front of me has not been completely played yet. The monk has disappeared. The direction of the incident is very clear.</p>

    <p>Zheng picked up a chess piece and broke it apart. A trace of past Buddha fire flowed out from the chess piece.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene Zheng, I instantly knew how Monk Jin Deng did all this.</p>

    <p>Chess pieces from the past...</p>

    <p>It turns out that the monk had already started the layout during the chess game.</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned.</p>

    <p>I don't understand why the monk did that.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was with his fingertips back then. Dao Ancestor Wang chose Peng Xiren as his true disciple.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that the monk would not have a great impression of Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>But now such a game has been set up. Using the fire of the past Buddha hidden in the chess pieces, an attempt was made to hide the fact that Peng Xiren had discovered the discovery of the tomb in the sky during the chess game.</p>

    <p>Now. Zheng totally understands.</p>

    <p>All this was done intentionally by the monk.</p>

    <p>Deliberately letting him peek into Wang Ling's spirit. Then he was overcome by the spirit and fainted.</p>

    <p>He also deliberately played chess with him, causing both him and Peng Xiren to fall into the trap.</p>

    <p>"Monk... you think I can't find it. You're looking down on me too much."</p>

    <p>Zheng showed a bitter smile.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes and counted with his fingers. The expression on his face immediately became complicated. He couldn't help but glare at Peng Xiren: "Why didn't you wake me up earlier?"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren lowered his head. He looked like a child who had made a mistake.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren has roughly understood the current situation.</p>

    <p>The monk used the past Buddha's fire to temporarily cover up the fact that "the tomb in the sky has been opened" that he discovered earlier.</p>

    <p>After the monk left, Peng Xiren thought over and over about the words the monk had said to him before he left.</p>

    <p>My body and mind began to feel frightened by Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>"That's all... I can't blame you. Who could have imagined that a monk's mind is so deep."</p>

    <p>Zheng stared at Peng Xiren. He sighed: "The monk is doing this to get rid of us. He is fighting against Fenmu Shen. This is an act of suicide! You must help him!"</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to stand up, Peng Xiren suddenly screamed: "Don't move, brother Zheng!"</p>

    <p>There was an expression of extreme pain on his face.</p>

    <p>It was because the spiritual thread entwined between the two of them was being pulled. It made Peng Xiren feel a special kind of pain.</p>

    <p>"How dare this monk..."</p>

    <p>Zheng Only then did he realize the abnormality of this spiritual thread.</p>

    <p>This is not an ordinary spiritual thread. It is a Buddhist thread that can be traced back to the soul... If the spiritual thread is torn or taken away, Peng Xiren's soul will be immediately transcended into reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Protect Peng Xiren. This was originally the task left to him by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>The monk calculated that he could not take the risk to extract silk. But Peng Xiren ignored it and forcibly left the astrolabe to help him fight...</p>

    <p>"What on earth does this monk want to do?" Zheng was furious. He overturned the chessboard on the spot with a loud crash.</p>

    <p>The Purdue Buddha Thread cannot be forcibly lifted.</p>

    <p>So now all we have to do is wait for this Buddha thread to disappear automatically...</p>

    <p>There are two prerequisites for automatic disappearance.</p>

    <p>First, the monk's spiritual power has been exhausted and he cannot maintain the power of the Buddha's thread.</p>

    <p>And the second thing is that the monk has died in battle...</p>

    <p>This is the worst situation.</p>

    <p>Previously, Zheng always wanted to drive the monk away. In fact, he also wanted to find an opportunity to reach the celestial tomb.</p>

    <p>He has even figured out how to keep the monk in his chart.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the monk took the initiative before him.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zheng. What should we do now..." Peng Xiren knew that a disaster was coming. At this moment, he really didn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>Zheng sat down cross-legged. He lowered his head and thought deeply.</p>

    <p>What to do...</p>

    <p>He doesn't know what to do either!</p>

    <p>The only thing I can do now is to sit down and shout Amitabha...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after the monk trapped Zheng and Peng Xiren in the astrolabe, he was also looking for the direction of the celestial tomb.</p>

    <p>He extracted the obscured memory of Peng Xiren and integrated it into his own sea of consciousness. He followed the clues and found the location of the tomb.</p>

    <p>This cosmic space without any stars is filled with the smell of gunpowder smoke.</p>

    <p>The monk can definitely feel that there has been a fierce battle here before.</p>

    <p>"Is it a hidden entrance?" The monk frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang hid the Celestial Tomb here. Indeed, even the monk had never thought about it. If he had not refined the memory of Peng Xiren, he would never be able to find the exact location of the Celestial Tomb in the vast infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>The monk opened his swastika and once again used the power of the Buddha's fire in the past to strengthen his eyes to observe what happened before he came here.</p>

    <p>As a result, he saw the old woman whose soul was set on fire and died in pain while screaming...</p>

    <p>"Run... run away..."</p>

    <p>The old woman roared at the top of her lungs.</p>

    <p>Along with the burning soul, it eventually turned into nothingness.</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together, recited the mantra of rebirth in his heart, and performed a salvation ceremony for the poor tombkeeper.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen is just as he thought before. Extremely cruel.</p>

    <p>He knew that the old woman's soul had been burned out and she could not enter the reincarnation ceremony... His current salvation might not have any effect.</p>

    <p>But the monk still wanted to do that.</p>

    <p>Monks have compassion as their heart. Seeking for it is a psychological comfort.</p>

    <p>"Monk. Are you the only one here?"</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, a familiar figure appeared in front of the monk.</p>

    <p>It's Fenmu Shen's voice. But... the body is not Fenmu Shen's original body.</p>

    <p>"Did you steal Xiren's body?" The monk looked at the person in front of him, his eyes slightly stunned.</p>

    <p>The person in front of me looks like Peng Xiren's delicate and handsome face, but his eye color and hair color have changed.</p>

    <p>Purple eyes, purple hair... everything is a color full of evil flavor.</p>

    <p>There is also a small horn on the forehead.</p>

    <p>"If it wasn't for the purpose of breaking the soul contract with him, I wouldn't have made such a move. But merging into his body had an unexpected benefit. It is within this celestial tomb that I can roam freely.. Dao Ancestor cannot bear to attack his precious disciple." Fenmu Shen sneered.</p>

    <p>He released his breath slightly. The monk suddenly felt a strong wind in front of him! The cassock on his body started to dance wildly in the wind. The huge pressure brought a crushing sense of oppression and he tipped forward!</p>

    <p>"It's so strong..." The monk was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>He felt like he was swaying like a tree branch in the wind.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen in his heyday. So scary!</p>

    <p>Purple evil light surged all over his body. His aura continued to rise. He was like the king of the universe overlooking the human world! The energy of chaos soared into the sky, sweeping over half of the infinite galaxy!</p>

    <p>That kind of power is beyond the monk's imagination.</p>

    <p>"Monk... you came here. Do you want to transcend yourself?"</p>

    <p>Before the monk could react, Fenmu Shen changed his figure. He teleported behind Jin Deng. He opened his hand and grabbed the monk Jin Deng's bare head.</p>

    <p>"Amitabha..." The smooth head was strangled by Fenmu Shen. The monk closed his eyes. The expression on his face was neither sad nor happy.</p>

    <p>"You don't dodge or dodge. Do you want to prove that you are tough?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen snorted.</p>

    <p>Then a huge roar exploded from his palm. The shock wave of the explosion spread to infinity. The cracks in the black space that were impacted by the power of chaos were derived! They continued to expand to the infinite galaxy with light years as the distance unit!</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that this terrifying scene, like the dawn of the universe, was created just to crush a monk's head...</p>
