  <h1>Chapter 2088 Respective headquarters</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The sword master insists on the request. Zhang Zhui is unexpected in everything. This veteran who has been on the battlefield for many years even knows that there are risks, but he still wants to be this brave rebel. His courage is still the same as before.</p>

    <p>And Zhang Zhui had an intuition that the courage in Yi Jianchuan was not reckless at all, but really confident.</p>

    <p>Suddenly he suddenly thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>That is, maybe the sword master in front of him...did not fully release the sea of spiritual power accumulated in his body when he fought against Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>There is probably some leftover!</p>

    <p>In other words, Yi Jianchuan, who has already reached the top of the holy realm, still has the possibility of climbing up again and hitting the new highest realm on earth!</p>

    <p>A stronger stimulus is needed to completely liberate it.</p>

    <p>However, Zhang Zhui knew exactly who his opponent was. It was not an ordinary danger.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan's power cannot be described in words. The other party is not a mere fish in a higher realm like Hong Siqi. He really needs to be serious. He can directly wipe out Yi Jianchuan with just a flick of his finger.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Zhang Zhui is still struggling in his heart.</p>

    <p>But at this time, within Xiao Bailong, Yue Lingwei told him through the air: "Let's go. Take one step at a time."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui originally thought that he should be more cautious. He was about to ask, but he heard Yue Lingwei continue: "This is also what the Lord ordered."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by Ling Zhenren..." Zhang Zhui was stunned. Then he sighed. He had no choice but to agree to accompany Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>"Senior, please." So he said to Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan laughed loudly when he heard this: "I don't dare to call you a senior anymore. You are the Eternal One."</p>

    <p>"Although I am the Eternal One, I am actually not that old. I have just been sealed in a magic weapon for a long time."</p>

    <p>"Has it been sealed in a magic weapon for a long time? There is a magic weapon with a difference in the passage of time? Is that why you can live from eternity to now?"</p>

    <p>"Senior, you can understand that." Zhang Zhui nodded.</p>

    <p>What he calls "senior" is actually a sign of respect for Yi Jianchuan. After all, Yi Jianchuan is now the master appointed by Wang Ling to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of Wang Ling, the little guy and Wang Ling are currently as close as brothers.</p>

    <p>Brother's teacher, so his seniority naturally goes up. Therefore, he felt that calling him Sword Master would be more respectful.</p>

    <p>"Why do you still call me senior?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan chuckled and said: "Well, you and I have our own issues. You call me and I'll call you ancestor. It doesn't seem too much. Let's do it. Ancestor may not sound nice. It's a bit like swearing. I'll just call you you. Ancestor."</p>

    <p>"Senior, please come here..."</p>

    <p>"Ancestor, please also."</p>

    <p>The two looked at each other and smiled awkwardly. They greeted each other. Suddenly, the atmosphere at the scene fell into a happy atmosphere.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A battle was unavoidable in the restricted sea area. However, Qiao Yanyuan's move behind his back dispersed the fleet of ships. The monks from all the major cultivation countries were also thrown far away by Zhang Zhui to a safe range.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is very clear. Even so, they will not back down. Every monk in the Xiuzhen Kingdom comes under the orders of his own Yuan Zun. Even if they know there are risks, they cannot just become deserters.</p>

    <p>At present, everyone knows that there are risks in the sea zone. But the sword master has already set off. Those cultivators who are the leaders will not give up just like this.</p>

    <p>Maybe Wang Ling doesn't know much about Huaxiu Yuan Zun. But he knows a little bit about the temper of Mixiu Yuan Zun from the news.</p>

    <p>In the past, I always liked to add spiritual stone tax. He has a pure business mind and a relatively impulsive personality. As long as his subordinates are provoked, he will red-necked and order to rush directly.</p>

    <p>Of course, he himself now also likes to provoke others. For example, he provokes a conflict between one cultivation country and another cultivation country. Behind his back, he sells new cultivation magic tools to two cultivation countries. At the same time, he acts as a good person from the perspective of outsiders. Image. Maintain a gentle and elegant posture and say something like wishing for world peace.</p>

    <p>Since then, money has been put into the pockets and the GDP of the entire cultivation country has been improved. At the same time, he has also added his own personality with the label of "Ambassador of Peace."</p>

    <p>It's also ironic to say.</p>

    <p>It seems that all the previous Mixiu Yuan Zuns have tried to establish a peaceful image for themselves. But since the founding of Mixiu Country, almost 70% of the time has been spent at war for hundreds of years.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling feels that Misu Yuan Zun is an impulsive person, and usually needs to listen to his words and watch his actions. Because he often contradicts his words and cannot be trusted.</p>

    <p>All in all, I believe you. You are such a bad old man...</p>

    <p>Obviously the person who truly hopes for world peace is himself...</p>

    <p>People are investigating the affairs of the ancestors of the Sun family on one side of their ancestral land. They also worry about the restricted sea area on the other side.</p>

    <p>From Yi Jianchuan's perspective, this is a showdown between the major cultivating countries, witnessing the courage of the monks from each country.</p>

    <p>But from the perspective of Wang Ling. In fact, we are actually on one side of the game.</p>

    <p>On one side is himself in the ancestral land of the Sun family. On the other side is Qiao Yanyuan, who is controlling everything on the Moonlight in the restricted area.</p>

    <p>These two coordinate points are separated by a radius of the earth. They form two distinct command posts. They are competing secretly and echoing each other from afar.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Yun was so suppressed by Wang Ling that he completely lost his temper. He observed Wang Ling for a long time. As one of the miracles of the universe, the young man in front of him just sat cross-legged in front of him. But he could not see through it at all.</p>

    <p>His cultivation is unfathomable. Just sitting upright, he creates a powerful aura that unites heaven and man. This heavenly man does not refer to the sky of the earth, but to the sky of the universe. Let Wang Ling be related to the entire universe The two merged into one. It was so mysterious that Heavenly Dao Yun was crushed directly and couldn't breathe.</p>

    <p>He is the cosmic miracle that Dao Ancestor Wang buried here. Dao Ancestor told him back then that if he encounters someone who can suppress him, he should hug his thigh quickly. Otherwise, he will lose if he hesitates.</p>

    <p>"I am willing to...surrender!"</p>

    <p>So he gritted his teeth. It was almost the same as the cosmic miracle tree on the other side that he had forced himself on before.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling is ashamed.</p>

    <p>His trip to the ancestral land of the Sun family really felt like traveling westward.</p>

    <p>Passing through a map will give you one more teammate.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, there are miracles in the universe that are willing to take the initiative to approach. Cultivators can only ask for it. www.uukanshu.net But Wang Ling looked at the Heavenly Dao Yun villain in front of him. His expressionless face was full of tears. It's all disgusting.</p>

    <p>"Hey..." he sighed.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Yun was stunned by this sigh.</p>

    <p>He had never been so disliked by anyone. He immediately squatted down with his legs crossed and drew circles with a depressed face.</p>

    <p>"Good guy. The Heavenly Dao cloud has turned into a net suppressing cloud!" At this time, the groundhog said with emotion.</p>

    <p>"I can't just accept you."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling raised his head and looked at the Heavenly Dao cloud.</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ling suddenly thought of.</p>

    <p>If you want to join his family, you can't do it without some testing.</p>

    <p>We have to let Heavenly Dao Cloud do something...</p>
