  <h1>Chapter 2110 Itinerant Immortal Child Magic Ring</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The {Itinerant Immortal} is an open world game developed by Bai Qiao. After adding the holographic mode, all players who enter the game can carry out basic transformations based on their own image. That is Shape your face on your own.</p>

    <p>However, in order to avoid too large a gap with the real image, the player's face information and height data are almost fixed values. Only the values that match the basic facial features can be fine-tuned. The value adjustment authority does not exceed 0.5.</p>

    <p>As for changes in body shape, there are not so many restrictions.</p>

    <p>So after the holographic cabin collected the facial data of Mr. Zanghu, a furry fox head appeared in the game world...</p>

    <p>This situation made Mr. Zanghu sigh. He was used to it. But this game was so real that it made him feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>A virtual game world. In order to pursue a stronger sense of immersion, many manufacturers usually spend a lot of effort on the face pinching process. But this Bai Qiao one is a bit original. It directly scans the face. It almost restores your original facial features data. Faces reveal their true appearance directly in the game.</p>

    <p>"Why is it like this? Is it just to improve the sense of reality?" Mr. Zanghu was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Of course not." Soon, a voice came from his mind. It was Wang Ming's voice.</p>

    <p>During the entire game, Wang Ming will provide all-round guidance to Mr. Zanghu outside. He can realize the voice directly in his mind.</p>

    <p>"{Itinerant Immortal" is an open-ended game that is still in the inner stage. A very important label in it is making friends."</p>

    <p>"Making friends..."</p>

    <p>"In other words, keep the facial features data as real as possible. At least people who can look at each other will not feel much difference when they meet offline."</p>

    <p>"I see. Do you want to date someone by looking at your face while playing a game?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu laughed. He thought this design was really ridiculous: "It can be an open world. It must be participated by players from all over the world. Online dating is inherently a trap. Coupled with long-distance love, it should be impossible, right?"</p>

    <p>"Coordinate display will be enabled during the public beta. Eh... If you are really interested in this aspect, you can only communicate with players in the same city."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied: "The modern world of cultivation is open and inclusive. As long as you can see the right person, increase the marriage rate. Then increase the promotion rate of the new generation of monks. Online dating is also feasible."</p>

    <p>"But this is only theoretically possible..."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zanghu is right to say that. But this is also a helpless move. You are a popular science scholar. You also study history. Maybe you don't know much about games. Let me ask. Do you know how difficult it is to apply for a game license now? ?"</p>

    <p>"Have the exchange been reviewed? I understand."</p>

    <p>When Mr. Zanghu heard this, he couldn't help but laugh bitterly.</p>

    <p>The conversation between the two people was also heard by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That's right. In fact, Wang Ling is also paying attention to the progress of this game.</p>

    <p>Not only could he hear the conversation between the two, but he could also clearly understand Mr. Zanghu's actions.</p>

    <p>The key is. He has also logged into the game...</p>

    <p>I connected directly to the Internet from the Office of Strategic Deception. Moreover, it was still together with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Considering that Chen Chao, Guo Hao and the others have not yet come out of the mountain of retrospection, Wang Ling and Sun Rong also decided to join the game in secret. By the way, they would see if they could secretly provide Mr. Zanghu with whatever they could. of help.</p>

    <p>These two game cabins were moved directly to Lord Diulei's Office of Strategic Deception. No one knows what Wang Ling and Sun Rong are doing in the office at the moment...</p>

    <p>... Gu Scandium</p>

    <p>After synchronizing the facial and body data, the next step is career selection.</p>

    <p>Yes. {Itinerant Immortal Child Magic Ring} has professions. Although it also incorporates the concept of cultivation. However, the initial basic attribute distribution, starting money, and specialties of each profession are different.</p>

    <p>Ancient heavy-armored monk, immortal sword, country man, thief, stargazer, reborn, mechanic, sealer, regretter, loser.</p>

    <p>The top ten professions. They were all designed by Bai Qiao. Each profession has an attribute focus. It is divided into five basic attributes: strength, agility, intelligence, defense, and luck.</p>

    <p>For those new to this type of game, [Ancient Heavy Armored Monk] is naturally the first choice. It comes with a high health value of 200 points.</p>

    <p>Among the five major attributes, basic strength and agility are both very high. Strength determines the damage value. And agility determines the accuracy and attack speed of melee attacks.</p>

    <p>And [Sword Immortal] is a profession that mainly focuses on agility. In terms of weapon selection, when wearing sword weapons, whether it is a two-handed sword, one-handed sword or a giant sword, the Immortal Sword has additional blessings.</p>

    <p>These are two professions that are more suitable for novices.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look at the detailed career introduction.</p>

    <p>I found that the remaining professions also have their own characteristics.</p>

    <p>[Rural Rough Man]: The distribution of attributes is relatively even. The advantage is that it comes with a spiritual beast at the beginning. It can be chosen from the small griffon, the small spiritual dog, and the small spiritual elephant. It is available for players to choose.</p>

    <p>The initial attributes of the spirit beasts are different. The little spirit beast is the weakest, the little spirit elephant is the strongest. The little spirit dog is relatively in the middle. But the stronger the starting spirit beast means that it also requires the consumption of materials. If you don't have enough experience. It's easy to feed your spiritual beasts to death.</p>

    <p>According to the settings, the basic attributes of the little spirit elephant are the highest at the beginning. At the same time, it is easy to be killed. But if it can grow up later, it can also be used as a mount.</p>

    <p>[Thief]: A special attribute with three points of luck at the beginning. It is said that Bai Qiao designed it based on Zhang Zhui. Choosing this profession is purely based on luck. The initial equipment is also very average. To put it bluntly, everything depends on "Bai" visit a prostitute."</p>

    <p>Of course. Because there are punishment measures for "thieves" in the game. If you are caught by mistake, you will easily be beaten to death by the crowd...</p>

    <p>In the previous closed beta, according to Bai Qiao, there were many playful people in the open world who chose this profession after completing the closed beta. They all achieved the achievement of "being physically disabled but strong in spirit."</p>

    <p>[Stargazer Taoist]: A profession that combines Taoist background. It has a whisk. It can be used to cast spells from a distance. It starts with three points of intelligence.</p>

    <p>[Reborn]: A profession with balanced strength and intelligence. At the same time, there is a fragment of the world map in the hand. It has a memory at the beginning. It can completely see a certain corner of the world and the distribution status of spiritual beasts. And learn about the possibilities in the illuminated map. Useful resources exist.</p>

    <p>However, the game world is too big. Choose a reborn person at the beginning. You may not necessarily fall directly into the illuminated map.</p>

    <p>At that time, the data that the reborn person selected at the beginning of the closed beta directly transferred to the illuminated map was 2%.</p>

    <p>All in all. is a career that is not recommended for novices.</p>

    <p>[Mechanic]: A master of wisdom. The prototype of the character is Wang Ming himself. He randomly has a modern weapon at the beginning. In the subsequent plot, he can be transformed into various modern professions according to the needs of the plot. Such as Huan Daxi Lingyang Mechanical Mecha Engineer. Or... Breaking Bad!</p>

    <p>[Sealer] A master of agility and intelligence. Full of unknowns and surprises. He carries a broken ancient scroll. You need to collect the key to open the ancient scroll during the game to develop more new things.</p>

    <p>[Repenter] is the only profession that starts with all agility attributes. His background is that he is a monk who is constantly being hunted by his ex-wife or husband because he broke off the engagement. Therefore, his agility is very high. It is extremely difficult!</p>

    <p>According to the data results provided by Bai Qiao, during a round of internal testing, a female player directly attacked her ex-husband. This caused a direct two-level reversal in the subsequent plot. It was equivalent to adopting her ex-husband as her own pet.</p>

    <p>Looking at these career introductions. Wang Ling sighed silently. In the end, I chose the last [waste]...</p>
