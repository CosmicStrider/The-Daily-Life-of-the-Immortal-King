  <h1>Chapter 2011 Help Sun Rong improve their realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Cang Long and Liu Yong have no idea about the secret cultivation realm of the Mountain of Recall. They only know that this secret realm was arranged for them by Lord Diulei. And their mission these days is to help Chen Chao and Liu Yong before the Earth Center Project. Guo Hao conducts devilish training so that they can break through to the early stage of Golden Core as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Of course, the distance between the peak of the later stage of Foundation Building and the early stage of Golden Core seems to be just a piece of window paper. However, the progress between realms is always a threshold. It is far from easy to cross.</p>

    <p>The so-called master guides the individual to practice. It is also very important to have a master with past experience.</p>

    <p>In front of the last teleportation circle, Zhuo Yi stopped and introduced to Cang Long and Liu Yong: "This is the secret cultivation realm provided by Zhenjun. You need to enter it in batches. Practice in the secret realm. Don't pay too much attention to time. There are actuarial equipment in the secret realm. It will automatically leave the secret realm as long as there is time."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Cang Long and Liu Yong both nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is just the official statement from Zhuo Yi. After all, the time flow rate in the Mountain of Recall is completely different. The only way to leave the secret realm this time is that only Chen Chao and Guo Hao can successfully break through to the early stage of the Golden Core. They will be allowed to leave.</p>

    <p>As for the issue of energy supply, there is no need to worry. The ecological mechanism in the secret realm will be refreshed every once in a while. Many spiritual fruits and spiritual beasts that can be hunted will appear randomly.</p>

    <p>Of course. There will also be random treasure chest rewards on the map. There are a wealth of natural and earthly treasures that can be used to break through the realm.</p>

    <p>What Chen Chao and Guo Hao have to do is rely on the wild survival experience of the two masters Cang Long and Liu Yong. Use the most primitive methods to make use of these resources. On the one hand, they can increase their realm strength. On the other hand, it can also help them. Improve your experience of surviving in the wild.</p>

    <p>After all, the game mode for the Earth Center Project in one week will also be an adventure in the inner earth world. Although the adventure area has already been accurately calculated by the academies of science of various countries, the safety factor has been ensured.</p>

    <p>But after all, no one has really gone deep into the inner earth world. No one can predict what kind of dangers they will encounter in the inner earth world.</p>

    <p>Maybe the strength of the spiritual beasts in the inner earth world can no longer be measured by the realm strength of the spiritual beasts on the surface. Everything is unknown to those who are new to the inner earth world.</p>

    <p>"Then I will go in with my disciple first." Canglong is huge. Standing next to Chen Chao, he looks like a black bear that has been enlarged several times. Chen Chao's figure is already considered strong. And standing next to Chen Chao is In front of Canglong, only four words can be used to describe Xiaojiabiyu.</p>

    <p>He said confidently while laughing loudly, as rough as ever. Then he directly lifted Chen Chao's clothes and stood in the center of the magic circle as if he was carrying a kitten.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, along with a blue teleportation light, the two of them disappeared into the light curtain together.</p>

    <p>"This guy Canglong is still so resolute. We can break through the peak of Foundation Building in the later stage. We don't need to be so tired. We can break through." Liu Yong laughed. His movements were slow and slow. He was completely different from Canglong. Standing in front of the law In the center of the formation, I was still discussing with Guo Hao what we were going to eat later.</p>

    <p>"Today is our first day as master and apprentice. It is also an anniversary. Later, master will show you his outdoor cooking skills. Have you ever had a spiritual insect feast?"</p>

    <p>"It's the kind with the head removed and it's all protein!"</p>

    <p>"It is not only protein, but also rich in trace elements. According to the theory of dietary supplements, it is helpful to break through the later peak of Foundation Building."</p>

    <p>"Master's craftsmanship must be perfect!"</p>

    <p>The two communicated like this. Then they disappeared into the blue light.</p>

    <p>After Chen Chao and Guo Hao were all sent away, the remaining people breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The rest are basically our own people, so there is no need to be too formal about the next conversation.</p>

    <p>"It's really hard for everyone this time. In order to make it seamless, we also asked everyone to cooperate in this play." Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"Everything Senior Zhuo said should be done.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing crossed his arms and said with a smile: "By the way. What are the plans for the next step?" For the sake of caution, I hope everyone will stay in the Office of Strategic Deception during the few days Chen Chao and Guo Hao are practicing. After all, we still have to gather in the end. Get up. So as not to expose any flaws. I have arranged a room for everyone above the True Venerated Immortal Hall. All facilities in the Office of Strategic Deception. Everyone is free to visit and come in and out."</p>

    <p>"I won't go. I'm also very interested in the Mountain of Recall. Can I go in and have a look?" Fang Xing asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course. Space layering has been set up inside. Don't disturb each other."</p>

    <p>"What about coming out?"</p>

    <p>"Just recite Lord Diulei silently in your heart, just like the law."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Fang Xing nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's just a matter of waking up to your realm..."</p>

    <p>"Now that the earth has been upgraded, my True Immortal realm is still not enough. Improving my cultivation is a never-ending task. I don't want to hold back."</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing said that, he crossed his arms and walked into the magic circle alone. Before leaving, he still kept the familiar smile that Wang Ling had always seen on his face: "Well, everyone, I'll see you later."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although Fang Xing inherited the Snake Skin True Immortal tradition, his talent in cultivation is still terrifying.</p>

    <p>What's more terrifying than genius is a genius who works hard...</p>

    <p>The Mountain of Retrospection is a place that automatically matches the cultivation environment according to the realm of the person who enters it. In other words, all the spiritual beasts Fang Xing encounters there are at the True Immortal realm level. With Fang Xing's cultivation talent, he might be immersed in it. Maybe you can actually reach an unexpected level after practicing for a few days.</p>

    <p>Of course. If a strong person brings a weaker person in, like a master-disciple combination like Canglong and Chen Chao, the Mountain of Recall will also adjust the difficulty of the environment suitable for the two people to practice based on their realm strength.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fang Xing went in to practice alone. What Zhuo Yi didn't expect was that the others also got involved.</p>

    <p>"Well. We also want to go practice." To Zhuo Yi's surprise, Liu Qingyi directly took Wang Zhen's hand and walked straight into the magic circle.</p>

    <p>Obviously. Judging from the confused expression on Wang Zhen's face, he seemed to be completely unprepared mentally: "Ah. Qingyi... we also have to practice?"</p>

    <p>"Of course! If we don't practice, our God's Domain will lose face. We will soon be overtaken by cultivators on Earth!" Liu Qingyi looked at him: "Why, do you have any objections?"</p>

    <p>"No...no..." Wang Zhen couldn't laugh or cry. Ever since he fell in love with Liu Qingyi, he seemed to have been on the weaker side.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is speechless.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that these days, cultivation matters could be involved.</p>

    <p>He had already planned a follow-up date with Jiugong Liangzi. But Liu Qingyi dragged Wang Zhen in. Jiugong Liangzi couldn't sit still: "Ah! Zhuo Yi! I think we should go in to practice as well. alright!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Anyway... if you take me out on a date, it means eating and watching a movie. It's so boring. It's not as fun as practicing. I think the mechanism of the Mountain of Recall is much more interesting!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, she took Zhuo Yi's hand and entered the circle directly without waiting for Zhuo Yi's response. Before leaving, she secretly winked at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Now. Sun Rong finally understands the meaning of the wave of involution practice that everyone suddenly started...</p>

    <p>This is obviously to create opportunities for her and Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Let's go."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly heard the familiar young figure ringing next to his ears.</p>

    <p>This time she didn't even have time to react. She didn't expect that Wang Ling would actually take the initiative to speak.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had already thought about it carefully before going back to the mountain of retrospect.</p>

    <p>Nine-core Aohai. After all, he was the one who gave it to Sun Rong in the first place. So in that case, he might as well send the Buddha to the West...</p>

    <p>Originally, he wanted to appoint someone to help train Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But now everyone has left completely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no choice but to do it himself.</p>

    <p>It just helps Sun Rong break through to the peak in the later stages of the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this time, he will be the teacher.</p>

    <p>It shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
