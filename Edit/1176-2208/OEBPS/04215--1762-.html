  <h1>Chapter 1762 Tengu Scavenger</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu's appearance was a huge surprise to both Wang Ling and Sun Rong. But now Wang Ling has also discovered that this little guy is smarter than he thought.</p>

    <p>If a friendly relationship can be established, the little guy may be able to follow the same path as Zhuo Yi and take responsibility for him.</p>

    <p>Not long after Martial Saint Jiang left, Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong followed closely from the other side.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew this was not the place to talk. He took Wang Ling, Wang Muyu and Zhou Ziyi into a van marked with the emblem of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Almost as soon as the door was closed, Zhou Ziyi saw Wang Muyu's body change. He turned into the appearance of a six-year-old child again. Then he threw himself into Wang Ling's arms and rubbed his head against Wang Ling. The fabric in Wang Ling's arms.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because this little guy has the same face as me. Wang Ling actually held back for a moment and didn't slap him away.</p>

    <p>After all. To fight yourself.</p>

    <p>It seems a bit excessive.</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong felt envious in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, he also wanted to rub into his master's arms like this... Unfortunately, he didn't have the courage. And he was very afraid that he would be kicked out by Wang Ling if he did such a thing.</p>

    <p>Looking at the scene in front of him, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but sigh. This is really a privilege... Everyone who sees it will envy it.</p>

    <p>Even his Master's Wife wanted it, but a child got in first.</p>

    <p>As the chief disciple of Zhuo Yi, it was only at this moment that Zhou Ziyi realized that this young man was the legendary little dragon Wang Muyu...</p>

    <p>He did not dare to look directly at the warm scene of "family reunion" behind the car. He looked directly through the rearview mirror in the middle of the car and saw part of Wang Muyu's face.</p>

    <p>Even though he could only see part of his face, Zhou Ziyi was stunned because Wang Muyu and his Wang Ling master were so similar!</p>

    <p>No wonder he heard what his master Zhuo Yi said. The master had a headache about this matter. Now when he saw it, Zhou Ziyi suddenly realized it.</p>

    <p>He is obviously not his own child. He is not even related by blood. But he has a face that is very similar to his own... Who can tell clearly?</p>

    <p>You don't necessarily need to tell others. Wang Muyu is a branch of the Dragon Clan, right?</p>

    <p>The little guy hesitated for a while. Finally, he looked up at Wang Ling: "Dad...my performance this time. Wasn't it pretty good?"</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling's pair of dead fish eyes. Not only was he not afraid at all, but he also showed starry eyes. It was a gesture asking for praise.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this scene and was silent for a long time. Because he was clumsy, he didn't know how to praise someone correctly. Although he really seemed to want to praise Wang Muyu, but at the same time he was afraid that if he would really praise him, this little guy The guy will start floating.</p>

    <p>So, after careful consideration, Wang Ling reached out his hand and gently pat the little guy's head.</p>

    <p>Being pat by Wang Ling made Wang Muyu elated. He seemed even happier than receiving praise.</p>

    <p>He hugged Wang Ling's muscular waist tightly. Like a koala, he refused to come down.</p>

    <p>Finally, Zhuo Yi came to the rescue. He took the initiative to coordinate with Wang Muyu: "Little Muyu, you have to stop in moderation..."</p>

    <p>"I know." Wang Muyu said.</p>

    <p>"No. I don't think you know anything about it..." Zhuo Yi supported his head: "Actually, from the perspective of our human genetic inheritance, my master Wang Ling. is not your father."</p>

    <p>"I know." Hearing this, Wang Muyu nodded and said again.</p>

    <p>After saying this, everyone in the car was shocked.</p>

    <p>"You know you are..." Sun Rong looked horrified.</p>

    <p>"I'm not blindly admitting it. We dragons are all born in eggs. No matter what the genes are, we only recognize the first person we see." Wang Muyu curled his lips and teased: "That Jingze also has a mother. Same as Ling Yue's mother."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As we all know, Ling Yue was a captured space dragon who defected. He was originally under Bai Zhe's command system.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Muyu said.</p>

    <p>Ling Yue and Jingze's mothers are the same. Then the mother of these two people, no, or rather, the parents of these two people, is most likely Bai Zhe... Bai Zhe can be both a father and a mother on his own!</p>

    <p>However, due to the special nature of the Ling Yue Space Dragon, during the battle, Ling Yue's body became a stand-in. The double replaced the main body, so the defection of the black dragon incident occurred. </p>

    <p>"So the first thing you saw was me. If you recognize me, it would be okay. What does it have to do with classmate Wang Ling?" Sun Rong couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>"It's true that the first person I saw after breaking out of the shell was my mother. But when the shell just cracked, I saw that my mother's memory was full of my father's fa..."</p>

    <p>Before Wang Muyu could finish his words, he was grabbed by Sun Rong and stuffed into her stomach.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why Sun Rong covered his mouth. What he said was obviously the truth.</p>

    <p>But it was visible to the naked eye that his mother's temperature was rising rapidly and her face was very red.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi chuckled. Then he looked at Wang Muyu, with some helplessness on his face: "That is to say, according to the rules of your dragon clan, no matter who laid the egg, the first thing you see is your parents? Little Muyu. Don't you think this model is a bit too hasty..."</p>

    <p>"No way." Wang Muyu smiled and threw himself into Wang Ling's arms: "My dad is very powerful. How can I be careless?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>However, Wang Muyu is not a person who does not consider other people's feelings at all.</p>

    <p>Because of cultural differences, he felt that if he tried hard, it might be counterproductive. Therefore, he had already done some ideological work for himself before coming here to meet Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I know Mom and Dad are giving me a headache. But don't worry, Mom and Dad. I won't cause any trouble to you."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu looked at Wang Ling and said: "From now on, I will call you daddy and mommy only when we are alone."</p>

    <p>"What about normal?"</p>

    <p>"Just call you brother or sister." Wang Muyu laughed.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling and Sun Rong felt a little relieved.</p>

    <p>But this time. Wang Ling also discovered a problem.</p>

    <p>His problem has been solved...</p>

    <p>The real trouble may turn out to be for Father Wang.</p>

    <p>If this little guy calls him brother...</p>

    <p>Then Father Wang may really not be able to explain clearly to Mother Wang...</p>

    <p>Don't say kneeling on the washboard then.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang might ask him directly to borrow Heavenly Dao durian...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in another van, Jiang Yingying was rescued and successfully met with Martial Saint Jiang under the arrangement of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was sent early in the morning to wait in the van. He knew that the person who rescued Jiang Yingying this time was Sun Rong. With Sun Rong here, Jiang Yingying must be unscathed.</p>

    <p>The purpose of his trip was not actually to treat Jiang Yingying's injuries. It was to provide cover for Sun Rong. By the way, it could also make Martial Saint Jiang feel at ease.</p>

    <p>After a symbolic check on the injury, Immortal Toya bowed to Martial Saint Jiang: "Don't worry, Martial Saint. I have checked Miss Yingying. She has not suffered any injuries. And... she is very healthy."</p>

    <p>It can be seen that the old Martial Saint breathed a long sigh of relief. He looked at Jiang Yingying with a firm look in his eyes: "Don't worry. Yingying, grandpa will definitely fight to the death with these unlucky tengu. Sooner or later, he will catch them all!"</p>

    <p>"Of course! Grandpa will definitely do it! But this time I was able to escape unharmed. I really have to thank the pretty sister." Jiang Yingying said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Pretty sister? Is that the young woman from the Office of Strategic Deception who helped rescue you?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know if she's young or not. But the beautiful lady is really powerful! One against a hundred! She has superb swordsmanship! But she wears a nine-tailed fox mask. I didn't see her face clearly. She must be a very beautiful person. Right?" Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>"I dare to ask Immortal. Where can I find her?" Martial Saint Jiang asked as he looked at Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"I have to verify this matter." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"There's no need to check. Grandpa."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying shook her head and said: "The beautiful lady left me her contact information. I will contact her later. She said she would be nervous when she sees you. So if you want to thank her, I can bring the gift over!"</p>

    <p>"Hey, I wanted to express my gratitude in person." Hearing this, Martial Saint Jiang nodded with some regret and said, "But in this case, it's okay. Girls are more shy. If I went there in person, I might put more pressure on her. Yingying, you must always remember that this beautiful lady is your benefactor. Do you know?"</p>

    <p>"I know it, grandpa!" Jiang Yingying replied confidently.</p>

    <p>"Also grandpa, it's about the matter about Yin Hu this time. I heard Yin Hu himself confess that there are Tengu people all over the world. Even if he is put in prison, it may not be safe. He said it before when he was subdued by the beautiful sister. The people on the Tengu side will definitely kill him."</p>

    <p>"Well. This information is very useful. We will be more careful here later."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Martial Saint Jiang nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, Huaxiu Alliance and the Office of Strategic Deception have already found out that there is actually a group of people among the Tengu who are not responsible for information transmission and sharing.</p>

    <p>They are named "Tengu Scavengers." Among the many Tengu, they are the ones who specialize in cleaning up traces and cleaning up doors.</p>

    <p>And next, Yin Hu will most likely be targeted by this group of people...</p>
