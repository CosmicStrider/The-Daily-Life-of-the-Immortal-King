  <h1>Chapter 1266 Heavenly Dao Lower Realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao never thought that the situation would turn out like this... He has been in charge of Death Heavenly Dao for so long. People like him can come in and out of the chat group of the dead at will. There is no one else except Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>After Dao Ancestor Wang created them, in order to make his cultivation life more colorful, he often used the pseudonym of a man named "Agui" to sneak into the chat groups of the dead, disguise himself as the dead and talk to the dead.</p>

    <p>Experience for yourself the lives of these deceased people. Elevate your understanding of "Dao."</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it means taking materials.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. This matter is so strange. Even I am a little confused."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao wiped his sweat and lowered his head and said. He did not dare to look directly into the eyes of Wang Ling: "It stands to reason that after the death of a cultivator in the lower realm, after the death of the Heavenly Dao death system, Heavenly Dao will send a special person in charge. The charming little Golden Men collected the souls of the deceased into the Heavenly Dao soul library. They were eventually distributed according to the system. The souls of the deceased were pulled into the chat group of the deceased..."</p>

    <p>"Did those seductive Golden Men make a mistake in their work? Go check it out quickly! You are so careless. Are you still qualified to be the leader of Heavenly Dao?" Survival Heavenly Dao scolded at the side.</p>

    <p>On the surface, he was scolding him, but in his heart, Heavenly Dao was extremely panicked.</p>

    <p>If the two brothers don't handle this matter well, I'm afraid their position as the main messenger of Heavenly Dao will come to an end... I'm afraid they will be replaced by the recently promoted snack Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>At this time, Heavenly Dao, the leader of the other positions, remained silent.</p>

    <p>At this time, they didn't dare to interfere in the matter at all. Every injustice has its own owner, and its debtor has its owner. The best choice is to silently eat the melon.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao was sweating nervously. He turned the golden ball in his hand. Investigate the seduction record of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The result was once again beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p>"How is this possible!"</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao screamed as if he had seen something horrific. His legs suddenly became weak.</p>

    <p>"What exactly is going on?" Heavenly Dao saw this and quickly put his hand on the magic ball.</p>

    <p>When the seduction record appeared in his mind, Heavenly Dao was also shocked: "This... there is no record?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the other Heavenly Dao finally couldn't sit still.</p>

    <p>This matter is extremely weird!</p>

    <p>"There is no record? How is this possible?" Time Heavenly Dao spoke first.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that the little Golden Men responsible for seducing people cannot make such a low-level mistake.</p>

    <p>So. In the absence of the little Golden Men seducing the soul of Sun Rong from the lower realm.</p>

    <p>A surprising question arises...</p>

    <p>Who seduced Sun Rong's soul?</p>

    <p>Suppose he was seduced by an outsider. Then why could this seducer bring Sun Rong's soul to the Heavenly Dao soul vault...</p>

    <p>These questions entangled other Heavenly Dao, making the surrounding atmosphere tense instantly.</p>

    <p>Now they thought of a very terrifying thing.</p>

    <p>That is the heaven where Heavenly Dao is located. It may be being invaded by foreign objects!</p>

    <p>At this time, the other envoys from Heavenly Dao finally realized the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>"Investigate! This matter must be investigated to the end!" Power Heavenly Dao spoke first: "If Heaven is being invaded, we can't deny it! Space. Don't you have anything to say? You have surveillance on all spaces in Heaven."</p>

    <p>"Invasion..."</p>

    <p>Space Heavenly Dao frowned: "But I didn't feel anything strange. All Heavenly Dao Golden Men in space are operating in an orderly manner."</p>

    <p>"Then what's going on? Is there a traitor among us?"</p>

    <p>Power Space held the table with both hands. Then he turned his gaze to Soul Heavenly Dao: "Soul. You don't feel anything unusual either?"</p>

    <p>The soul Heavenly Dao sighed slightly: "Although I am the soul Heavenly Dao, I am not responsible for the things that enchant the souls. I only conduct the final judgment and appeal work on the souls of those who have committed evil deeds. The rest. I Don't care at all."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also knows about this matter.</p>

    <p>The meaning of the soul Heavenly Dao's existence is more like an arbiter. And the ability is "torture from the soul."</p>

    <p>If those who have made mistakes can withstand the torture of their souls, it proves that they have repented from the bottom of their hearts.</p>

    <p>It shows that these people have not lost their conscience and still have the opportunity to start a new life.</p>

    <p>And for these people, even if they have made mistakes, the soul Heavenly Dao will make the final decision. They will be given a lighter sentence based on the results of the soul torture.</p>

    <p>As for those who did not survive the soul torture phase, most were sent to the animal realm...</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. You have also seen it. This matter is very strange... In heaven, we must thoroughly investigate this matter. We will definitely find out who is repeatedly seducing Miss Sun's soul." Heavenly Dao said to Wang Ling Zuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling waited for about ten seconds. After the six major leaders of the Heavenly Dao Committee, Heavenly Dao, discussed together.</p>

    <p>Represented by the death Heavenly Dao. Finally, Wang Ling was given a preliminary plan: "Ling Zhenren. Let's do this... I will go down to the world in person. Hibernate next to Miss Sun Rong. If the person coming is Heavenly The seductive little Golden Men in Dao. With my authority, I can definitely stop them easily."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao kept wiping his sweat: "Ling Zhenren, don't worry. I am fully responsible for this matter. I believe it will be resolved soon... As for the death talisman. My brother survives in the lower realm of Heavenly Dao. Help Ling Zhenren draw it. My brother Although his cultivation level is far inferior to that of Ling Zhenren. But if his survival seal is added to the death talisman, the effect of this death talisman can barely reach the length of Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>The Great Seal of Survival?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. He knew the origin of this seal.</p>

    <p>The six main themes of Heavenly Dao all have exclusive magic weapons specially created by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>These Heavenly Dao magic weapons are even higher than the opposite level magic weapons. Their power is astonishing.</p>

    <p>"Then. Do as you say."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a while and finally agreed to the plan proposed by the Heavenly Dao Committee.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he really felt that the whole thing was weird.</p>

    <p>This Heavenly Dao is the seductive messenger sent by the little Golden Men.</p>

    <p>Without any record of seducing souls, it can easily sequester the soul of Sun Rong into the Heavenly Dao soul vault.</p>

    <p>As for this matter, not one of the six leaders of the Heavenly Dao Committee, Heavenly Dao, was aware of it.</p>

    <p>Yin and Yang Death Tribulation...</p>

    <p>What the hell is this?</p>

    <p>"Zhenren. We two brothers are ready."</p>

    <p>At this time, the two twin brothers, Life and Death Heavenly Dao, said in unison.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his gaze away and found that the two of them had already put on human skin coats.</p>

    <p>This is Heavenly Dao's special disguise when in the nether world.</p>

    <p>Their essence is still little Golden Men.</p>

    <p>And this human skin coat can completely cover up their Heavenly Dao aura.</p>

    <p>This human leather coat was also the masterpiece of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>The uncanny craftsmanship is truly amazing.</p>

    <p>At this time, the two brothers Heavenly Dao, life and death, stood in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Their human appearance is very young. They are tall and handsome, with bright eyes and fair skin. The two brothers are wearing denim overalls. They look like young people.</p>

    <p>The way to distinguish them is the golden word Heavenly Dao between their eyebrows.</p>

    <p>One life, one death.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao text between the eyebrows cannot be seen by any outsider except Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, Survival Heavenly Dao clasped his fists and said respectfully to Wang Ling: "Ling Zhenren. We can go down to the lower realm at any time. However, my two brothers currently have no status in the lower realm. This requires Ling Zhenren's help. Help."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>This is not the first time he has helped someone get their ID card.</p>

    <p>Just leave everything to Zhuo Yi.</p>
