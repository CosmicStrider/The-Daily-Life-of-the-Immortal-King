  <h1>Chapter 1281 The wonderful adventure of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Following the instructions of Sun Rong. Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao began to organize the {Great Sacrifice Technique}.</p>

    <p>This spell was previously cast by Wang Ling specifically for Taoist Guang.</p>

    <p>At that time, Lord Diulei used this technique to burn many things into it.</p>

    <p>But now, Daoist Guang is still addicted to being a network anchor in his own independent soul space and cannot extricate himself. (For a review of the past, please see Chapter 411: Eat more chicken. You can do it too)</p>

    <p>On the physical side of the hospital. Death Heavenly Dao called out a few more Heavenly Dao little Golden Men to take care of the lower world.</p>

    <p>He and Zhuo Yi acted together. They went to the luxurious villa where the girl lived.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi drove to the door. He saw several maids sorting the gifts piled on the ground at the door.</p>

    <p>These gifts are beautifully packaged. There are hundreds of them, stacked high like a hill.</p>

    <p>"Hello." Zhuo Yi held up the Golden Lotus and took the initiative to ask about the situation.</p>

    <p>The head maid put her broom aside and tried to keep a smile: "Well, the lady is in the hospital now. She is still being treated. Thank you for taking the time to send condolences. Just put the things on the ground. We appreciate your kindness. I will convey this to you...We are currently not accepting outsiders."</p>

    <p>Obviously, the head maid was quite helpless about the situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>In the past two days, they have received no less than a hundred pieces of condolence gifts, large and small. Everyone who came asked twice. After confirming the situation, they put down the gifts and left.</p>

    <p>The head maid has said this rhetoric hundreds of times in the past two days. She can almost recite it backwards.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed inwardly at the professionalism of the head maid.</p>

    <p>No matter how busy and tiring you are at work, you will never write your emotions directly on your expression when facing outsiders.</p>

    <p>"This is Aunt Qiu. She is the head maid who has always taken good care of me!" At this time, the girl in Buddha's Golden Lotus said.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao has established an independent spiritual chat channel. Everything spoken by Sun Rong can be transmitted to the ears of Zhuo Yi and death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu has always been a maid who puts the overall situation first. She is honest and kind-hearted, and treats others warmly and politely.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong is hiding in the Golden Lotus and watching all this.</p>

    <p>The performance of the head maid did not disappoint her.</p>

    <p>"Are you Aunt Qiu?" Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Aunt Qiu was stunned. Not many people knew her name, unless they were members of the family.</p>

    <p>But she looked at Zhuo Yi very strangely. She didn't look like someone from the family. However, this face became more and more familiar to Aunt Qiu: "I remembered. You are the one on TV... Carry it on your hairy legs!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "???"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "It seems that the first time Aunt Qiu met Senior Zhuo was at the spirit sword exchange meeting reported by the local station... and she seems to only remember this incident."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi feels very wronged.</p>

    <p>He obviously took the blame for so many earth-shattering things.</p>

    <p>In the end, only people remembered the embarrassment he made on the day of the Spirit Sword Exchange Meeting...</p>

    <p>"Hello Aunt Qiu...my name is Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! I remembered it!" Aunt Qiu showed a bright smile: "You are Miss Sun Rong's senior, right? When I heard Miss Sun Rong talk about things in school, she talked the second most. It's you. Where's the one with the most?"</p>

    <p>"A classmate named Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..." You are indeed a master!</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu: "I wonder what Mr. Zhuo is here for this time?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. We were entrusted by Mr. Boss Sun. We are here to bring some of Miss Sun Rong's clothes and some daily necessities."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi followed the instructions of Sun Rong. After speaking, he also showed his work ID: "The Mr. Wang next to me is a staff member traveling with me."</p>

    <p>"Oh. So that's it."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu nodded: "Just follow me. I will lead you to Miss Sun's room."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the old aunt told the maids at the door: "You guys, please gather up the condolences at the door and send them to the warehouse. I'll come over later to take stock."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>The maids responded one after another.</p>

    <p>Then he lowered his head and started busy with the work at hand as instructed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When passing the huge garden fountain in the atrium, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but ask: "Who are the people who come to deliver gifts at the door? Are you familiar with Sun Rong's school girl?"</p>

    <p>"Not familiar."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu shook her head: "Some are partners around our group. Others are here to inquire about information."</p>

    <p>"Prying for information?"</p>

    <p>"Miss is seriously ill. It will definitely have an impact on the stock. These capitalists want to explore the truth."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu frowned and said: "We are one of the largest pill-making companies in the world. We have developed countless life-saving pills. If we can't even save the life of our young master, the impact will be absolutely huge... Of course, the master himself is very good. Miss Pai Xi. He doesn't care about the stock issue. But he can't help others caring."</p>

    <p>"What about these gifts?"</p>

    <p>"Put it in the warehouse first. Then return it all when you have the opportunity." Aunt Qiu said.</p>

    <p>She led Zhuo Yi forward.</p>

    <p>The Sun family villa is surprisingly large. Zhuo Yi felt like I had been walking for several minutes. I had just reached the door.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the splendid main hall, Aunt Qiu took out the remote control and began to operate the lifting platform embedded in the center.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"Teleportation circle. It can save some distance." Aunt Qiu said.</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>This is the world of rich people after all. He doesn't understand...</p>

    <p>I actually need to set up teleportation at home.</p>

    <p>Only later did Zhuo Yi find out that such teleportation circles were spread throughout every corner of the Sun family villa.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it makes it easier for people to move around. On the other hand, it can also effectively prevent some visitors from visiting the villa randomly and seeing things they shouldn't see.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's room is on the south side of the villa. There is also a very grand living room in the middle. The teleportation array is not directly accessible. It requires a second teleportation.</p>

    <p>And when Zhuo Yi and several people were teleported to the living room. Zhuo Yi heard the noise in the living room.</p>

    <p>"You are not allowed to enter the hospital. You people who are usually so close to Sun Rong's sister don't know the news? Why do I not believe it so much?" A young man with a tall nose sat on the sofa in the living room with his legs crossed. superior.</p>

    <p>In front of him stood a row of six maids in total.</p>

    <p>The young man's attitude was arrogant. His whole body exuded the air of a playboy.</p>

    <p>The clothes he wears are quite human-like. However, Zhuo Yi sees too many people. You can tell what kind of person he is from his conversation.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi didn't mind his own business.</p>

    <p>The person who can still enter this living room at this juncture probably has something to do with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It must be someone within the family.</p>

    <p>Seeing the maids lowering their heads and refusing to speak, the young man pretended to be heartbroken.</p>

    <p>"I know. Aunt Qiu told you not to leak any information. It's very difficult for you. But you also need to know. I am Sun Rong's sister's cousin! This relationship is thicker than water. I want to know something about my sister. Current situation. Any questions?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the young man snapped his fingers. A bodyguard in black put the huge black suitcase on the coffee table: "I'm Fan Xing. I'm not a stingy person. I answered the question today. The money in the box is just Take it as a bonus. Take it as you like! But if you refuse to say it, you will be responsible for the consequences!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo, Mr. Wang. I'm sorry for making you laugh. The younger members of this family are ignorant. They are just troublesome."</p>

    <p>In front of the living room door. Aunt Qiu turned around and apologized to Zhuo Yi and others.</p>

    <p>If an outsider comes to cause trouble, it will be easier for her to handle it. She can just take action.</p>

    <p>It just so happens that Fan Xing is from within the family.</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu still treated me politely.</p>

    <p>In order to find out information about Sun Rong, Fan Xing has been staying here for two whole days.</p>

    <p>Now that she heard Fan Xing threatening her maids with her own ears, Aunt Qiu finally couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>However, she still maintained a very professional smile. She walked forward with a kind face and said: "Master Fan, I remember I made it very clear. The lady is in the hospital. She is safe and sound. Master Fan has nothing to worry about."</p>

    <p>"Really?"</p>

    <p>Fan Xing smiled: "But how did I hear that she is dying?"</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu was already taking a deep breath: "Master Fan, please. Don't listen to unconfirmed news."</p>

    <p>"What a pity."</p>

    <p>Fan Xing shrugged: "Sun Rong Before I got sick, my sister had a lifelong relationship with me. Now she falls ill. If she doesn't wake up, who can I talk to to reason? You can give up if you want me to. Please Boss Sun, please come out and talk about compensating me. I am a boy who is easily hurt both mentally and physically."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu suppressed her anger: "Master Fan...ruined the reputation of the young lady. What good will it do to you?"</p>

    <p>Fan Xing haha: "Aunt Qiu, do you think you know Sun Rong sister very well? I have a lot of exclusive news about Sun Rong sister here."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Buddha's Golden Lotus, when the girl saw the person coming, she also had one head and four heads.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I knew he would come to cause trouble..."</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space. She communicates with Zhuo Yi, Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Sun Rong Don't you like this person?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "He was once one of my suitors..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked: "Isn't this your cousin!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held his forehead with a headache: "He said that he had undergone blood transfusion all over his body. His whole body is full of high-quality genes. There is no orthopedic component at all..."</p>

    <p>"What a disgusting person!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi secretly sneered. Immediately he asked Death Heavenly Dao: "Senior, can you look at this person's lifespan?"</p>

    <p>"He will be sent to the hospital soon." At this time, Heavenly Dao stared at the young man on the sofa.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing didn't know why, but suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do, senior?" Zhuo Yi asked in the mental space.</p>

    <p>"Have you seen the movie?"</p>

    <p>"What movie?"</p>

    <p>"{Death is coming}"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao snorted.</p>
