  <h1>Chapter 1719 Meet the Grand Master!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a dragon-born chaos weapon with a sequence level of three. It is called "Immortal Diamond." It is made from the dragon skeleton corresponding to the dragon power he possesses. It can be used in front of this little girl. The power of the fist was difficult to withstand. The gap was opened directly.</p>

    <p>Something is wrong...</p>

    <p>Jingze was very decisive. He quickly retreated. The golden lightning dragonborn behind him opened up. As it opened, countless thunderbolts fell nearby. He tried to quickly distance himself from Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Nuan's movements were faster than he imagined. As he retreated, he saw the shadows on the ground suddenly erupt. They turned into flexible tentacles that followed at an extremely fast speed.</p>

    <p>What ability is this?</p>

    <p>He was shocked in his heart. Jingze didn't expect that the flash he created when he opened his Thunder Dragonborn would actually help Wang Nuan. The little girl used her Shadow ability to quickly track him down. But what she captured was his shadow.</p>

    <p>An instinctive sense of danger immediately surged into his heart. Especially the moment his shadow was captured by Wang Nuan, Jingze guessed it. Then he felt that his vision went dark and he was taken into a different world.</p>

    <p>This is the supreme world unique to Wang Nuan. It is also the supreme world exclusive to Shadow. All the scenes inside are the same as those on the earth. But all the creatures are a black shadow!</p>

    <p>The world of shadows?</p>

    <p>Jingze was shocked. At the same time, the people who were captured in this world were also Yan? behind him. At this moment, Yan? also had her mouth wide open. She looked at the scene in front of her in disbelief. She was so scared that she dropped the ice cream ball.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that a baby girl who was barely a month old could be so tyrannical.</p>

    <p>"Is this girl a master of the Dao?" Jingze's heart trembled. He felt that the situation in front of him suddenly reversed.</p>

    <p>Having the ability to have a great path is not a terrible thing. It is not unusual for a person to have multiple great paths. But if it is the master of the great path who created this path... then you have to weigh it carefully.</p>

    <p>"Yan?. We have to leave..."</p>

    <p>After a brief thought, Jingze made a decision.</p>

    <p>He acted very calmly. He did not hesitate to fight Wang Nuan. As the first dragonborn created, Jingze knew very well how heavy the lifeline of the dragon clan was on his shoulders.</p>

    <p>If he had a head-on fight with Wang Nuan here, it was unknown who would win and who would lose. But he felt that it would most likely be a lose-lose situation for both sides.</p>

    <p>Now is the critical moment for the Dragon Clan's recovery. He calmly believes that there is no need to fight head-on.</p>

    <p>Although running away is a shame for the Dragonborn, if you don't endure the humiliation now, you may never have another chance in the future.</p>

    <p>"But..." Regarding Jingze's decision, Yan? muttered. She actually didn't want to run away. She also wanted to fight the baby girl in front of her.</p>

    <p>"No but. I hate it. This is the work order from Shangfeng." Jingze responded.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to run away, but he didn't want to admit that he was a coward, so he found this excuse.</p>

    <p>Among the tasks originally assigned to them by Baobai, Wang Nuan was the most special being.</p>

    <p>If something goes wrong, you can choose to evacuate.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Nuan's exclusive supreme world. If others were trapped here, there would be no possibility of escape. But they are dragonborn... use the power of the dragon to forcefully open a gap. It can still be done.</p>

    <p>"Hey!"</p>

    <p>Just about to start, Wang Nuan over there moved faster than them. The little girl rode 096 and used it as a means of transportation. It was obviously just a baby's body, but its maneuverability was amazing.</p>

    <p>He and Yan had not yet made any move. In the blink of an eye, Wang Nuan's figure had appeared behind him. The fleshy little fist was hitting his spine.</p>

    <p>Jingze's color changed instantly. He could see that this was no ordinary blow. At the same time as the punch was delivered, there was the sound of landslides and tsunamis. The entire shadow world was trembling with a supreme sound of the Dao, mixed with the terrifying sound of the Dao. The power of the Lord!</p>

    <p>Before the small fist came, Jingze had already developed a life-threatening pressure. The overwhelming wind of the fist slapped his back, shaking his dragonborn like an umbrella tumbling in the wind. The entire keel could not stop. It fell in the direction of the fist wind. It couldn't even fly!</p>

    <p>This baby is so terrifying! She's only less than a month old. She's actually so strong...</p>

    <p>Just talk about combat power.</p>

    <p>This girl is much stronger than the monks I have seen before.</p>

    <p>And he seriously doubted that the Buddha named Wang mentioned by the monk was most likely related to the little girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>Why do such outrageous characters appear on earth? Where do they come from?</p>

    <p>Jingze was puzzled. The couple in the villa were obviously just ordinary people. How could they give birth to such a powerful earthly cultivator?</p>

    <p>Could it be...</p>

    <p>Is it related to the legendary mysterious object?</p>

    <p>His mind was filled with endless reveries, and many possible guesses suddenly came to mind. Although he was scared, Jingze had to think about it, because considering the subsequent development of the Dragon Clan, if they wanted to regain the Dragon Clan, maybe this girl in front of him and that one The Buddha named Wang may become their biggest obstacle.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>This punch was like an autumn wind blowing away fallen leaves. It hit his spine firmly. Jingze spit out a large mouthful of blood. However, he did not suffer any serious injuries.</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, the black umbrella behind him blocked another blow for him. At the same time, the moment the punch came closer, Yan? spat out lava and instantly built a powerful lava barrier.</p>

    <p>Just at the moment of completion, Wang Nuan's punch came almost at the same time, directly piercing the barrier and hitting Jingze.</p>

    <p>Although he was still beaten until he vomited blood, at least it still played some protective role.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the barrier of Black Umbrella and Yan?, Jingze suspected that his spine had been broken...</p>

    <p>"Yan?. Let's go!"</p>

    <p>He shouted loudly, and once again moved away from Wang Nuan. At the same time, he held up the black umbrella behind his back. A chaotic vortex was generated from under his feet.</p>

    <p>The God-Eating Umbrella opened a very small opening in this supreme world.</p>

    <p>Only the size of a mouse hole.</p>

    <p>But Jingze still got in disgustedly without hesitation.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Nuan did not pursue again.</p>

    <p>This was the first time she fought against someone with dragon power. She thought she would be a good combat training target. However, Wang Nuan also felt from the previous fight that the power of the two was not fully activated.</p>

    <p>So she didn't pursue them. Instead, she planned to give the two of them another chance to grow. It would be a pity if they just played with each other until they died.</p>

    <p>After driving away the two dragonborns, Wang Nuan left her supreme world.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she also released Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi and Jiugong Liangzi who were protected in his supreme world.</p>

    <p>Among all the people, only Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi and Jiugong Liangzi are special cases. They were personally arranged by Wang Ling to be protected by Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that I am worried that these two dragonborns will cause trouble for them. It is Zhuo Yi's privilege as a disciple.</p>

    <p>As for Zhou Ziyi and Jiugong Liangzi, they are jointly protected because they are inseparable from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After all, the Dragonborn's combat prowess is amazing.</p>

    <p>No one can handle it except Wang Ling and Wang Nuan's level of combat power.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Master!"</p>

    <p>After being released, Zhuo Yi quickly bowed to Wang Nuan and thanked her. At the same time, he also winked at Jiugong Liangzi and Zhou Ziyi who were stunned and had not fully recovered.</p>

    <p>"Many... thank you Nuan Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>The two bowed. At the same time, their minds went blank. They had been hiding in Ah Nuan girl's body and watching the scene of Ah Nuan girl's blaster dragonborn. They were shocked and speechless.</p>

    <p>"You are usually very clever. Why didn't you react now?" Listening to Zhou Ziyi and Jiugong Liangzi calling Wang Nuan Nuan Zhenren together. Zhuo Yi smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Jiugong Liangzi is now his girlfriend. It is natural that they should be protected together.</p>

    <p>But why is Zhou Ziyi protected?</p>

    <p>This is actually not difficult to analyze.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought that Wang Ling had already admitted that Zhou Ziyi was his disciple in disguise!</p>

    <p>"Why don't you pay your respects to Grand Master Auntie soon!"</p>

    <p>He stared at Zhou Ziyi who was stunned. He looked at Wang Nuan and smiled.</p>

    <p>Starting from this day.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi. He is also one of his own.</p>
