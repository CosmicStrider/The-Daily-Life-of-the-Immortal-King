  <h1>Chapter 1660 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As a brain wave control user, Wang Ming naturally knows the dangers of connecting two brain waves in series.</p>

    <p>He hypnotized himself into "Jia Bugui." It is easy to completely pretend to be Jia Bugui. But if you get too deep into the drama, you may not be able to get out in the end.</p>

    <p>However, this brain wave is only a small segment that Wang Ming has differentiated. Even if something unexpected happens, at most, this small segment of brain wave will be assimilated and will not have any impact on the body of the outside world.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes, he opened his eyes with a flushed face. Jia Bugui's body was obviously hot due to the operation of brain waves. Steam even came out of the top of his head.</p>

    <p>"For now, it's successful." Wang Ming nodded and said, "I have homogenized his brainwave band. You can access it at any time and become him. And you will not be discovered by the will guards. In action, I have used myself Suggestion implantation of brain waves. Just through specific gestures or sounds, you can control Boss Jia's body to act."</p>

    <p>"In other words, it's not fully connected yet, right?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right. A complete access to the brainwaves. Twist the two brainwaves into a rope. It seems to me this is a last resort. Because once it's in. I'll be Jabu. It's hard to say if I'll be able to get out. It's hard to say." Wang Ming replied.</p>

    <p>Currently, he is still semi-connected.</p>

    <p>Because of the brain waves, he became "Jia Bugui." This was probably an unexpected thing for Master Wu Xin and his apprentices.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ming also knows how important the role he plays is.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he must use his identity to make every next move well.</p>

    <p>If you make the slightest mistake, everyone here is at risk of being exposed.</p>

    <p>And the plan that Lord Diulei painstakingly entrusted to Senior Xiang Yi to lay out here for many years will completely turn into a bubble.</p>

    <p>The people sitting here are not stupid. Of course, they can imagine everything Wang Ming can think of and all the concerns in his heart.</p>

    <p>Just like Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>They have to wait until they use Jia Bugui's identity to trick Master Wu Xin and his disciple Nawei into the trap they set through the "Guard of Will." This is the last step.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qin Zhong stared at Wang Ming's "Jia Bugui" face. After looking at it for a long time, he suddenly thought of something and asked, "Speaking of which, there should be more than just our group who have sneaked into this world." Well, I met Brother Zhuo and classmate Ziyi. Then I met you."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei "I saw the text message sent by Miss Rong and Miss Liangzi. At that time, Brother Gou and I happened to be investigating the robbery of Shou Chong. Unexpectedly, we tracked it to the edge of the Virtual Realm."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked when he heard this, "It was Master's Wife who sent you the message. No wonder Liangzi came with me. It seems that when I sent the message to Master's Wife, she was probably nearby."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was ashamed, "So they came here after seeing your text message, Brother Zhuo? By the way, they called Senior Jin Deng?"</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid that's right."</p>

    <p>"Then how do you know about this Virtual Realm."</p>

    <p>"Of course they are seniors Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. They should be the first group of people to visit this Virtual Realm."</p>

    <p>Everyone heard this and fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>The real purpose behind this series of matryoshka behavior is actually to change the map and hold the Office of Strategic Deception team building activity.</p>

    <p>"Are these two seniors strong?" At this time, Qin Zhong asked again.</p>

    <p>It's not just him. Even Xiang Yi has a confused look on his face.</p>

    <p>After all, they were the only outsiders in this Office of Strategic Deception team-building activity.</p>

    <p>"These two are eternal masters," Er Ha said with a head of green hair and a face full of shame.</p>

    <p>So, after the current analysis, everyone in the tavern suddenly discovered an extremely difficult problem.</p>

    <p>The first group to come in were Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>The second group is Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi, Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>The third group is Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi, Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>The current fourth group, Lord Diulei, Er Ha, Xiang Yi and Wang Ming, has merged with the second group to form one group.</p>

    <p>The current strategy of their group is to use the Will Guard to deceive Master Wu Xin into tricking out a few more things.</p>

    <p>But now the actions don't match.</p>

    <p>It is very likely that a very unfortunate situation will arise, that is, the other two groups of people, without knowing their plan at all, will rush over and take out the entire will guard.</p>

    <p>Obviously, everyone had thought about this matter. They couldn't help but feel a little worried for a while.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we need to enter the core area as soon as possible to make peace with them." Lord Diulei smiled bitterly. To tell the truth, it was also his fault that this Virtual Realm trip turned into such a situation.</p>

    <p>I originally wanted to hide my secret and investigate secretly, but I didn't expect that everyone else also noticed this place.</p>

    <p>"But to enter the core area openly, you need to prepare a pass. The market price of the pass is now 20 million gold gear coins plus the 60 million silver gear coins earned by the Qin Zhong brothers. I'm afraid it's not enough for us. "Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"It's easy. If you count my money, it's no problem to buy a few." At this time, Xiang Yi stood up.</p>

    <p>After all, he was entrusted to be stationed in this world as the director of the waste recycling station very early. He still accumulated some money.</p>

    <p>"How much can you buy"</p>

    <p>"Based on my family property, I can probably buy three tickets with my meager savings," Xiang Yi said after calculation.</p>

    <p>"Three 60 million gold gear coins" He and everyone were stunned. They all looked at him with admiration.</p>

    <p>Is it so profitable to do waste recycling now?</p>

    <p>"It's just a trivial means." Xiang Yi said with a modest smile.</p>

    <p>However, even so, there are seven people in their group. Except for Wang Ming, who has the identity of Jia Bugui, there are still three people who do not meet the conditions for entering the core area.</p>

    <p>"If it's 3, it might be feasible." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ming means"</p>

    <p>"In the core. It's not like there aren't any shabby people. But the shabby ones. Most of them are slaves, servants and the like, bought by the rich and powerful from the slums outside."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "Let's do it this way. Let's continue with the current grouping. Let Brother Xiang Yi give the three passes he bought to Brother Zhuo Yi's group. I'll have Zenjun, Xiang Yi and Er Ha follow me into the city.</p>

    <p>"Of course no problem."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said, "Where will we meet after entering the city?"</p>

    <p>"In the core area, Jia Bugui has an astrology club. Just gather there." At this time, Wang Ming said.</p>
