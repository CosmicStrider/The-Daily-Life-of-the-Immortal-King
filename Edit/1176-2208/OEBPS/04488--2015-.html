  <h1>Chapter 2015 Bright Moon Night. Run!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dark clouds mixed with chaotic energy shrouded the entire sky of Songhai City, accompanied by earth-shattering thunderstorms.</p>

    <p>The weather forecast said that today was originally a clear and good day. But now the situation has changed, causing all the few high-level people in Songhai City to open their eyes and look at the sky.</p>

    <p>They know. I'm afraid someone is about to break through.</p>

    <p>However, they didn't know that the changes in the heaven and earth were not just a simple Tribulation Transcendence. It was the terrifying pressure brought by one person day and night.</p>

    <p>It is now afternoon. The dark clouds above the Office of Strategic Deception sky are the darkest. The entire sky seems to be covered by an invisible hand. No light can penetrate.</p>

    <p>All the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception noticed something strange, but they could not move. They were enduring this sudden and inexplicable pressure drop in their respective training halls.</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception peaks, major scientific cultivation training halls, as well as the True Venerated Immortal Hall. The protective barrier was activated almost at the same time.</p>

    <p>This is the intelligent defense mechanism being turned on. This made many Office of Strategic Deception disciples immediately realize that this abnormal movement of heaven and earth was by no means some Tribulation Transcendence of an expert. It was indeed a sign of invasion by a foreign enemy!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the Office of Strategic Deception has a complete defense deployment. This protective barrier was jointly laid by Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Monk Jin Deng. It can defend against external enemies in a short period of time. There is no problem at all.</p>

    <p>The Mountain of Retrospect. Deep in the Black Forest.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling continues to reproduce the previous last-ditch development method. By shooting the True Immortal-level strange spiritual beasts deep in the black forest, Sun Rong can develop rapidly.</p>

    <p>On the way to the depths of the black forest, Wang Ling killed several more human-faced thunder dragons. The golden light surrounding the girl became even more intense.</p>

    <p>As long as you successfully finish off the True Immortal-level giant in front of you, it will only take a moment to form the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>This kind of training speed is not unreasonable. After all, Wang Ling calculated the time when he and Sun Rong entered the black forest. The total time was less than 3 hours.</p>

    <p>It takes 3 hours to break through the bottleneck directly from the peak of the late Foundation Building stage to the early stage of the Golden Core. The speed of training on a rocket is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Judging from the speed of time outside on the mountain of retrospect, only 30 seconds have passed in the outside world.</p>

    <p>He is about to break through. As the main trainee of this practice, Sun Rong is naturally very aware of the changes in his body.</p>

    <p>She focused her gaze. Even when facing the mountain-like True Immortal beast in front of her, she still maintained extremely high mental willpower.</p>

    <p>"That's it. Here, Sister Rong, just stab it in." Jingke was also secretly assisting Sun Rong, helping Sun Rong find the position where he could easily complete the final touch-up.</p>

    <p>No matter how powerful the True Immortal-level spiritual beast is, it is still dying after being hit by Wang Ling. With its spiritual power unable to function, all its built-in shields are in a broken state.</p>

    <p>No matter how thick the skin is, as long as there is precise guidance, hunting it will not be a problem.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took steps and tried to get closer. At the same time, sweat couldn't stop dripping from her cheeks. She was about to stab her for the last time. However, when she approached the pass, she found that her eyes were in a trance. Accompanied by her vain steps. Then the whole person suddenly fell down.</p>

    <p>"Is it still too much?..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He seemed to have expected this scene early, so he carefully stood behind the girl to protect her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not fall directly to the ground. Instead, at the moment when he was close to the earth, he was lifted up by Wang Ling using the attraction technique. Like a light feather, the whole person was suspended in mid-air.</p>

    <p>"What should I do, Sister Rong? There is only one last step left." Jingke asked.</p>

    <p>We have reached a critical point. It is indeed a pity.</p>

    <p>Moreover, allowing the girl to break through the Golden Core during this practice is also Wang Ling's personal commitment.</p>

    <p>As an honest and reliable young cultivator, fulfilling one's promises is still very important to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he didn't think much about it. He directly used the attraction technique to straighten Sun Rong's body. Then he guided the dagger into the girl's palm. He then held the back of her hand and helped her stab the vital part with the knife!</p>

    <p>It was an action completed in an instant. After confirming that the dagger was inserted, Wang Ling's figure immediately disappeared and retreated a long distance.</p>

    <p>This is to ensure that the vaporized spiritual core of the final blow can be exclusively used by the girl.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Wang Ling felt relieved.</p>

    <p>At the same time, as the golden light burst out of Sun Rong's body, a Golden Core the size of a table tennis ball finally took shape in her body.</p>

    <p>Finally successfully broke through...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the dim black forest changed rapidly. All the strange spiritual beasts disappeared. Because the training mission had been successfully completed, the mountain of retrospection at this moment also automatically adjusted to the relaxation mode due to the intelligent system.</p>

    <p>This black forest is no longer dark. Instead, it is the tall maple trees. Endless fiery red maple leaves are falling from all directions, making this piece of heaven and earth translucent. They do not look so coquettish. On the contrary, there is a kind of beauty that makes people feel at ease...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm. He carefully used the attraction technique to place the girl smoothly on the leaf bed made of countless red maple leaves.</p>

    <p>The sky shrouded in darkness also shone brightly again. Wisps of light passed through the huge maple leaf forest, reflecting the bright red color on the leaves. It also reflected on the face of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>After confirming that the surrounding environment was absolutely safe, Wang Ling sat down next to the girl and enjoyed the moment of comfort.</p>

    <p>He knew that at this time, the outside world's Office of Strategic Deception's defense mechanism had been activated.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye, the prehistoric illusionist who previously thought he had destroyed the legendary killer Dai Tianchun, has entered this mysterious forbidden forest.</p>

    <p>To be honest, people like Mingyue Ye are just clown-like existences in the eyes of Wang Ling. From the beginning, Wang Ling has never taken them seriously.</p>

    <p>He even wanted to use Mingyue Ye's hand to integrate the alien forces that had flowed to the earth, and then catch them all in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>In the end, I didn't expect that this desperate guy could come to the door so quickly, so calmly, and so confidently.</p>

    <p>After feeling the powerful evil aura on Mingyue Ye, Wang Ling lazily opened his eyes and opened an entrance directly in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>Then he stood up and stepped out.</p>

    <p>He was facing the person in front of him, Ming Yueye himself, who was drooling and looking for the strong man.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Ming Yue Ye's face clearly showed great confusion. She never expected that under such terrifying spiritual pressure, someone could actually walk out of the space passage and confront him so calmly.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Mingyue Ye also discovered that at such a close distance, he was completely unable to see through the true face of the person in front of him...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face was an extremely blurry shadow, both in his sight and in his perception.</p>

    <p>It's like being beaten into a mosaic!</p>
