  <h1>Chapter 1340 Miss is in love</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Maybe some secret technique?</p>

    <p>This was Boss Sun's first reaction after seeing the USB flash drive.</p>

    <p>After all, it was a gift from Lord Diulei. The master of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>Not so stingy after all.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan quickly ordered someone to bring a laptop to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, let's take a look. There might be something important inside. Grandpa, please stay away for now."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun smiled. Then he stood up.</p>

    <p>Everyone has their own. This needs to be respected.</p>

    <p>The old man is a sensible man.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he also knows the behavior of the people in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>It's stored in the USB flash drive. It's definitely not a mess.</p>

    <p>As long as he knows this, it is enough.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Grandpa, don't you want to see it?" The girl wanted to share it together.</p>

    <p>"This is something your friend left for you. Grandpa doesn't think it's appropriate." Mr. Boss Sun shook his head: "If you need anything, just press the call button next to the bed. Grandpa will be with you next door."</p>

    <p>He gave up all the work in the group and planned to spend this time with his precious granddaughter.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, grandpa." Sun Rong's eyebrows were curved.</p>

    <p>Then, out of curiosity, he plugged the USB flash drive into his laptop and plugged in the headphones...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first thing she looked at was the USB flash drive sent by Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Inside the USB flash drive is a video material recorded by Lord Diulei himself.</p>

    <p>This is a video recorded by Lord Diulei in his office.</p>

    <p>In the video, Lord Diulei is still wearing a familiar white slim-fitting cassock. His long black hair hangs down naturally. His whole body is straight.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, when you see this video, you may wonder why I, the master of the Office of Strategic Deception, would record such a video for you."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei spoke eloquently: "First of all, what I want to tell you is that you have lost a memory..."</p>

    <p>The entire video is about 15 minutes long.</p>

    <p>After the girl read it carefully, although the memory picture in her mind was not completely restored, she seemed to have a general understanding of the whole incident.</p>

    <p>And in the introduction of Lord Diulei. Sun Rong heard a familiar name... Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Is he so powerful..."</p>

    <p>The expression on the girl's face was completely different from the surprised expression when she first heard it.</p>

    <p>She didn't even expect it.</p>

    <p>All events actually happened because of myself.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling. silently did so many things for her...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei told the whole incident from his own point of view. Naturally, there are some omissions. But the advantage is that it is logically clear and organized.</p>

    <p>The dignified head of the Office of Strategic Deception. There is no need to make up such a story. It was specially given to myself as a gift.</p>

    <p>Of course. If this is just what Lord Diulei said, the girl may still have doubts.</p>

    <p>But now, she has three USB flash drives in her hand.</p>

    <p>The second USB flash drive was sent by the Heavenly Dao who pretended to be disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In the video, Power Heavenly Dao is sitting in front of the table god of the Heavenly Dao Committee. He said seriously: "Hello, Miss Sun. I am Power Heavenly Dao. When you see this video, you may have lost a memory..."</p>

    <p>The video left by Heavenly Dao made the girl feel even more horrified.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao lower realm...</p>

    <p>She had never heard of such a thing.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is.</p>

    <p>This is actually related to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that Heavenly Dao is owned by classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels like there's a lot of information!</p>

    <p>However, after watching the second video left by Heavenly Dao, she had a clearer understanding of the entire incident.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao's narrative perspective is different. It adds a lot of details based on Lord Diulei's narrative.</p>

    <p>Because the memories of all Heavenly Dao are shared. When the death Heavenly Dao has been with the girl, the memory of the death Heavenly Dao also flows into the minds of other Heavenly Dao simultaneously.</p>

    <p>So the narration of the power Heavenly Dao is actually what the death Heavenly Dao saw when he was accompanying the girl.</p>

    <p>Now. The last USB flash drive is left...</p>

    <p>It was sent by senior Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>I wonder what kind of details the senior Zhuo Yi will add to her?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong replaced the USB drive out of curiosity.</p>

    <p>Here. Another video...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi recorded it for her while standing.</p>

    <p>However, after clicking the play button, Sun Rong felt like she was hit by a screen attack: "Hello, Master's Wife, when you see this video, you may have lost a memory..."</p>

    <p>From the narrative between Lord Diulei and Heavenly Dao, she already knew that Zhuo Yi's master was actually Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then doesn't that make Master's Wife...</p>

    <p>The girl's face suddenly turned red!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that his brain was a little confused. He could no longer continue listening. He closed the computer with a bang.</p>

    <p>Not for other reasons.</p>

    <p>It's because Zhuo Yi's narrative process is a bit "obscene." He laughed like an aunt throughout the whole process. It's completely different from the serious Zhuo Yi senior she knows in daily life!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Senior. He actually has such a side...</p>

    <p>The girl felt incredible.</p>

    <p>When he came to his senses, Sun Rong found that the screen of his laptop had cracked because he had turned it off too hard.</p>

    <p>This movement directly alerted Mr. Sun, the boss next door.</p>

    <p>The old man instinctively thought that his granddaughter had fallen off the bed. He quickly came over to check on the situation.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong? Are you okay?" Boss Sun opened the door and came in. His face was full of worry.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until I saw Sun Rong sitting upright on the bed that I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"I'm fine, grandpa... I just turned off the computer too hard..." the girl said.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. It's just a computer. Just get another one."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun looked at Sun Rong. He felt that something was wrong: "Rongrong. Why is your face... so red?"</p>

    <p>"Red... is it red..." Sun Rong suddenly became nervous.</p>

    <p>She thought of Zhuo Yi's words about "Master's Wife" just now, and her heart beat uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>There is a heart rate monitoring device on the side. Sun Rong's heartbeat and blood pressure are increasing rapidly.</p>

    <p>The entire machine even sounded an alarm.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun was extremely anxious instantly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was very puzzled.</p>

    <p>This was fine just now. Why is the data suddenly abnormal again?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Five or six minutes later, the doctor on duty invited Sun Yiyuan outside the ward after examining Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun was nervous for a while, but he still showed a prepared expression: "Doctor... tell me, what is the problem with my granddaughter? I am already... prepared."</p>

    <p>"No. Don't worry, Mr. Sun. I have said it before. Miss Sun is very healthy. There is nothing wrong with her." The doctor shook his head.</p>

    <p>"But her heartbeat was abnormally fast..."</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. Does Ms. Sun have someone she likes?" the doctor asked bluntly.</p>

    <p>"There have always been many people pursuing Rongrong. But I have never seen Rongrong really fall in love with anyone." The old man shook his head.</p>

    <p>"Really?" The doctor smiled meaningfully.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is not stupid. The doctor has already made it so obvious. It is impossible for him not to guess: "Doctor, you mean..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, she is in love."</p>

    <p>"In love?" Mr. Boss Sun was surprised: "Which boy is this from? How much do you like him?"</p>

    <p>"How fast my heart beats. How much I like it."</p>

    <p>The doctor said concisely: "But as for who the person you like is, Mr. Sun has to ask it himself."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Thank you doctor..." Boss Sun nodded.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This night was destined to be a sleepless night for Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>He never thought that his precious granddaughter would be so attracted to someone...</p>

    <p>Of course. This "person."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun guessed it intuitively.</p>

    <p>Considering the girl's feelings, he did not directly ask Sun Rong who he liked.</p>

    <p>But according to Boss Sun, the answer is already obvious.</p>

    <p>She spent so much effort to save her granddaughter. She even sent her gifts.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid there's something like a confession video in the USB flash drive...</p>

    <p>That's reasonable!</p>

    <p>Everything makes sense!</p>

    <p>In the middle of the night, Mr. Boss Sun paced back and forth in front of the bed in the room next to Sun Rong. He was thinking hard about his words.</p>

    <p>Around 2 a.m. on Wednesday, December 2nd.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei received a message from Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan: "Zhenjun. I'm sorry to bother you so late. I'm very grateful to the Office of Strategic Deception for helping my Sun family. But after all, my granddaughter is only 16 years old... so. I will never agree to Zhenjun and Rongrong's marriage!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "</p>
