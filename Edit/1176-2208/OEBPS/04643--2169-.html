  <h1>Chapter 2169 Small Town Alchemist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Relying on the special use of his own luck. Qin Zhong accurately deduced Mr. Canghu's next move.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu is well versed in the history of cultivation. So it is not surprising at all to know the primitive and exciting ancient alchemy technique of active volcano alchemy.</p>

    <p>The history of modern human cultivation has been shaped by the continuous efforts and attempts of generations of ancestors. It has been updated and iterated. This is even more true when looking into the future.</p>

    <p>For modern human monks, the future path of cultivation will only become more scientific and convenient.</p>

    <p>So please never look down on those old-era monks who hid in remote areas and worked hard to study various cultivation techniques in a dark environment.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, some people jokingly call them "small town alchemists", "small town weapon refiners", and "small town formation masters." But little do they know that the development of every skill tree in modern human technology is inseparable from these." The branches cultivated by the efforts of small town residents.</p>

    <p>The more colorful and plump the fruits are that grow on the tops of big trees, the more you should be in awe of these little-known small town families.</p>

    <p>Forefathers planted trees for future generations to enjoy the shade. These are the most simple and easy-to-understand principles, but some people don't understand them.</p>

    <p>So do they really not understand?</p>

    <p>No. They understand better than anyone else. They just like to pretend they understand.</p>

    <p>Fanning the wind and igniting the fire. Provoking conflicts between high-level monks and low-level monks. This is the fundamental purpose of these "satirists."</p>

    <p>He looks smarter than everyone else, but in fact he is worse than everyone else.</p>

    <p>On the way to Fuyun Town, Xiang Yi listened to Qin Zhong's various analyzes and thoughts. His respect for Qin Zhong couldn't help but deepen.</p>

    <p>He is nearly ten years younger than Qin Zhong. He thought he had seen a lot. But in fact, after teaming up with Qin Zhong for a long time, Xiang Yi gradually found that his behavioral logic and way of thinking on certain things were still too naive.</p>

    <p>His girlfriend Lin Wan has always said that he is childish. Now Xiang Yi can feel some differences between them from Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Although he feels that men are sometimes childish, which is a sign of acting coquettishly towards the person they like, but sometimes they are untimely childish, which makes them look a little giant.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi feels that he has not yet reached the stage of "giant baby." However, the charm of a mature man exuding from Qin Zhong reminds him.</p>

    <p>I still have a lot to learn.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mr. Canghu had already arrived near Fuyun Town with a convoy of medicinal materials he hired. The scene in front of him horrified Mr. Canghu.</p>

    <p>Under the construction of Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Fuyun Town has begun to take shape. It cannot be described by the word "town" at all.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Mr. Canghu thought of the classic movie line "This is eight years old!?"</p>

    <p>Yes. In the eyes of Mr. Canghu, this is no longer a small town. Everything in front of him is too gorgeous. There are NPC guards stationed on the towering defensive towers at the four entrances of the city in the southeast, northwest and northwest.</p>

    <p>Level 60 np guard</p>

    <p>It can be said that he is an existence at the level of an old boss on the map. He works as a sentinel in a place called "Floating Cloud Town."</p>

    <p>This is not the most outrageous thing. The most outrageous thing is that Mr. Canghu is passing by this moat lake.</p>

    <p>That's right. This is not a moat. It's a lake.</p>

    <p>Surrounded by water. Bottomless.</p>

    <p>The way leading to the city gate is a wide main road paved with a well-constructed aura barrier. It is very solid. There is an endless stream of people coming and going on it.</p>

    <p>Once the town is in danger, the aura barrier can be retracted instantly. And everyone on this main road will fall into the bottomless lake at the same time.</p>

    <p>While passing by the road, Mr. Canghu also discovered a huge shadow swimming under the lake. This was a creature comparable in size to a giant dragon. It was hiding under the lake.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu's level was too low. He could only see the huge shadow of this water monster. When his sight focused on it, the level displayed in the level column was "???."</p>

    <p>The water monster with a level of three question marks has become the second solid line of defense for Fuyun Town in addition to this exaggerated moat.</p>

    <p>This is a monster kept in captivity by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was the monster that was locked up in the dungeon after Wang Ling acquired the identity of prison leader. Wang Ling discovered that this monster could be tamed and raised.</p>

    <p>Just feed it with blood.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling lacks most is p</p>

    <p>Moreover, the p he lost can be quickly recovered by resting and swallowing pills that restore blood in proportion. Therefore, feeding this tameable monster will only temporarily deduct some of his own health for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this health value is just a bunch of game data. It is not valuable.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>I fed myself a little over 100 million.</p>

    <p>Turn this little guy into a big guy</p>

    <p>And it wasn't until Wang Ling that this little guy grew up that he was shocked to discover that the prototype of this little guy was actually a mutated blood-swallowing god Kun.</p>

    <p>Because they are too big, there is no place to raise them.</p>

    <p>So after discussing with Sun Rong, Sun Rong decided to change the moat of Fuyun Town into a moat lake as a temporary place to house this big guy.</p>

    <p>Of course, the moat lake is also conservative. Because according to Sun Rong's plan, the moat lake will eventually evolve into a moat sea and expand its scope again.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the existence of the city protection sea can also help Fuyun Town add a trade port, increase additional economic benefits and seafood exchanges, and turn Fuyun Town, which was originally surrounded by mountainous areas, into a coastal city.</p>

    <p>This will not only greatly promote the Maritime Silk Road in Fuyun Town, but also greatly expand the local tourism industry. It will be very helpful to the happiness index of urban residents.</p>

    <p>So why is it said that Fuyun Town is now the safest place in the entire Itinerant Immortal game world?</p>

    <p>Not just because of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's even more because the guardian beast of this "small town" is the blood-swallowing god Kun.</p>

    <p>According to the original game settings, it is not easy to cultivate the blood-swallowing god Kun. In the early stage, it is a very gold-swallowing deal. Because the blood-swallowing god Kun consumes at least 50,000 drops from players every day in its infancy. Blood.</p>

    <p>This amount of blood alone is not something that ordinary people can afford.</p>

    <p>But fifty thousand drops of blood is nothing to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He even fed the blood-swallowing god Kun to full capacity.</p>

    <p>As for the reason why even the sentries Mr. Canghu saw were level 60, that would be a better explanation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This wave has fed the blood-swallowing god Kun. Since the blood-swallowing god Kun is already the defending beast of Fuyun Town, the level of three question marks directly caused the local NPC to become involuntarily involved.</p>

    <p>As a result, the level of NP regionalization has been greatly improved.</p>

    <p>So, when Mr. Canghu entered the pharmacy in Fuyun Town and saw the level 80 pharmacy owner, he was completely stunned.</p>

    <p>Barbie. What is this? Is anyone here? Is anyone here?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Mr. Canghu fell into deep thought. 3 question mark-level city guardian beasts. 60-level sentinels. 80-level drug store bosses and 1-level city lords.</p>

    <p>This Fuyun Town is really interesting</p>
