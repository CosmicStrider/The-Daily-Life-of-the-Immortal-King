  <h1>Chapter 1957 Natural Catalyst</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A commotion near Wuxiang Peak quickly attracted the attention of the leader of the Wuxiang Sect on the mountain and his disciples.</p>

    <p>The sect leader's expression was obviously confused. It was clear that there were still three days before the sect competition. Why was the script of "Six major sects besieging Guangmingding" started to be staged now?</p>

    <p>And the crusade against Wuxiang Peak. This plot is completely out of their hands!</p>

    <p>"Master, what should we do now?" The disciples of Wuxiang Sect were all in suits and leather shoes. They were anxiously waiting for the situation of the leader of Wuxiang Sect. They did not have the magnanimity of elite cultivators at all. Their essence was still actors. They would act in accordance with the rules. Act according to the script. Of course, you will occasionally encounter unexpected situations. You can also adapt to circumstances.</p>

    <p>But who could have imagined the situation of being besieged in front of them. Twenty-one peaks including the Number 2 Proving Ground. Except for their Wuxiang Peak, the other twenty peaks actually formed an alliance in a short period of time and attacked them.</p>

    <p>Although their Wuxiang Peak is the number one peak, the overall strength of all the disciples in the sect is also the strongest. Not only that, Qu Shuling, the top genius among the new elites, has also joined their Wuxiang Peak. But in the face of such a beast-like formation, can they It's hard to say if you can't resist it.</p>

    <p>"Why did they gather all of a sudden?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan witnessed this scene. The two people, who had always regarded themselves as smart, saw the huge mountain guardian spirit rushing towards the entrance of Wuxiang Peak. As the earthquake shook the earth, their eyes also fell into a dull state.</p>

    <p>They didn't expect the scene before them to happen. They couldn't figure out why the other summits united to attack Wuxiang Peak at this time.</p>

    <p>And now all the attention is attracted by the fierce battle at the entrance of the mountain. The light effects of various magical weapons are intertwined and bombarded together. They shine through from a distance. Even under the clear sky, the explosions are each brilliant and brilliant.</p>

    <p>The ear-piercing sonic booms were heard endlessly, accompanied by the roars of many people. Li Changzhe seemed to have heard a few roars.</p>

    <p>"Come on! Kill the boss in this dungeon! Come to me from the strategy team!"</p>

    <p>"As long as you clear the level, you can get the code for the beta code that will not delete files! Give it to me!"</p>

    <p>This was the voice coming from Chen Chao and Guo Hao. The two had no idea that this was a training ground in the spirit world. They led people to fight in. And they were completely fearless in the face of the guarding mountain spirit. They just regarded it as a game.</p>

    <p>Although the rest of the people had no idea what the two were talking about, they saw that these two practitioners in the Foundation Building stage were charging at the forefront.</p>

    <p>A sentence echoed in everyone's hearts in unison.</p>

    <p>--Damn it. It's on fire!</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the people in the Twenty Peaks were actually brought into the momentum by Chen Chao and Guo Hao, two men from the Foundation Building period. They were not afraid even in the face of the guardian mountain spirit and charged forward together.</p>

    <p>Even the guardian mountain spirit was frightened. For the first time, it felt that it was so out of place. Even the practitioners in the Foundation Building period did not take it seriously.</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that it is also an invited actor. Even under such circumstances, it cannot make a fatal move. It can only resist as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"Our luck... is really good. In this head-on battle, the mountain guards were attracted away. Wouldn't it be convenient for us to collect resources?" Li Changzhe scratched his head. When he came back to his senses, he found Wang Ling Already walking at the front alone.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Classmate Wang Ling. Just wait for me!"</p>

    <p>He shouted. Then he quickly grabbed Zhang Linyan and chased after him.</p>

    <p>Even Tieyi and the others were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Since mining in the mine, this is another scene that no one expected.</p>

    <p>Is it a coincidence...</p>

    <p>It should be said. Wang Ling, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan are really lucky.</p>

    <p>"By the way. Li Changzhe. You just mentioned luck. I also feel that our luck today seems to be particularly good. I heard that classmate Wang Ling has always been called the Sixty Mascot. I don't know if it has something to do with it. Tie?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan tilted her head. Her watery gaze passed over Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remained silent.</p>

    <p>Based on his experience, it is most correct not to get involved in the topic at this time.</p>

    <p>"Haha, maybe it's just my pure luck, you are just influenced by me. Before I came to Songhai City through the city teleportation array this time, I drew a card and got gold! And it's not the kind of guaranteed one! Directly hit the target with one shot!"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe answered confidently.</p>

    <p>He really felt that he was very lucky today. Moreover, it was a combination of natural luck. It had nothing to do with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As expected of you...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly raised his eyebrows. He was quite satisfied with Li Changzhe's blind confidence.</p>

    <p>At the very least, it's a good cover.</p>

    <p>"Now Wuxiang Peak is besieged from the front. Don't we have as much resources in the mountains behind us as we want?" Zhang Linyan said.</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, this is true. However, we must also pay attention to environmental protection issues." Li Changzhe said: "All the maps in the trial site are transplanted from the real world. In other words, this is originally a natural ecological area. Moderate Collecting is okay. Excessive mining is not advisable."</p>

    <p>"That's nonsense. You don't have to say that." Zhang Linyan rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>All things have animism. As an archer, she is very familiar with it.</p>

    <p>While she was talking to Li Changzhe, she was also using her peripheral vision to read a lot of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As always, Wang Ling talks as little as before. But the more this happens, the more Zhang Linyan has the illusion that Wang Ling is covered by a mysterious veil.</p>

    <p>Now that she thought about it carefully, she felt that there seemed to be an indescribable strange feeling during the first internal beta test of the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>She felt that Wang Ling was hinting at her actions. But she didn't feel that it was...</p>

    <p>"Don't be stunned. Come and help me! There are important materials to repair the spirit gathering formation over there!" At this time, Li Changzhe's voice came again.</p>
    
    <p>He pointed to a cliff wall emitting a ghostly blue light, lingzhi-shaped jade stone and said. "Cuishan Jade! There is such a precious treasure here!"</p>
    
    <p>Zhang Linyan was shocked again. This is a natural jade that naturally contains a strong aura of heaven and earth. It is ranked fourth level. Its value is comparable to a low-grade holy artifact!</p>

    <p>However, such priceless treasures are naturally very delicate. They need to pay attention to methods when collecting them. If they are collected through violent means, the value will be reduced by more than half of the original value.</p>

    <p>As for the identification and collection methods of various types of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, they are taught in the nature class of cultivation High School. As elite students, Cuishan Jade is certainly precious. But Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan still have this ability to identify.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is one thing that Li Changzhe and Li Changzhe did not learn from textbooks at all.</p>

    <p>That is this Cuishan Jade.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Wang Ling just passed by, it suddenly grew rapidly from the gap...</p>

    <p>The spiritual power in Wang Ling's body is amazing, especially when in the natural environment. Wang Ling has a physique that can produce rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures. This makes the spiritual power in his body become a natural spiritual power. plant catalyst.</p>

    <p>However, under normal circumstances, due to the suppression by Talisman, the physique of this spiritual plant catalyst will not be easily displayed.</p>

    <p>This Cuishan Jade suddenly grew out just now. Wang Ling was also shocked...</p>

    <p>At the same time, this also means that there is another thing. That is the Talisman currently attached to Wang Ling. It has reached a critical point on the verge of failure.</p>

    <p>We must find a way to complete the replacement as soon as possible...</p>
