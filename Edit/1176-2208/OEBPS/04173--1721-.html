  <h1>Chapter 1721: Little harm. Extremely insulting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>People with the thought plague would not expect that their beards would be cut off before they entered the body. This is obviously a trap. But it is too late to say anything at this time.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan, he will lead the more than 90 thought-plagued people on their side to enter Sun Rong's body. After confirming that nothing happens, they will greet the outside world. The rest of the thought-plagued people will then enter Sun Rong in the body. Eventually, joint suppression is formed.</p>

    <p>But now it knew that it had been fooled. And the most outrageous thing was that after learning that it had been cut off, Sun Rong immediately opened the window and called out: "Come in, brothers!"</p>

    <p>The thought plaguer who first invaded Sun Rong's body never expected that Sun Rong was actually pretending to be himself...</p>

    <p>Then the next scene is like the calabash kid saving grandpa.</p>

    <p>After hearing Sun Rong's greeting, the other thought plaguers lurking in the villa thought that the plan was successful. They all separated from their bodies and began to get into Sun Rong's body...</p>

    <p>Then one by one, they all fell into the palm of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, facing the gazes of Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Heavenly Dao, these thought-epidemic people are trembling. They feel like they are surrounded by three Buddhas of the West.</p>

    <p>"You have numbers, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying looked at the thought plaguer that first broke away from Chen Xiaomu's body and planned to invade Sun Rong and asked.</p>

    <p>The thought plaguer snorted and refused to say another word. They have a self-destruction mechanism. If they fail to complete the task, they can kill themselves and end their lives.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that they were suppressed by Wang Ling as soon as they came in. Their maggot-like bodies were unable to move.</p>

    <p>"Don't say it, right? I have plenty of ways to make you say it." Wang Ying raised the corners of his lips and showed his signature devilish smile.</p>

    <p>"What does Master Wang Ying want to do..." Death Heavenly Dao had a bad premonition.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. I just suddenly felt hungry and wanted to eat something." Wang Ying said, crossing his arms.</p>

    <p>Then, Sun Rong's voice sounded from the Sword Spirit space. She asked cooperatively: "What does Master of Shadows want to eat? I'll let the head maid prepare it."</p>

    <p>"Mustard squid, charcoal grilled large squid, charcoal grilled squid tentacles, fried squid with green pepper, and braised squid flowers." Wang Ying ordered a series of these dishes. They were all related to squid.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ling, Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that the logo of most creatures in Old Dominator is the iconic squid-like tentacles.</p>

    <p>The same goes for the Thought Plague. Although it looks like a maggot, it still retains a tentacle-like structure at the end.</p>

    <p>Even after they possess a person's body, they can still find the mark of the tentacles in the possessed person's pupils.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying plans to do, in addition to ordering a bunch of squid-related dishes, is also to establish a spiritual connection and build the same spiritual space as these ninety-seven thought-epidemic people.</p>

    <p>The ultimate goal is actually to "share the taste"...</p>

    <p>That is, when Wang Ying is eating these squid dishes, these thinkers will also taste the taste of these squid dishes.</p>

    <p>This approach is not evil...</p>

    <p>It can be said that in the true sense, it is not very lethal but extremely insulting.</p>

    <p>Although Old Dominator has nothing to do with squid in nature. But there is still an illusion as if one's own people are eating one's own people...</p>

    <p>"You... are you still a human being?" the leader of the thought plague yelled.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I'm not." Wang Ying spread his hands and smiled.</p>

    <p>He was originally the shadow of Wang Ling. In theory, he was indeed not a human being. So Wang Ying himself didn't feel much about this.</p>

    <p>"How about it? Are you still unwilling to tell me? I have other ways."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying stared at it without any mercy.</p>

    <p>This thought-plagued person can see it. Wang Ying is not the type to negotiate. Instead, if he does not do what the other party says, he will 100% be severely punished... and the other party's punishment is not ordinary. punishments. Rather, they are crooked tactics specifically designed to target different groups.</p>

    <p>Let them taste the taste of squid. This psychological rejection is more painful than dying directly.</p>

    <p>So, the leader of the thought plague sighed and finally gave up the resistance: "My job number is 003."</p>

    <p>"003?" Wang Ying: "Speak clearly. What is 003."</p>

    <p>"There are 6 first batch of thought-epidemics born from the first batch of mothers. I am Number 003." The thought-epidemic with job number 003 replied.</p>

    <p>Everything was the same as Wang Ling's previous conjecture. Previously, he felt that the mind-plagued person possessing Chen Xiaomu's body was not an ordinary thing. But now his conjecture was indeed confirmed.</p>

    <p>"In other words, do you know where the mother's body is?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes..." 003 replied: "But even if you can find the location of the mother body through me, it will be useless."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Death Heavenly Dao frowned.</p>

    <p>003: "Although the Thought Plague is a parasitic Old Dominator, it has a mother body that continuously produces new Thought Plague. But the mother body is not the only one. Even if you find the mother body and kill it, the mother body can also transfer rights and create in an instant. A new mother body was created. After the original mother body was disconnected from me, I don't know the location of the newly created mother body..."</p>

    <p>Although it has long been expected that as a part of the Old Dominator system, these mind plaguers who appear out of thin air may not be that easy to deal with. However, the method of transferring maternal rights is indeed beyond Wang Ling's expectations.</p>

    <p>In other words, if the treatment is not clean this time, it is very likely that the mother body will slip through the net... unless the mother body can be completely killed, leaving no room for her to pass on her rights.</p>

    <p>But from 003's point of view, this is an impossible task.</p>

    <p>"There are many ways to transfer the power of the mother body. You can't be careful at all." Number 003 said: "And you also know it. Master Sotos is behind this matter. Unless you have a way to prevent the mother body from invading A host. Eradicate it... let it disappear completely from all world lines and timelines. Otherwise, the Thought Plague will exist forever."</p>

    <p>These words made Wang Ling's brows twitch slightly.</p>

    <p>Because this method seems a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>And it sounds more like revenge.</p>

    <p>Because that was the method he used against Bai Zhe at the beginning.</p>

    <p>He wiped out the existence of all world lines in Bai Zhi.</p>

    <p>The only thing I didn't expect was that the other party's resentment was too strong and too deep. He could actually communicate with the will of the universe and forcefully figure it out.</p>

    <p>"We have our own solutions. It's not your business." Death Heavenly Dao snorted.</p>

    <p>At this time, Number 003 suddenly laughed sinisterly: "I don't understand. Even if you really have a way to kill the mother in one go, can you really do it again? He is now possessed. If you want to uproot us from the body of the scientist named Wang Ming and prevent human cultivators from being enslaved... then you must completely eliminate this person named Wang Ming."</p>
