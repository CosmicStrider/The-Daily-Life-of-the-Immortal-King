  <h1>Chapter 1732 New Talisman? Wang Ling: Then I won't be sleepy anymore!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When this steel chrysalis-like sky-level laboratory appeared in the sky, although the commanders in the laboratory had realized that the laboratory had been exposed, they were not completely in disarray.</p>

    <p>After all, this is not the first time that an invisibility failure has happened. This is just like when a star on Weibo suddenly made some gossip, which attracted a large number of people to eat melons and directly crashed the app. The same is true for the failure of invisible mechanisms. What is needed is to step up efforts to get the internal programmers responsible for laboratory protection to quickly fix the problem.</p>

    <p>As the mother nest where the bones of the Yusan family are stored, the Tian-level laboratory also has the largest number of programmers. Under normal circumstances, it only takes a few seconds to correct the failure of the invisibility mechanism.</p>

    <p>But this time... these programmers with bright heads suddenly discovered that the mother nest was completely out of their control.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of bald programmers were frantically typing on the keyboard to perfect and repair the defense mechanism of the Sky Level Laboratory. However, after typing in these formation codes, there was no reaction at all!</p>

    <p>Why does the invisibility mechanism bug take so long to fix this time?</p>

    <p>It's over. Now the year-end bonus is completely gone!</p>

    <p>Their hearts are broken one by one.</p>

    <p>"Oops! It's not a bug problem! It's because we were invaded by a powerful brainwave! The stealth formation and teleportation formation used for encryption defense failed!" Soon, a programmer slapped the naked head. He screamed as if he had realized something.</p>

    <p>And when the radar inside the laboratory scanned the source of the abnormal brain waves, the camera immediately focused on Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Master Wu Xin?"</p>

    <p>Long ago, Baobai Group had already reported that the body control of the young man in front of him named Wang Ming had completely fallen into the hands of a senior named "Master Wu Xin."</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ming showed up and used brain waves to attack the Tian-level laboratory, many people here didn't react for a while. It felt unreal.</p>

    <p>"What's going on...why did Mr. Wu Xin attack us? We are his own people!"</p>

    <p>"Idiot! This is not Master Wu Xin! This young man has regained control of his body!"</p>

    <p>"Fuck. Isn't he just an ordinary person? Lord Wu Xin is the Eternal One!"</p>

    <p>For a time, many people started discussing it.</p>

    <p>I don't understand what's going on with this wave of backlash followed by another backlash.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming stood on the reddish-brown cemetery ground.</p>

    <p>The clarion call for the counterattack has officially begun.</p>

    <p>After regaining control of his body, he felt that his mental power and brain waves were greater than before!</p>

    <p>"Is it because... of the divine brain?"</p>

    <p>Now, Master Wu Xin was countered by him. But the incomplete divine brain that invaded his mental space was still in his body.</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Ming, who has now successfully regained control of his body, has also become the new owner of this incomplete brain.</p>

    <p>And given time, the brain will gradually recover!</p>

    <p>His brain will be even more powerful than before!</p>

    <p>So. At the same time that Wang Ming used the wasp with strengthened skull to open a gap in the Tian-level laboratory, countless old Japanese creatures appeared in the Tian-level laboratory and began to protect the Tian-level laboratory!</p>

    <p>These old Japanese creatures have never been seen before. They are more like synthetic creatures. They have evil eyeballs full of tentacles. But behind them are dragonborn and dragon tails. They are actually a combination of dragons and creatures from the old factions.</p>

    <p>They flapped their dragon wings and poured out of the opened hole. While surrounding the laboratory, they also formed a torrent and attacked Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming stood there with his arms folded and touched his chin.</p>

    <p>Now his brain waves are stronger. Of course he won't feel scared. On the other hand, it is mainly because of the "matryoshka linkage" relationship formed in his body.</p>

    <p>Because it is in his spiritual space. Sun Rong and Aohai are still in it. And in the sword spirit space of Sun Rong, there are Wang Ying, Death Heavenly Dao and his strongest brother Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>There are so many big guys. The matryoshka doll seems to be inside his body. Of course he has nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. We have to find a way to get in. And it's best not to destroy the brood first. I have a feeling that besides the dragon bones, there may be information I'm interested in inside."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Well, maybe this information will help me research the new Talisman."</p>

    <p>New Talisman?</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling was only moderately interested in bone snatching.</p>

    <p>I originally thought of snatching away the dragon bones and razing the entire Dragon Cemetery to the ground.</p>

    <p>But now, since Wang Ming said that there is information on developing a new Talisman in this Tian-level laboratory, the situation has obviously reversed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling As soon as he heard this, he felt no sleepiness at all.</p>

    <p>After saying this, a pool of spring water immediately appeared at Wang Ming's feet. Then Sun Rong appeared directly.</p>

    <p>"Why did you come out?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't come out. It was my classmate Wang Ling who..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"I see. It's my brother who wants to come out of your body."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that there was something wrong with what he said. But now is obviously not the time to argue with this: "Let me escort Brother Ming in. My classmate Wang Ling just said to leave it to them."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling sitting behind him, he was of course extremely relieved. He didn't need to think too much and just rushed forward.</p>

    <p>"Wow!" A group of blue mist rose from Wang Ming's feet. Finally, it formed a group of blue clouds. Sun Rong formed a blue motorcycle in front of Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming has not yet reacted.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is already sitting in the driver's seat. Wearing a helmet.</p>

    <p>This is a blue motorcycle transformed with Aohai's spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming never thought that a girl could have such a chic side!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, get on!" At this time, Sun Rong's clothes also successfully changed into motorcycle body-shaping clothes, which highlighted her good figure to the fullest.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's Adam's apple rolled.</p>

    <p>He was extremely self-conscious. After putting on Aohai's differentiated helmet and sitting in the back seat.</p>

    <p>He did not hug Sun Rong's waist. Instead, he crossed his arms, assuming a very cold posture.</p>

    <p>As a man who already has a partner.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming feels that he should be more self-disciplined.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, sit tight. We're going to set off now!" Sun Rong didn't think too much about it, she pushed on the bike's frame with a long, slender stomp, and directly turned the throttle to the highest position.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>When the roar of a long dragon came from the engine, an astonishing dragon-shaped water column instantly surged out from the jet port at the rear of the motorcycle!</p>

    <p>Directly aim at the huge hole that was smashed open in the heaven-level laboratory and attack. Go straight to Huanglong!</p>

    <p>At the same time. Wang Ling stands at the rear.</p>

    <p>He watched Sun Rong ride away on a handsome motorcycle. He saw her turn into a small black dot in a short moment, putting a long distance away from him.</p>

    <p>Then. He summoned Jingke at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Sword. Lord." Jingke bowed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say much. He just looked at the synthetic creatures in the sky. He said calmly: "Clear the place. Leave no one behind."</p>
