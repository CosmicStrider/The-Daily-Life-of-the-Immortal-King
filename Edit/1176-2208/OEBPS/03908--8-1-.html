  <h1>Sun Rong sleeps with Wang Nuan} Extra 8:1</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Speaking of which, this doesn't seem to be the first time the girl has spent the night in the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>The last time I had a sleepover happened during my freshman year...</p>

    <p>But that was an accident.</p>

    <p>Due to overtraining, he suddenly fainted during the visit. Father Wang moved Sun Rong to Wang Ling's bed to rest.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ling happened not to be at home.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong fell asleep on Wang Ling's bed all night. He didn't wake up until the next morning.</p>

    <p>Although this was six or seven years ago, it sounds like a long time ago.</p>

    <p>But this matter still lingers in Sun Rong's heart.</p>

    <p>Even now when I think about it, my heartbeat is still accelerating.</p>

    <p>Seeing the girl's hesitant look, the couple in pajamas looked at each other tacitly.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly started his performance.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Look at each of you. Let Rongrong decide for herself. Don't embarrass her."</p>

    <p>"Go! Go! Go."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang pushed Father Wang away. She walked over and pulled Sun Rong in: "Don't listen to your uncle's nonsense. It's getting late now. You go back alone. I'm worried about safety."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled bitterly: "Actually, I'll be fine..."</p>

    <p>"Of course I'm not worried about your safety, Rongrong. I'm worried about the safety of others. It's going to be the Chinese New Year soon. It's not good to see too much blood."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang said earnestly: "With this sword strike, not all those bad guys will be turned into scum. It will also bring a lot of trouble to the forensic comrades' identification work! How about just staying for one night? Sleep with Ah Nuan. After eating Go back after breakfast."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought about it carefully. It felt like it was too kind to refuse. So he nodded and agreed: "Okay... I'll just listen to auntie!"</p>

    <p>During the whole process, Wang Nuan was watching the show on the second floor.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang, one of them plays blackface and the other plays whiteface. It's an old routine. She has long been used to it.</p>

    <p>Then the couple hurried back to their bedroom on the third floor.</p>

    <p>The rest is enough for Wang Nuan to handle alone.</p>

    <p>Although this girl is small, she is a ghost! Maybe she can help Wang Ling and Sun Rong go further.</p>

    <p>And if they intervene too much, it will easily get in the way.</p>

    <p>"You said... Ling Ling is drunk now. Could he..."</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about? Our son is also a reserved person. He won't wake up even if the sky falls after drinking. In this state, at least he won't wake up until tomorrow morning." Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling has drunk before?"</p>

    <p>"You forgot about licking the lids of wine bottles when you were a kid."</p>

    <p>"Oh... right!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang suddenly understood. She couldn't help laughing: "I also said at the time that my family's lingling is very good at ventriloquism!"</p>

    <p>"Shh! Keep your voice down... Rongrong is at home! It's not good for a girl to hear it."</p>

    <p>Father Wang smiled meaningfully.</p>

    <p>Most of the bedside conversations between the couple consist of idle talk and laughter.</p>

    <p>The sound insulation of Wang's villa is indeed very good.</p>

    <p>The two of them actually spoke not very loudly. It should not be audible under normal circumstances.</p>

    <p>However, what neither Father Wang nor Mother Wang expected was...</p>

    <p>The realm of Wang Nuan and Sun Rong is indeed high.</p>

    <p>The two girls didn't eavesdrop on purpose...</p>

    <p>It's just Wang Nuan's bedroom. The top of it happens to be the master bedroom of Father Wang and Mother Wang on the third floor.</p>

    <p>Their hearing is really too sensitive.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Sister Rongrong, now you understand my pain." Wang Nuan looked helpless.</p>

    <p>"eh..." Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However. Actually Sun Rong thinks it's not bad.</p>

    <p>As long as you distract yourself and concentrate on other things, you won't hear the noise upstairs.</p>

    <p>"Here, Sister Rongrong. This is yours." Wang Nuan helped Sun Rong prepare the dental appliances.</p>

    <p>After Sun Rong took it, he felt something was wrong with the dental equipment: "Ah Nuan. Did you take it by mistake? These dental cups and toothbrushes seem to have been used..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you discovered it!" Wang Nuan stuck out his tongue, pretending to be shocked.</p>

    <p>"Could this be..." Sun Rong immediately thought of something.</p>

    <p>His face turned red again. "Yes. It's what my brother uses." Wang Nuan said calmly.</p>

    <p>"I... how can I use Wang Ling's stuff..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Sister Rongrong, I won't tease you anymore." Wang Nuan chuckled. Then he replaced Sun Rong with brand new toiletries.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was brushing her teeth. Ah Nuan girl was looking at her with her arms crossed. She looked like a little kid.</p>

    <p>While rinsing his mouth, Wang Nuan suddenly asked a question: "Sister Rongrong, tell me, when a couple kisses, they don't feel dirty. Why do you need to separate the dental appliances when you brush your teeth?"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong choked immediately after listening to it. He almost swallowed the mouthwash in his mouth.</p>

    <p>She heard it.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl is herself within herself.</p>

    <p>I suddenly sighed in my heart. Today's primary school students are too premature.</p>

    <p>After a simple shower, Wang Nuan sent Sun Rong a new set of pajamas. Sun Rong recognized it at a glance: "Aren't these Wang Ling's White Rabbit pajamas?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Sister Rongrong. My mother knows that my brother likes this. She bought several sets for my brother to keep. This set is new. My brother has never worn it." Wang Nuan said with a bad smile: "You still say. I want to wear what my brother wore. I'll go steal one for you right now..."</p>

    <p>"Don't... I didn't think so..." Facing Wang Nuan. Sun Rong felt like he couldn't argue.</p>

    <p>This girl really sees everything so clearly. It's as if she can look straight into people's hearts.</p>

    <p>There are always some questions that make people want to have to explain them, but they seem very embarrassing after they are explained.</p>

    <p>The washing work is completed. It is already 11 o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong put on the White Rabbit one-piece pajamas and lay on the bed with Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>When she was washing up earlier, the little girl's noisy energy seemed to have been exhausted. Now when she was lying on the bed, she had nothing to say at all.</p>

    <p>But in fact. Sun Rong has always had a feeling.</p>

    <p>This was the reason why she agreed to stay one night.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is indeed difficult to reject such hospitality.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I also had a vague feeling that something was wrong with this little girl. She might want to say something to herself.</p>

    <p>But after lying on the bed, Wang Nuan was speechless. This made Sun Rong look a little helpless.</p>

    <p>There was no other way. She had no choice but to turn sideways, aim at Wang Nuan's side, and ask softly: "Ah Nuan? You should not be asleep yet... You deliberately wanted to keep me here. Do you want to say something to me?"</p>

    <p>For a long time, Wang Nuan did not reply.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong I thought Wang Nuan might have fallen asleep. Then I thought maybe I was thinking too much.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, Ah Nuan girl's voice suddenly sounded again. She was serious and a little serious: "Sister Rongrong, do you really like my brother that much..."</p>

    <p>"like..."</p>

    <p>"Then if one day my brother disappears, what will you do?"</p>

    <p>"I will wait until he comes back." Sun Rong answered calmly.</p>

    <p>But in fact.</p>

    <p>My heart is trembling.</p>

    <p>"I see."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan closed his eyes again.</p>

    <p>Reconfirming the girl's intentions is also part of the big plan she is about to implement.</p>

    <p>It's just that this plan won't start so soon.</p>

    <p>These questions made Sun Rong feel like a completely different Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what the little girl was planning. But one thing was certain. Ah Nuan was definitely not as simple as she seemed.</p>

    <p>This is Sun Rong's own intuition.</p>

    <p>And her intuition has always been accurate.</p>

    <p>"Ah, yes, Sister Rongrong."</p>

    <p>After asking a few serious questions, Wang Nuan's voice became lively again.</p>

    <p>And this. is the Ah Nuan girl that Sun Rong usually knows.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan: "Do you want to see what my brother is dreaming about now?"</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Nuan also turned around. He stared at Sun Rong with small eyes.</p>

    <p>The two women were facing each other under the covers.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is curious: "Wang Ling's dream?"</p>

    <p>"My brother used to be a light sleeper or not sleep at all. Now he has switched to Eternal Talisman. It is no problem to enter a deep sleep state. The dreams are naturally more colorful."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan narrowed his eyes and smiled: "If necessary, I can take you directly into my brother's dream."</p>
