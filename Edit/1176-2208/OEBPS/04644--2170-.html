  <h1>Chapter 2170 Bai Zhe is empty</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The On the ferry in the restricted area of the sea. Qiao Yanyuan put on his helmet. In this way, signals from outside the universe were secretly transmitted into the earth.</p>

    <p>This is a signal from Bai Zhe. Because the energy is too strong, only a part of Bai Zhe's power is transmitted here.</p>

    <p>When everything was ready, Qiao Yanyuan silently recited the password three times.</p>

    <p>"Don't answer. Don't answer. Don't answer"</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Right in front of him, a figure that resembled a lake appeared. It was illuminated by the bright moonlight and emitted astonishing spiritual energy fluctuations. Its movements seemed to have the potential to crush the sun, moon, and stars.</p>

    <p>It is the part of Bai Zhe Li Yongbo and Qiao Yanyuan's signaling device that is remotely projected to the earth.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Qiao, you did a good job." Bai Zhe spoke and praised Qiao Yanyuan who was kneeling on the ground.</p>

    <p>The unruly nature of the Dragon Clan is also passed down to the Dragonborn. They will not kneel down to anyone easily, unless this person is someone they consider to be a strong person and a follower.</p>

    <p>Facing Bai Zhe's body, Qiao Yanyuan knelt down directly, which represented his surrender to Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>"I am the Dragon Lord. I will devote myself wholeheartedly!" Qiao Yanyuan kowtowed.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe nodded with satisfaction. His body was radiating light. Even if he only differentiated an energy signal, it was amazing. The spiritual energy all over his body was majestic. After landing on the earth, even the weather of heaven and earth changed. The sky was like It was refined into a vision of surging aurora. The bright moonlight stretched across the void like chains.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>He snapped his fingers. Two rays of light shot directly into Qiao Yanyuan's two dragon horns.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan felt that his whole body was filled with spiritual energy. It was as if he had reached a new level online!</p>

    <p>Heavenly Ancestor!</p>

    <p>He actually reached the realm of Heavenly Ancestor!</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan can believe it.</p>

    <p>The realm that originally took him several epochs of hard work actually allowed him to break through in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>This is Bai Zhe's Everlasting Moonlight. It can directly reward spiritual energy through infusion. Only creatures with the same dragon bloodline can receive such a gift.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was shocked.</p>

    <p>He knew that Bai Zhe was powerful. But he didn't expect that Bai Zhe's strength had reached such an extent.</p>

    <p>Giving rewards casually is the realm of Heavenly Ancestor. So how strong is Bai Zhe's own strength now?</p>

    <p>For a time, he was full of expectations for the future of the Dragon Clan. He felt that the date of restoring the Dragon Clan and returning the Dragon Clan to the first race in the universe was not far away!</p>

    <p>The battle of destiny in the future!</p>

    <p>Just after Bai Zhe became the complete body of Yueguang Dragon!</p>

    <p>The dragon army joins forces with Fenmu Shen. They will surely create a new universe myth!</p>

    <p>"Xiao Qiao, from today on, you will be the general of our dragon clan. You will be given the title: Purple Sun Dragon Lord." Bai Zhe said.</p>

    <p>Because of the barrier outside the earth, his virtual body could only come to the earth in this tortuous way. The first thing he did when he came to the earth was to help Qiao Yanyuan further improve his combat power.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was flattered by this. He knew exactly what this meant.</p>

    <p>In the historical situation of the development of the Dragon Clan, apart from the three leaders of the Dragon Clan, Yueguang, Anniha, and Cangyuan, how many people can be appointed as Dragon Clan generals?</p>

    <p>Starting from the history of the dragon clan, you can count them on your fingers. Dragons who can be appointed as generals have made outstanding contributions to the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>This is equivalent to directly giving Qiao Yanyuan an establishment within the Dragon Clan system!</p>

    <p>Therefore, what makes Qiao Yanyuan panic is that he did not undergo several rounds of written examinations and interviews like the dragon generals in history. Instead, he was directly given such rights by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Do this. Is there really no problem?</p>

    <p>"Actual combat is the best interview."</p>

    <p>In this regard, Bai Zhe has already understood Qiao Yanyuan's concerns.</p>

    <p>He was able to survive after a head-on conflict with Wang Ling on Earth. This has proved Qiao Yanyuan's own ability. Even if his combat power is not as good as that of the dead fish eye, at least this is a rare person who can compete with Wang Ling. Wang Ling People who engage in short-term dealings.</p>

    <p>And this is why Bai Zhe fell in love with Qiao Yanyuan. It will take some time before he completes his evolution and reaches his ultimate form. That is why he also needs to make arrangements in many aspects to cause trouble to Wang Ling, thereby delaying time.</p>

    <p>Of course. This time Bai Zhe came to earth in a virtual form.</p>

    <p>The real purpose is naturally not to unilaterally announce that Qiao Yanyuan will be given a staff position under the Dragon Clan system and to enhance his overall combat power.</p>

    <p>There are other purposes as well.</p>

    <p>"My subordinates are bold to guess. The Dragon Lord trapped that dead fish eye into the game world. I'm afraid he has another purpose." Qiao Yanyuan also saw this.</p>

    <p>He immediately bowed and asked.</p>

    <p>"The game world can't trap him." He has played against Wang Ling several times. Bai Zhe knows the specific strength of Wang Ling. He set up the fog of reality in the game world. Let The data in the game world becomes real one by one.</p>

    <p>All his layouts seemed complicated, but Bai Zhe knew very well. The boy didn't pay attention to the obstacles he set at all.</p>

    <p>He designed all of this. The fundamental purpose is still for Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling can be temporarily attracted into the game world, his purpose will be achieved.</p>

    <p>Soon, his figure turned into a white light and disappeared from Qiao Yanyuan's eyes.</p>

    <p>He placed Qiao Yanyuan on the earth and used Qiao Yanyuan as a "transport" hidden on the earth in order to input his own energy signal to the earth so that he could discuss it carefully with Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Everything is within Bai Zhe's plan.</p>

    <p>In a secret and elegant pavilion surrounded by mountains on the outskirts of Songhai City. Yi Jianchuan brought Wang Muyu here.</p>

    <p>The turmoil in the maritime restricted area has not subsided. It is still in a confrontation. Both sides are in the wait-and-see stage. The fleet is still in a confrontation at the entrance to the maritime restricted area.</p>

    <p>However, judging from the situation, it is now completely deadlocked. No one dares to take the lead.</p>

    <p>The Sword Master predicted that this situation would probably not be fought, so he took Wang Muyu to the rear to rest, and called on the other generals to take charge of the frontline work.</p>

    <p>When there is a fight, you can call him again.</p>

    <p>Of course. He was sure that even if he didn't go, there wouldn't be any problems ahead. Because he could see that Yue Lingwei, Zhang Zhui was not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu has been living in the luxurious villa of the Sun Rong family since he came to the human world. This time he set foot in the elegant little pavilion, which gave him a sense of deformation.</p>

    <p>His master was a simple man. However, he was a dignified swordsman who lived in poverty and lived a happy life. He blended into this natural landscape. He felt the harmony of heaven and man. Wang Muyu felt that Yi Jianchuan exuded a cool feeling.</p>

    <p>Before coming, Yi Jianchuan had already asked all the idle people in the pavilion to leave, leaving him and Wang Muyu some space alone.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, I asked everyone to evacuate. There are only you and me here today. I have a question to ask you."</p>

    <p>I saw the sword master with his hands behind his back. His body was slightly floating in the void as usual. He turned his face slightly and looked at Wang Muyu with a kind expression.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, please speak." Wang Muyu bowed. He was very polite.</p>

    <p>"Teacher wants to ask you, who are you?"</p>
