  <h1>Chapter 2146 Couple Sealer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Bai glanced at the player ID of this sealer from his guild.</p>

    <p>ID name: Guozi</p>

    <p>He had no doubts about Guozi's words. Although he could not be familiar with every player in the guild. But since he could enter his own White Horse Guild, it showed that this person had at least passed the three hall leaders and deputy guilds in the guild. Only after layer-by-layer review by the president can you join the White Horse Guild.</p>

    <p>In addition, the place name of Fuyun Town made Li Bai feel particularly familiar.</p>

    <p>"I remember this place seems very familiar. Where have I heard it before?" Li Bai touched his chin and thought.</p>

    <p>"It must be the place where the Hundred Cave Demon Lord was killed nearby," said Mangshan, the guild president of Yamano Villager. He obviously also paid attention to Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling At level 1, he single-handedly killed the Baidong Demon Lord near Fuyun Town. This incident was announced on the World Channel. All players in the game have seen that shiny place name.</p>

    <p>A Baidong Demon Lord near Xinshou Village was directly killed by Lian Guo. This incident seemed unbelievable to many people.</p>

    <p>So old players quickly thought of two possibilities. That is, either a boring boss went to the novice map to do this. But the probability of this guess being correct is very low. Because usually players above level 30 The time cost and benefits for players to do this are completely disproportionate.</p>

    <p>For players above level 30, playing dungeons with a group every day is already exhausting.</p>

    <p>The second guess is that there may be old players who have opened a novice account nearby. They have thoroughly studied the Baidong Demon Lord and killed this Baidong Demon Lord in the novice stage.</p>

    <p>The next most likely operation is to borrow the Demon Lord Token of the Baidong Demon Lord to gain control over the monsters. Let the monsters work for you to build the town.</p>

    <p>The possibility of this guess is higher than the first one. And it has been verified so far.</p>

    <p>Because both Li Bai and Mangshan had seen the gleaming second system announcement.</p>

    <p>In the announcement, the system shows that Fuyun Town has completed the town upgrade!</p>

    <p>From killing the Hundred Cave Demon Lord to upgrading the town. That all happened in one day!</p>

    <p>So. Maybe there are really big players who open trumpets there...</p>

    <p>After passing the Hei Long Cave dungeon, Li Bai and Mangshan, who were originally a little dissatisfied with the Four Elephants, felt that they had discovered a brand new path to alliance after being reminded by this "pot" player.</p>

    <p>"Guozi. You recommended us to go there. Do you know something?" Li Bai got off his mount and patted Guozi on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Of course." The pot guy nodded repeatedly: "And I also know the profession of the person who killed the Hundred Cave Demon Lord."</p>

    <p>"What profession?"</p>

    <p>This is undisclosed information. It makes Li Bai and Mangshan very curious.</p>

    <p>They pulled the pot aside and communicated using a three-person team private chat channel.</p>

    <p>Guodu didn't hide anything. He said bluntly: "Waste wood."</p>

    <p>"What? Good-for-nothing? Did I hear you right? This profession... can also kill the Demon Lord of Hundred Cave in the novice stage?" Mangshan simply doubted his ears after hearing this.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, this is completely impossible. Because the loser is a late-stage profession. The space for manipulation is too low in the early stage. It is also one of the professions that is least recommended for novice players in the early stage.</p>

    <p>Because there are too many surprises and the attributes and abilities in all aspects are not outstanding, it is easy to die one after another in the novice stage.</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. Mangshan. Although the operation is not easy, Mangshan. But if you are a big-shot player, you may be able to perform miracles."</p>

    <p>After Li Bai heard this, although he was equally surprised, he was more calm than Mangshan.</p>

    <p>He calmly analyzed: "Being able to choose a loser to start the game means that this guy already has a considerable understanding of all major professions. If he can get high-level skills at the start, the experience will indeed be different."</p>

    <p>"Getting high-level skills at the beginning? Is it possible?"</p>

    <p>"It's impossible for other professions, but the probability of being useless is higher. The professional balance of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring is here. Hasn't anyone else evaluated it? Although the accidental probability of useless is high, it is compared to other professions. The probability of triggering hidden tasks is also higher. And..."</p>

    <p>Li Bai frowned slightly and said: "This profession can be played as a casual player. This is also a major mechanism for useless players. He can learn all professional skills."</p>

    <p>"So that's it... he's a full-time master!" Mangshan suddenly became enlightened upon hearing this.</p>

    <p>After doing this, they immediately felt how awesome the useless player from Fuyun Town was.</p>

    <p>But the fact is. Wang Ling is really the first time to play this game of Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>After learning about the situation, Li Bai and Mangshan quickly thanked Guozi.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Guozi! When you download the dungeon, you can come directly to us. We will help you upgrade."</p>

    <p>They said this.</p>

    <p>This is not a courtesy, but a promise to do what you say. The players of Li Bai and Mangshan have very good reputations. This is why Guozi takes a fancy to the two of them.</p>

    <p>"It's easy to talk about. Then, two presidents, I won't bother you. I don't have a mount. You can just go there quickly. As far as I know, there are many players who are looking for cooperation in Fuyun Town." Guozi said.</p>

    <p>"Okay! Got it!"</p>

    <p>They respond.</p>

    <p>Then after looking at each other, they took out the teleportation scroll in their arms in a tacit understanding. Throwing it into the sky, they opened the teleportation circle and planned to teleport directly to the location closest to Fuyun Town. Then they flew directly over on their mounts.</p>

    <p>They all directly used the teleportation scroll...</p>

    <p>This thing is a rare thing in the Itinerant Immortal magic ring game world. All magic weapons related to space teleportation capabilities are of high value in the game world.</p>

    <p>Whether it is a magic weapon with a limited number of uses or an unlimited number of magic weapons, a space magic weapon with unlimited use times can even sell for a sky-high price!</p>

    <p>After the two left, another Sealer player named "Lu" approached the pot: "You just let them pass?"</p>

    <p>This is a female gamer. She seems to be a couple with this pot guy. She stepped forward and fiddled with the pot guy's bangs with her fingers and said.</p>

    <p>"There is no way. Master is short of people. I have been observing for a long time before recommending these two people." Guozi sighed.</p>

    <p>Even Li Bai and Mangshan would not have thought that this player named Guozi is the famous urban hero Zhuo Yi in the real world...</p>

    <p>Guozi is his pseudonym in the game. It is very reasonable and appropriate.</p>

    <p>As for "LV", it's naturally Jiugong Liangzi. Jiugong directly took the character for palace and removed the hijab as his own game ID.</p>

    <p>"So what do you want to do next?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi chuckled. He looked at Xiong Wu who was dividing the treasure chest with the Four Elephants and others: "Tell me. What will happen if I fool the Four Elephants and others again?"</p>

    <p>"This person doesn't seem to be willing to cooperate. If we can't reach an agreement, he may directly choose to attack. Get rid of Wang Ling and Rongrong."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. You're right."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded meaningfully: "But what I want is for them to fight..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, he walked straight towards Xiongwu and began to repeat the previous operations with Li Bai and Mangshan Anli Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the guild IDs of him and Jiugong Liangzi were also directly modified simultaneously. They turned into "Members of the Four Elephants Guild"...</p>

    <p>No one can imagine. Zhuo Yi's identity with Jiugong Liangzi. Not just a gamer in the world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it is also a person with certain operating rights. gm...</p>
