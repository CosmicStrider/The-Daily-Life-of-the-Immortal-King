  <h1>Chapter 1949 Spirit World 2 Internal Tests</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A very familiar voice. Jiang Yingying's expression was obviously stunned.</p>

    <p>She was suspicious. Logically speaking, she had never met the owner of this unknown teahouse. But she didn't know why, but she felt that the voice was very familiar. It seemed like a familiar voice. And it was the kind of voice that she often heard.</p>

    <p>After entering the teahouse store, Jiang Yingying began to carefully examine the interior decoration. The old display cabinets and pure wooden mahogany tables and chairs gave off a strong sense of simplicity. It really made people feel as if this unknown teahouse had already been here. I have had this illusion for a long time.</p>

    <p>At this time, a human figure was projected on a rectangular wooden board hanging above the display cabinet. Jiang Yingying was startled. This was not an ordinary wooden board. On the surface, a simulation spell was used to assimilate an electronic LCD screen into an The look of a wooden board.</p>

    <p>"Today, your task is to visit the store and attract customers in your own way. There is a tea list under the display cabinet. The types of tea on the tea cans have been marked. The method of making tea is on the notepad at the front desk. Here, you can just understand it yourself." Taoist Guang said seriously.</p>

    <p>"Senior, I would like to ask...have we met somewhere?" Jiang Yingying stared at the mimic board for a long time.</p>

    <p>"I'm that game anchor. What's all the fuss about." Daoist Guang said calmly.</p>

    <p>"It's really you, senior..." Jiang Yingying was shocked. He didn't expect that the owner of this unknown teahouse was actually the internet celebrity game anchor.</p>

    <p>"Develop a side business. There's nothing wrong with that."</p>

    <p>Guang Daoren replied: "E-sports is a bowl of rice for youth. Many times after this age, if you can't make money, you can't live. So you should take advantage of the spare time and develop more side businesses."</p>

    <p>"But senior, you are already old..."</p>

    <p>"Look at the cultivators who have been cultivating for fifty or sixty years in the middle of the night and are galloping in the Canyon of Kings. Although I am a little bit older than them, I am still getting stronger with age."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang chuckled and said, "Wang Piaoliang is my old friend. If she hadn't strongly recommended you, I wouldn't have used this little girl like you."</p>

    <p>"Senior, don't worry. I will do it well. I also know the tea ceremony. I will definitely be able to run the business here well. It's just soliciting customers..." Jiang Yingying was ashamed. She actually didn't expect to have a job of soliciting customers.</p>

    <p>Isn't this a clear attempt to steal business from Mr. Teng?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Jiang Yingying suddenly felt in a dilemma.</p>

    <p>But just when she was struggling, Taoist Guang suddenly said: "Solicit customers. I won't force you. But after all, your salary is also linked to sales. How many customers and sales you can attract depends on your own ability." If you want to earn the guaranteed 1,000 yuan, I won't say anything to you."</p>

    <p>To be honest, these words awakened Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>In fact, 1,000 yuan a day is not enough. She lost all her wealth to buy a fancy desk this time!</p>

    <p>According to the unscrupulous update speed of the author of {The Daily Life of the Immortal King}, she earns 1,000 yuan a day from the book. It would take years and months to make back the money!</p>

    <p>And in order to carry out the investigation smoothly, the most important task now is to raise funds... and the matter of raising funds cannot be noticed by Teng Lao. If Teng Lao knows that she used six exorbitantly priced small cans of tea to replace desks and chairs. I was afraid that I would become so angry that I would develop high blood pressure on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Senior Guang. I will do my job well! I will be the sales queen from now on!" Jiang Yingying said confidently with Taoist Guang.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At night. Wang Ling was lying on the bed. Quietly watching the second hand of the wall clock in the room rotate in circles.</p>

    <p>Now he is basically sure. The so-called internal test in the spirit world is actually a test specially designed for him by Teng Lao. It is not really intended to select talents for the Earth Center Plan from the younger generation of elite cultivators.</p>

    <p>Regarding the list of the Geocentric Plan, Shangfeng should have decided it long ago. And this round of internal testing in the spiritual world is mainly aimed at themselves.</p>

    <p>Today during the day Wang Ling received news of the second internal beta test of the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>This time there were more people than last time. In addition to the new people, those who failed to complete the assessment in the last test also completed the supplementary test under the guidance of Jing Heqiu. Results Those who pass will also join the second closed beta. It's just this second time. Wang Ling didn't know what kind of method the old vine will use to test himself.</p>

    <p>Having experience from the last confrontation, Teng Luchen should be able to do it more seamlessly this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lay on the bed for a while. A series of vibrations on his phone reminded him. The chatty Li Changzhe bombarded him with text messages again.</p>

    <p>"Tomorrow is the second spirit world closed beta! Wang Ling Brothers, we are going to meet again!" He said excitedly. He sent several grinning emoticons in succession.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Helpless. Wang Ling could only reply with an ellipsis indifferently.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, he had doubts in his mind.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe has already returned to Jinghua City after completing the first internal test. So he has to come to Songhai City again for the second internal test?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was speechless. After all, he was a student from a top-ranked cultivation school. The round-trip immortal boat ticket must have cost a lot of money.</p>

    <p>How many packs of crispy noodles can I buy with just this travel fee? It's such a waste!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling The corners of his mouth twitched. His heart ached.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the screen for a long time. He did not type. He stared at the screen and watched as the [The other person is typing...] above WeChat kept dimming.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Li Changzhe sent over another large amount of text. His hand speed was astonishing: "You don't know yet? It is said to better contact students from all over the world to participate in the internal testing of the spirit world. Now the city teleportation array has been activated. Only authorized people are eligible. Foreign students participating in internal testing."</p>

    <p>City teleportation array?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised.</p>

    <p>Because under normal circumstances, mechanisms such as city teleportation arrays will not be activated easily. Teleportation arrays in major cities are usually activated only when the cultivator country enters combat readiness mode or launches a large-scale cultivator military exercise.</p>

    <p>Obviously. It is possible to directly activate the city teleportation array to provide backup protection in time and location for students who are testing in the spirit world. Such strength is impossible to achieve without ten generals and one level.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it's the result of the manipulation behind the scenes by that old man again.</p>

    <p>What medicine is this old gentleman selling in his gourd?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was suspicious.</p>

    <p>And Li Changzhe always seems to have a wealth of information. I don't know why. Wang Ling even has the feeling that the other party is intentionally sending information to me.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe said again: "By the way Wang Ling. There is another thing you may not know yet. I heard that the second spiritual world internal test will also have a system reward mechanism implanted. This means that in this spiritual world internal test, Every decision you make will be rewarded. There are high-level spell scrolls, high-quality magic weapons, and high-level elixirs!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a moment. Then he replied with the word "oh."</p>

    <p>To him, as long as there are no high-quality crispy noodles, these prizes are all garbage...</p>
