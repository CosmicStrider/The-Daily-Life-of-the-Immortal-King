  <h1>Chapter 1700 How to prove that you are not parasitized</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Ma's inference is completely logical. When the infected person is already around, we have to guard against it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling closed his eyes and used his retrieval ability to communicate with the "Book of Sage Immortal" remotely. Although the Book of Sage Immortal had already been sent out of this universe, it was still occasionally used as a remote search engine by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After sending it out, the noisy voice of the Book of Sage Immortal did reduce a lot, and it was also much more convenient for Wang Ling to check the Book of Sage Immortal, because of the remote will communication, this annoying ipad will not be that Jumping in the face, and it will only give him the answer he wants.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling feels that this may also be a sign of weakness from the Book of Sage Immortal. It is probably to make up for it or something.</p>

    <p>"Thinking Plague."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly chewed on the name he got from the "Book of Sage Immortal."</p>

    <p>This is one of the dirtiest characters in Old Dominator. It controls silently by invading the mind. Not just human cultivators. Any creature with life and soul will be controlled by the other party.</p>

    <p>And, most importantly.</p>

    <p>Those with the thought plague will constantly change the bodies they have invaded so as to leave no traces.</p>

    <p>And the final outcome of those discarded bodies will be clearly arranged, disguised as various suicides or accidental deaths. In this way, there is no way to investigate.</p>

    <p>But no matter what, the seriousness of this matter is enough to attract Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>Because according to the currently known data, people with the Thought Plague are extremely contagious, especially after replacing their bodies. Even though those used bodies will become dead bodies, they can also become new sources of infection.</p>

    <p>This means that they will leave their own "seeds" in the corpse, allowing those who come into contact with the seeds to become new infections.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if this matter is not taken seriously, it may spread among human cultivators on a large scale.</p>

    <p>As the Old Dominator in the universe for eternity, with the current cultivation methods on earth, there is currently no way to identify the true identity of this kind of creature. Once parasitized, it means that it will be 100% controlled.</p>

    <p>So for the problem before Wang Ling now, we must first investigate three points.</p>

    <p>The first is the source of the thought plague.</p>

    <p>The second is who assigned these thought plaguers.</p>

    <p>And the third thing is who of the people around you are infected and how to prevent it.</p>

    <p>"That's the basic situation Master said."</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi summarized the message given by Wang Ling, he verbally relayed the incident to other people here in a simple and clear way.</p>

    <p>Now as an apprentice, he is not only used to "take the blame", but also used for various other purposes.</p>

    <p>When he said this, his mind was filled with a scene from a movie, where Wang Ling appeared in front of him dressed like a gangster in the dark and rainy street, asking him: "What is the surprise you mean by translating<sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Scene from a Chinese Comedy/Western "让子弹飞" "Let the Bullets Fly")</dfn>

    <p>"In other words, we need to prove our innocence now?" Lord Ma said.</p>

    <p>"Lord Ma, you don't have to. After all, you are the magic spirit. Master can tell it at a glance. As for the others, no one can escape." Zhuo Yi curled his lips and smiled: "Let's do it. One Come one. Let's ask each other questions. Prove innocence."</p>

    <p>There are no outsiders here. Except Zhuo Yi, it is Sun Rong and Er Ha.</p>

    <p>The operation of self-proving innocence is not what Wang Ling thinks of. It is Zhuo Yi who has his own ideas...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't stop it. Instead, it was like watching a show.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi said these words, he saw Sun Rong's face turned red, as if it would burn up at any time.</p>

    <p>"Well, let me start. You ask me first." Zhuo Yi looked at Er Ha and asked.</p>

    <p>Er Ha responded quickly: "Do you prefer plateau or flat land?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Flat ground."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Then what is your favorite thing to eat? Bone sticks and big meat flies."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Of course it's a bone stick filled with big meat flies!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Very good! Proof complete!"</p>

    <p>One person and one dog cooperated tacitly. After asking each other questions, they gave each other a high-five.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "This...is this enough?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded: "Of course. Then would Miss Rong want to come and give it a try?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Just try it..."</p>

    <p>She thought she might ask some tricky questions, so she was worried. But the question just now didn't seem to be anything special.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi looked at her and suddenly asked: "If a boy who is prettier than Master appears in front of you, will you fall in love with him?"</p>

    <p>This question surprised Sun Rong. But she still shook her head firmly: "Of course not."</p>

    <p>She had always been convinced in her heart.</p>

    <p>The reason why I like Wang Ling is not because I like Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>There are so many good-looking young men. As the eldest daughter of the Sun family, she can call out so many of them and leave them at once. But only Wang Ling is special to her.</p>

    <p>Upon hearing the answer, Zhuo Yi looked like he had succeeded in his conspiracy. He quickly asked: "Why? Is it because you like my master?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knew it was bad as soon as he heard it. I was tricked by Zhuo Yi again!</p>

    <p>This bad guy...knows his tricks all day long.</p>

    <p>He even asked questions!</p>

    <p>And forget about asking. I still ask this kind of question...and in front of Wang Ling. How should she answer it!</p>

    <p>She struggled internally, then gritted her teeth and rejected it with all her strength: "Of course...of course not!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked when he heard this: "No? It turns out you are a fake Miss Rong. Brother Ha, let's go!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was instantly panicked. He looked at Zhuo Yi with an expression of resignation: "Yes...yes...I like Wang Ling! Isn't that okay?"</p>

    <p>She looked unhappy. The shame of being forced to confess her love in front of Wang Ling made her just want to find a hole to crawl into.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling heard this, his expression didn't change much.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Sun Rong has confessed her love a few times before, so she is probably a bit used to it.</p>

    <p>He knows that Zhuo Yi loves to cause trouble so much. It is actually an act of assisting.</p>

    <p>But there is one thing to say. Wang Ling feels that this is a useless effort.</p>

    <p>Because he won't like Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It is said that there is no pure friendship between men and women. Wang Ling feels that this is not correct at all.</p>

    <p>He felt that he and Sun Rong had this kind of pure friendship.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>It's just friendship.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head and looked at Lord Ma aside. He seemed to be conveying something.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma immediately understood. He immediately turned to Sun Rong and bowed respectfully and said, "Then, please, Miss Rong, follow me on the road."</p>

    <p>"Where to go?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma: "Of course it is to upgrade Aohai. The Lord has made an appointment with Senior Jin Deng. Miss Rong only needs to bring Aohai there with me. After it is upgraded to a nine-core spirit sword, Miss Rong will have it." You must be able to protect yourself. There is no need to worry about being threatened by the thought plague. Under the protection of such sword energy, it is difficult for them to invade Miss Rong."</p>
