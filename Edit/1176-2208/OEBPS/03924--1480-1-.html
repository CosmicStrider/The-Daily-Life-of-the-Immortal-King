  <h1>Chapter 1480 The worst decision in Zhuo Yi's life</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This roar shocked countless eyes on Jiugong Liangzi on the ancient street.</p>

    <p>The roaring girl was so angry that her chest was bullied. Although she didn't have breasts that could rise and fall...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi I have never seen Jiugong Liangzi look so angry. This must be a roar with all his strength. Perhaps in Jiugong Liangzi's view, the lethality of this roar is like a "battlefield roar" Shocking.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi is not afraid at all. Liangzi is so cute. He even likes the way he roars.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi caught up. This was Zhuo Yi's miscalculation.</p>

    <p>He was too focused on solving the problem of helping his master to rescue him and guiding his wife to meet with his master. Due to his negligence, he was not even aware that he was being followed.</p>

    <p>Although he was not afraid of the girl's yelling, when Zhuo Yi saw the tears in the corners of Jiugong Liangzi's eyes from a distance, his expression instantly became serious.</p>

    <p>It looks like the problem is a bit serious.</p>

    <p>This little girl is really angry...</p>

    <p>With a silent sigh in his heart, Jiugong Liangzi turned around and ran in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Seeing this, he rushed forward and chased forward.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong!" he shouted as he ran. It was not because he was afraid of anything else, but because he was worried that the girl would bump and hurt herself while running hurriedly in the crowd.</p>

    <p>In the process of chasing the girl. I don't know why Zhuo Yi's mind suddenly felt like a movie and TV drama routine...</p>

    <p>It seems that in many youth blockbusters, there is such a chase scene.</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhuo Yi didn't expect that his youth has expired. Now he has to chase a girl in front of so many people.</p>

    <p>So... for the next 20 minutes...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi chased Jiugong Liangzi while running. He could catch up with Jiugong Liangzi, but he was afraid that he would chase too hard and injure the girl.</p>

    <p>After chasing for eight streets, from Second Street to Tenth Street, the girl in front stopped.</p>

    <p>Because Jiugong Liangzi suddenly realized a problem.</p>

    <p>That is, when Zhuo Yi's level is higher than his own. There is still a huge gap in physical fitness between them.</p>

    <p>In other words, if she keeps running, she will run out of energy... and Zhuo Yi. will catch up to her sooner or later.</p>

    <p>God knows if this old liar will do anything strange when his physical strength is damaged!</p>

    <p>In fact, after running for so long, Jiugong Liangzi's mood has calmed down a lot.</p>

    <p>Because essentially, the relationship between her and Zhuo Yi is just an employment relationship.</p>

    <p>Even if this old liar has a messy private life. What does it have to do with him...</p>

    <p>As an employer, the most she can do is morally condemn such behavior.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, aren't you going to run away?" Zhuo Yi asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>We chased him all the way to the 10th Street. There were obviously fewer people nearby.</p>

    <p>The closest witness to them was a fruit stall owner who was eating watermelon.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Zhuo Yi never expected that a girl with such a flat chest could run so fast... From a fluid mechanics point of view, the streamlines of a flat chest are not very good, so the air resistance will be increased.</p>

    <p>But then I thought about it. Zhuo Yi understood it instantly.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because it's too flat and the quality is reduced...</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, Zhuo Yi would definitely use it as a joke to show off his cleverness. But now is obviously not the time.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of him seemed less angry. However, Zhuo Yi still felt a "hateful look" from Jiugong Liangzi. Just like when the girl came to the principal's office to question him a few days ago.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hugged her arms, her voice resumed into that kind of icy cold Missy feeling: "Sun schoolmates, Jiang schoolmates... how many other schoolmates do you have in the end?"</p>

    <p>After listening to Zhuo Yi, I actually felt like laughing.</p>

    <p>Just because the vinegar smell is really too strong.</p>

    <p>But the girl in front of her seemed to be unconscious.</p>

    <p>Hey. Why does this girl please him so much...</p>

    <p>"I think classmate Jiugong must have misunderstood something." Zhuo Yi said: "I did it because I wanted to go to the toilet.</p>

    <p>It's true that I went to see Sun Rong's school girl. But at that time, Sun Rong's school girl was squeezed in among the couples. She seemed very troubled. So she asked me to do a little favor. Take her out. Everyone around me was worried. They were kissing. Girls are thin-skinned and embarrassed to disturb them. "Is this also to return a favor? For the election?" Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>

    <p>"It's true that I'm returning a favor. But it's actually classmate Jiugong's favor that I'm returning." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>As an excellent planner, since he knew that the relationship between his wife and Jiugong Liangzi was not harmonious, of course he was also looking for ways to harmonize the two.</p>

    <p>In fact, just as he was running, Zhuo Yi did come up with a clever idea.</p>

    <p>"I owe her a favor? Are you kidding me..." Jiugong Liangzi showed an expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>"Awei's three people's room, including the witness protection plan. In fact, I asked Sun Rong's school girl to use her family's power to do it." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>This explanation is of course different from the actual situation. But actually, there is nothing wrong with it if you think about it carefully.</p>

    <p>This hotel is originally a property of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. So the implementation of the witness protection plan is inseparable from the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>This is an impeccable reason. Even if Jiugong Liangzi investigates later, the conclusion will be the same.</p>

    <p>While chasing the girl, Zhuo Yi had edited a text message to Sun Rong. He had made preparations for collusion in advance to prevent the secret from being exposed...</p>

    <p>Although he was doubtful about this answer, Jiugong Liangzi felt that he felt a lot more comfortable: "Huh! Did I say I wanted her help?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at her firmly and said: "So I will do everything for you. I have been begging her for a long time... for you."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's face turned red when he was told: "Humph! You have no spine!"</p>

    <p>"What I said, you can investigate afterwards. Are you satisfied now? It's getting late. Go back and rest early." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute! You haven't told me about another school girl! Who is that Jiang Yingying..."</p>

    <p>"So is there something that Jiugong-san doesn't know?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "According to the clues I just got, classmate Jiang Yingying was kidnapped. But in fact, this group of people came for Sun Rong's school girl..."</p>

    <p>"Can this be tied wrongly?"</p>

    <p>"At first glance, classmate Jiang Yingying and Sun Rong's classmate do look a little similar. Now Sun Rong's classmate is using family power to negotiate with the kidnappers." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He found that the term "family power" is really useful. It can perfectly explain many things.</p>

    <p>"So that's what it is..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi frowned. He seemed concerned: "What about Sun Rong?"</p>

    <p>"Are you... worried?"</p>

    <p>"Who should worry about her! I just... want to return the favor!"</p>

    <p>Now that everything has been said, Jiugong Liangzi's mood has returned to its original state.</p>

    <p>She snorted like a proud black swan and walked towards the hotel: "Then go back. As an employer, I will give you special permission tonight to pay more attention to the kidnapper."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Zhuo Yi held back a laugh.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, he glanced at the fruit stall on the roadside: "Would you like to buy some fruit and go home?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glanced at the fruits on the fruit stall. He said without interest: "You have made your decision."</p>

    <p>She actually has an idea in mind.</p>

    <p>Mainly I want to see if the fruits that Zhuo Yi likes to eat are the same as mine.</p>

    <p>"Then let's have durian."</p>

    <p>I saw Zhuo Yi holding his chin, thinking seriously for a moment, and then said.</p>

    <p>He didn't know that this might be the worst decision he ever made in his life...</p>
