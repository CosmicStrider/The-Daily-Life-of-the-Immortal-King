  <h1>Chapter 1804 The crazy night of taking the blame</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This choice was not Pei Luoqi's whim, but the result of careful consideration.</p>

    <p>The death of the Arch Pope was an accident that no one expected. But if he were to bear this thunder at this time, once the relationship between the Heavenly Dao Alliance and the Church was exposed, it would inevitably cause chaos in the checks and balances of the other forces.</p>

    <p>The work of their Heavenly Dao Alliance was originally to adjust the edge of the various forces, so that all forces could form a relatively stable situation under the control of the church.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he must not be able to withstand this thunder. The remaining choice is to choose between the three of Maiko Assi, Mrs. Lawen and Levis.</p>

    <p>Currently, Mrs. Lawen is preparing for the variety show challenge. In order to carry out the plan in an orderly manner, there is no way he will let Lawen take this thunder and disrupt the inherent rhythm.</p>

    <p>As for the Chilan Society led by Levis, it already had conflicts with Maiko Assi. His mediation this time was originally to mediate the conflict between Maiko Assi and Levis. If Levis is allowed to block the gun again at this time. This is contrary to Pei Luoqi's original purpose.</p>

    <p>So right now, the only way to go is Maiko Assi...</p>

    <p>Moreover, with Maiko Assi's status and legendary reputation in the Mixiu Country, even if it was finally reported that the Arch Pope died at the hands of Maiko Assi, the government actually had nothing to do with this legendary general.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi thought that in the end, Maiko Assi could only suffer the loss of silence.</p>

    <p>"My dear, can we really survive this..." Pei Luoqi's wife's voice was still trembling. Her heart was filled with regret. She never expected that their happy little family would end up in this situation.</p>

    <p>"Now you just need to clean up the house as I told you... leave all the rest to me..." Pei Luoqi said. He hugged his wife and son tightly in his arms. At the same time, his mind Zhong also began to think about a comprehensive plan to dump the blame.</p>

    <p>First. He wants to save the body of the Arch Pope...</p>

    <p>At the very least, it is necessary to delay the death of the Arch Pope and allow the blood circulation in his body to continue flowing for a period of time, creating the illusion that he is still alive.</p>

    <p>Such a method is of course impossible to achieve under normal circumstances. But for high-level cultivators, it is not difficult.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, on the cliff of Aofeng Mountain in Glio City, the legendary general of Mixiu Country, Maiko Assi, was sitting cross-legged here. His consciousness was connected to the sky, and he was talking to his friends across a long distance.</p>

    <p>Such a stream of consciousness conversation will not be disturbed by outsiders, nor will it be recorded. It is a very safe means of conversation.</p>

    <p>"I really don't know what the Arch Pope is thinking. Mafia organizations like the Chilan Society are simply unreliable! I, Maiko Assi, have never been so angry. If he hadn't been the Arch Pope, I wouldn't even know him. I'll get rid of him too!" Maiko Assi communicated with his consciousness.</p>

    <p>From the opposite side, there was a burst of slightly old laughter.</p>

    <p>The people who were talking to Maiko Assi at this time were the other two legendary generals of Mixiu Country. Navy Admiral Mengchi and Air Force General Liakong.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Admiral Mengchi laughed quickly and said, "Maiko, you don't know this. The Chilan Society has been able to show off in places like Glio City for so many years. There is naturally some connection with the church behind it. You can just talk about it. After all, the status of the Arch Pope is extraordinary..."</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi sighed: "Just because he is Yuan Zun's uncle, he can do whatever he wants?"</p>

    <p>Air Force General Liakong also laughed: "It's the uncle. Of course you can do whatever you want. But Maiko Assi, you have to be more careful. You can't talk nonsense about killing the Arch Pope. If it messes up the relationship between you Yuan Zun in the future, it will be more loss than gain."</p>

    <p>"I know. But after this, I must make Levi's regret it." Maiko Assi said sinisterly.</p>

    <p>Just as Meng Chi and Liakong said, because of the interference between the church and the Heavenly Dao Alliance, his original plan to destroy the Chilan Society could only be abandoned this time.</p>

    <p>But as a proud man, Maiko Assi has always been full of hostility towards those who disrespect him.</p>

    <p>This time he can temporarily let Levi go for the sake of the church. But after everything is over, Maiko Assi has decided. He will launch a new system against Maiko Assi as the legendary general of Mixiu Country.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mixiu Country West Wind Castle in Glio City. This is one of Mixiu's properties in Glio City. He will choose to stay here every time he comes to Glio City.</p>

    <p>After talking with the other two generals, he felt that he felt much better. Then he immediately returned to Xifeng Castle.</p>

    <p>His youngest daughter Maiko Abei is still going to school in Glio City. She also lives in the castle on weekdays.</p>

    <p>For an old father, when he is extremely depressed, being able to see his daughter by his side may be the greatest comfort.</p>

    <p>When the gate to the forecourt of the castle opened, Maiko Assi held the general's sword in his hand and walked into the front yard in a swaggering manner.</p>

    <p>"Where is Xiaobei now?" he asked.</p>

    <p>The maid sweeping the floor bowed respectfully: "The young lady is playing in the manor behind now. The head maid is guarding her."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Maiko Assi nodded.</p>

    <p>After the servants in Xiang Xifeng Castle learned about his daughter's location, Maiko Assi made a hissing gesture and planned to approach secretly from the alley.</p>

    <p>However, as they approached the back manor, a strange murderous aura suddenly penetrated from under the shade of a tree.</p>

    <p>An assassin?</p>

    <p>The general's residence. Attacks by assassins occasionally occur.</p>

    <p>Of course, Maiko Assi knew that this was not for him, but for his daughter. As long as he kidnapped his daughter, he had the qualifications and rights to blackmail him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Maiko Assi was not around, he found a powerful maid to serve around Maiko Abei at all times. She was responsible for protecting the safety of Maiko Abei.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after feeling the murderous aura, Maiko Assi's first reaction was the assassin ambushing behind the tree. He wanted to take advantage of Maiko Assi's way back to his disadvantage.</p>

    <p>Little thing, you are so unlucky. You happened to run into me...</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi sneered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't hesitate at all. He drew his sword directly and aimed it at the tree trunk to pierce it.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>A large amount of blood spurted out from behind the tree trunk and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>After Maiko Assi withdrew his sword, the assassin hiding behind the tree trunk fell into a pool of blood with a pop.</p>

    <p>Walking around to the front of the tree with an expressionless face, Maiko Assi turned the assassin over with his feet. When he saw the assassin's face, Maiko Assi's whole face changed instantly...</p>

    <p>Arch Pope!?</p>

    <p>The Arch Pope... how could he appear here...</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi was shocked.</p>

    <p>He had just told the other two generals that he was dissatisfied with the Arch Pope's decision. He also kept saying that he would kill the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>As a result, the Arch Pope really died under his sword...</p>

    <p>If Lord Yuan Zun knew about this, he would definitely be miserable!</p>

    <p>For a moment, Maiko Assi broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why the Arch Pope appeared here... But judging from the current situation, the Arch Pope was killed by him! The marks on his general's sword were very special. He could never deceive anyone!</p>

    <p>"There is no other way..." At this time, Maiko Assi's thoughts were flowing. He was trying his best to think of how to separate himself from the relationship with the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>Then he thought of a very suitable candidate to take the blame...</p>

    <p>Levi's...</p>
