  <h1>Chapter 1383 Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube Secret Room</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sinkhole is very deep. Sun Rong used sword energy to test it.</p>

    <p>The vertical distance from here to the deepest point at the bottom is at least 20,000 meters.</p>

    <p>While falling, she saw a few Shenlong clan members clinging to the protruding rock wall and lying on the steep rock wall.</p>

    <p>These are the people who fell into the sinkhole at the moment it was formed.</p>

    <p>And it's pretty lucky.</p>

    <p>They caught the rock protrusion of the stone wall and saved their lives.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid more people will fall directly into the ground.</p>

    <p>"Aohai!"Sun Rong couldn't bear it. Calling Aohai.</p>

    <p>She used Aohai's sword energy to form a gentle sword flow, and sent back to the ground one by one the desperate Shenlong clan members she saw lying on the stone wall.</p>

    <p>"The number of people who were directly thrown to death is probably in the tens of thousands." Er Ha only made a rough impression.</p>

    <p>In such a large and deep sinkhole, there are countless souls floating nearby. It can feel it with incomparable clarity.</p>

    <p>As a professional who relies on devouring souls all year round to strengthen himself, in terms of soul sensing ability, not counting Wang Ling, almost no one can match him.</p>

    <p>"I will deal with these Shenlong tribesmen who died in vain. I will deal with them properly later. Rongrong, don't worry!" Ajuan sighed.</p>

    <p>This is an unnecessary disaster. No one wants to see such a result.</p>

    <p>"Will he be resurrected?"</p>

    <p>"This can be a choice based on their own wishes." Ajuan said: "Reincarnation and resurrection are both paths. But I think most of the Shenlong clan members who die unexpectedly will choose reincarnation."</p>

    <p>"If you can live here in the heart of the city, you should be a noble, right?"</p>

    <p>"This is a matter of cultural beliefs. The Shenlong people have always believed that life can become better in the next life after reincarnation." Ajuan replied.</p>

    <p>About two minutes passed. Sun Rong suddenly felt that something was wrong: "Ajuan. I have measured the depth of this sinkhole with sword energy. It stands to reason that we are close to the ground. But why are we still falling? ?"</p>

    <p>Things are different!</p>

    <p>Ajuan also found it strange. A string of rosary beads on her wrist was glowing. They were beads polished from the bones of the Old God. The beads were crystal clear and exuded powerful divinity.</p>

    <p>She detached one of them from it, and then suddenly ejected it deep into the ground.</p>

    <p>Powerful divine energy pours in like a spiritual sea, illuminating the abyss below with an unstoppable force.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by countless divine feathers floating down with shining light.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that their falling speed suddenly slowed down a lot. There was a force entrenched at the feet of the divine rabbit, gently lifting them all up.</p>

    <p>This is a divine cloud made from Old God rosary beads.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"Sun Rong was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Have you not noticed yet? We have entered the realm of Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. In other words, we are now in the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube." Er Ha said patiently, with a calm tone.</p>

    <p>After all, considering that this is the first time for a girl to go on a mission, it is normal for her to have a lack of experience when facing various emergencies.</p>

    <p>When practicing, you need to be able to ask questions without being ashamed.</p>

    <p>This is the same as learning.</p>

    <p>But if you think the author's writing is short, it's useless to urge you to update it, because it may be really short.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's reminder can be said to wake up a dreamer.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held Aohai. He used Aohai to perceive the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube again. However, he found that Aohai's sword energy no longer showed the same downward trend as it did at the beginning. Instead, it spread out in all directions.</p>

    <p>This exactly supports what Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>They are in the "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube!"</p>

    <p>Above the divine cloud, everyone stood here and stared around. It was pitch black nearby. The only light source was the luminous divine feathers floating down.</p>

    <p>Now, the divine feather has become an excellent lighting object.</p>

    <p>"Fortunately, I have more wings!" This situation actually made Ajuan feel a little proud.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"I remember the monk told me that when they destroyed the Unspeakable Land, the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube was a very small piece. It was easy to recover. What is happening now?" But the scene in front of him also made Ajuan Puzzled.</p>

    <p>"At that time, the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube was not missing. There were still nine complete pieces. Naturally, there was no riot due to mutual checks and balances. But now, when the checks and balances are lost, there is a chance that the other Rubik's Cubes will go berserk at any time."</p>

    <p>Er Ha guessed: "If my guess is right. This is what Little Master Ling said. The Heavenly Dao secret room."</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren said?"</p>

    <p>"Before I came here, he gave me a brief introduction to the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. After all, he had to make a new Rubik's Cube. Little Master Ling was also understanding the structure of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. Now we are swallowed by the Rubik's Cube. It's like being trapped in a secret room."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. There are 26 secret rooms in total. The 26 secret rooms are connected in series. But only one of them has a real exit. eh... These are what Little Master Ling told me."</p>

    <p>After all, this mission is carrying a new member who is going on a mission for the first time.</p>

    <p>Before leaving. Wang Ling simply and rudely threw all his research notes on the Rubik's Cube to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't dare to slack off. He wrote down everything he saw.</p>

    <p>As Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>This mission is indeed risky.</p>

    <p>And understanding the Rubik's Cube is also to ensure that the task is foolproof.</p>

    <p>Also in that research notebook. In addition to the information about Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>It also comes with a request from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although his Little Master Ling doesn't talk often, it is indeed the first time that he can write down so many notes for this mission...</p>

    <p>Er Ha turned his head slightly. He stared at the face of the girl hugging him through the light of Shenyu.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is nervous.</p>

    <p>It can be clearly noticed.</p>

    <p>And the start of the mission is indeed not good for them.</p>

    <p>But now that it has fully understood the structure of the Rubik's Cube, Er Ha is confident that under his own hint, he can finally escape from the secret room of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and recover the second Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>"Three elements to escape a secret room: door, clues, and key."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said concisely and concisely: "Since the Heavenly Dao star is a token of love given to Old God by Dao Ancestor Wang, the secret room element must also be related to the story of the two."</p>

    <p>"This is the abyss. What does the abyss represent?"</p>

    <p>"The abyss usually indicates danger. Does that represent the relationship between Dao Ancestor Wang and Old God. It is very difficult?" Sun Rong guessed.</p>

    <p>"That's not necessarily true." Sun Ying'er shook his head: "It may also refer to the Old God's abyssal mouth?"</p>

    <p>"The abyss...a huge mouth?"Sun Rong was startled.</p>

    <p>Immediately, she seemed to think of something embarrassing. Two balls of steam turned into long dragons and spurted out from her ears.</p>

    <p>"Na na. Has she always been like this..."</p>

    <p>Ajuan's face twitched, what kind of talk is this! !</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held up her forehead: "I'm sorry Ajuan."</p>

    <p>Ajuan: "Nah! As expected of Rongrong's shadow, it's true that she's the exact opposite of you..."</p>

    <p>Regarding Sun Ying'er's dirty talk. Sun Rong is also very helpless.</p>

    <p>But I have to say. Sun Ying'er's words actually gave Sun Rong some hints.</p>

    <p>Since we want to crack the secret room, finding the door is the most important thing.</p>

    <p>But now, since they can't see the door, maybe the door is hidden.</p>

    <p>"I know!" thought of this. Sun Rong pulled out Aohai directly.</p>

    <p>She grasped the hilt of the sword and suddenly threw it towards the bottomless abyss below.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Aohai turned into a spear-like existence. The talisman light loomed on his body. It was powerful and frightening.</p>

    <p>Then all we heard was a sound like breaking glass right below the abyss.</p>

    <p>There was a hidden forbidden barrier there. It was pierced by Aohai!</p>
