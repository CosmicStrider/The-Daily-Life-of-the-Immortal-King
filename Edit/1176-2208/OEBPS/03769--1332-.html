  <h1>Chapter 1332 Original Heavenly DaoÂ·Evil Golden Men</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stood on the edge of the golden shoreline of the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>Perceive this cosmic floating island buried deep in the eastern part of the extraterrestrial galaxy built by Dao Ancestor Wang using the supreme law.</p>

    <p>I can only say that Dao Ancestor Wang deserves to be called Dao Ancestor Wang. This kind of law building Wang Ling has never been seen before.</p>

    <p>It is equivalent to creating a huge core world outside.</p>

    <p>There are many things built using laws.</p>

    <p>Take True Immortal as an example. The inherent spiritual realm is constructed by laws.</p>

    <p>Most True Immortals can do it if they want to.</p>

    <p>Because the scope of the inherent spiritual realm is not particularly large.</p>

    <p>And if the rules were more complicated.</p>

    <p>That is the "Core World."</p>

    <p>That is, in the traditional sense, an upgraded version of the "inherent spiritual realm."</p>

    <p>Both the composition and scale of the laws far exceed the inherent spiritual realm.</p>

    <p>True Immortal realm. Only a handful of people can open up the core world in the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>As for moving the core world out of the body, that is an unimaginable operation.</p>

    <p>The unspeakable place created by Dao Ancestor Wang. At the very least, it is a core world size of 100 million True Immortals...</p>

    <p>Not only did he build such a huge core world outside, he was also able to maintain the stable shape of the world here for a long time without collapsing.</p>

    <p>This is truly unimaginable and unparalleled power.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had learned a lot during this observation.</p>

    <p>The world is so big. For Wang Ling, going out and seeing more is also growth.</p>

    <p>But now, there is nothing left to see in the Unspeakable Land for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because. He has already finished reading it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling slowly raised his hand.</p>

    <p>This action seemed familiar to the monk: "Zhenren is this?"</p>

    <p>"Empty."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's answer. Concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren doesn't plan to go in and take a look?" The monk was shocked.</p>

    <p>"I'm done reading."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The monk was speechless.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. This may be the difference between "a top student" and a "scumbag."</p>

    <p>Same question. A top student will know the answer just by glancing at the question.</p>

    <p>He, a scumbag, had to study deeply and analyze the question types before he could solve it.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he is indeed Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>This moment.</p>

    <p>The monk once again felt the deep gap between himself and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This kind of gap is no longer enough to be described with: "Ling Zhenren is awesome (broken sound)."</p>

    <p>It should be said: "Ling Zhenren! God forever!"</p>

    <p>Seeing the monk's expression of curiosity written on his face, Wang Ling finally put down his raised hand first.</p>

    <p>Although destroying the Unspeakable Land was their ultimate plan when they came here.</p>

    <p>But when the victory is certain, it doesn't matter if it is destroyed later. Since the monk wants to take another look, Wang Ling naturally has to take care of the monk's thoughts.</p>

    <p>After all, he will still have a use for the monk in the future.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the war situation on Earth. Although Sun Ying'er is coming fiercely, Wang Ling feels that the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception are not at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>It would be too boring if he destroyed the Unspeakable Land and joined the battle now.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was a battle that could be resolved in just a few seconds.</p>

    <p>"Thank you Ling Zhenren for making it happen!" Jin Deng was very grateful.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling responded lightly. He didn't pay much attention.</p>

    <p>Since the monk wants to see it, of course he will fulfill the monk's wish.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also devoted 50% of his energy to peeking at the battle taking place on the earth.</p>

    <p>Over there.</p>

    <p>A fight has already begun.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, deep in the Unspeakable Land, an evil Golden Men with three heads and six arms woke up.</p>

    <p>In the reduced state, it is still ten meters high.</p>

    <p>This huge evil Golden Men is the island owner of the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>Nickname: Original Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Of course, this nickname was not given by Dao Ancestor Wang. It was given by him himself.</p>

    <p>"I feel. There is a very strong aura..."</p>

    <p>The evil Golden Men open their eyes.</p>

    <p>The three marks engraved with ancient characters at the center of the eyebrows are slightly glowing at this time. Translated in modern terms, this actually means "zero zero one."</p>

    <p>That's right. This giant evil Golden Men...</p>

    <p>It is the earliest Heavenly Dao born in the entire unspeakable land!</p>

    <p>That is, the first Heavenly Dao developed after Dao Ancestor Wang created Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Although in the end. "Zero Zero One" was not enabled.</p>

    <p>He was forever sealed in the Unspeakable Land by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>But for the entire history of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Number 001 undoubtedly holds a pivotal position.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang sealed all the defective Heavenly Dao products he developed behind the "Unspeakable Place."</p>

    <p>Zero-One thus renamed itself "Original Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>Became the boss of an unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>Become the island owner here.</p>

    <p>"Island owner, someone has landed on the island. It's a monk and a young man..." The evil little Golden Men on the side came forward and asked.</p>

    <p>Numbers were also engraved with ancient characters on their foreheads. However, these numbers were very large. Some were three digits, some were four digits... and even six digits and seven digits.</p>

    <p>Rumor. Heavenly Dao now.</p>

    <p>It was Dao Ancestor Wang who carefully selected 30,000 results from tens of millions of test products!</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang evenly distributes thirty thousand Heavenly Dao across ten universes.</p>

    <p>He also divided the three thousand Heavenly Dao and placed restrictions on their union so that the three thousand Heavenly Dao in the ten universes could check and balance each other.</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao turned his attention to the edge of the island.</p>

    <p>He saw the figure of the monk and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"I recognize this monk..."</p>

    <p>As for the origin of Jin Deng, the original Heavenly Dao actually also heard about it.</p>

    <p>He smiled coldly: "I remember that a long time ago, this monk has always wanted to enter here. But despite Dao Ancestor's restriction, he has never been able to break through. I didn't expect that in this cycle of time, this monk would one day succeed."</p>

    <p>The reason why the original Heavenly Dao was mainly awakened. Most of them originated from the monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>That's right. He only felt the monk's breath. Then he woke up.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"Who is this young man? His disciple?" The original Heavenly Dao has never seen Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Island Master. What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"This monk is difficult to deal with. No matter how many people you send over, it will probably be useless."</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao yawned: "I think it's up to me to do it myself... This unspeakable place is not a place where people can come and leave whenever they want..."</p>

    <p>Just a monk. Plus the monk's disciples.</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao didn't even pay attention to the two people who broke into the unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>He has dominated here for too long.</p>

    <p>As the longest-living Heavenly Dao Golden Men among all the Heavenly Dao, the original Heavenly Dao had strong confidence in their own power.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was sealed in an unspeakable place for too long.</p>

    <p>In fact, our understanding of all information from the outside world is very limited.</p>

    <p>Those evil Golden Men released from the cracks. Although there are cases where they come and go, the round trip time takes a long, long time...</p>

    <p>Previously, there were also evil Golden Men on Earth who wanted to report the situation about Wang Ling to the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. Those evil Golden Men. were cleared by Wang Ling with one click.</p>

    <p>Don't know Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Probably this original Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>The biggest regret in my life...</p>
