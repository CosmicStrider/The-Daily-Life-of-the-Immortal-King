  <h1>Chapter 1577 The tacit understanding between brother and sister â‘ </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment one percent of Fenmu Shen's soul collapsed under Father Wang's "Wooden Messy Fist Dying Sensei's Punch", the damage was sent back to Fenmu Shen's original body. The damage from the backlash was sent back to Fenmu Shen's original body.</p>

    <p>He never expected that the one percent soul he had scattered on the earth would be defeated...</p>

    <p>This result was somewhat difficult for him to accept.</p>

    <p>In fact, not to mention him, even the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.</p>

    <p>It turns out that it was just when Father Wang decided to stand up like a man and accept the duel with One Percent Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya broadcast the entire battle scene live to a group group of core members within the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of many core members of the Office of Strategic Deception such as Lord Diulei. For a long time, the seniors in the Wang family's small villa lived modestly, living an ordinary life, staying at home with the air conditioner blowing, connected to wifi, and experiencing the sufferings of the world...</p>

    <p>In their inherent impression, they have never seen Father Wang take action.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Immortal Toya's live broadcast completely broke everyone's memory. What followed was cheers from the entire Office of Strategic Deception core member group!</p>

    <p>"This... Is this Senior Wang! Senior Wang is so strong! I've never seen him fight before. I thought he was just an ordinary person." Lord Lightning Dharma's gaze was horified.</p>

    <p>He thought of how he wanted to test Father Wang when he visited the Wang family's villa several times before.</p>

    <p>In the end, I didn't dare to take action because I was too timid.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was extremely grateful for the fact that he was "frightened" at that time...</p>

    <p>It's a good thing I didn't take action.</p>

    <p>If he did this... would he still be alive today?</p>

    <p>"This is why you don't understand, Father Wang. The seniors in the Wang family are not ordinary people. I have thought so since a long time ago." Lord Diulei showed eyes of wonder and approval. At the same time, he also deeply admired Father Wang.</p>

    <p>If you don't take action, that's it. Once you take action, it will be shocking...</p>

    <p>He is indeed the father of your brother and Ah Nuan girl!</p>

    <p>The man who gave birth to two space-level monsters one after another!</p>

    <p>In a sense. Lord Diulei feels that Father Wang and Mother Wang are the strongest...</p>

    <p>In comparison, he would actually rather believe that Father Wang, Mother Wang and Mr. Wang are very powerful people.</p>

    <p>If these three are all mortals... then the birth of Wang Ling and Wang Nuan is probably an unsolved mystery of the universe.</p>

    <p>This gene mutation is not that mutated!</p>

    <p>Meanwhile. On the Island of the Sun.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the scene in front of him in surprise. He was also thinking deeply in his heart.</p>

    <p>As one of the few ordinary people who know that Father Wang and Mother Wang are indeed powerless.</p>

    <p>The girl subconsciously thought of the person behind Father Wang's move. It must be Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Judging from the content of the video, it looks a bit like the "attunement technique" of classmate Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Could it be that it inspired Uncle Wang's left and right arms?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling did not tell Sun Rong about this.</p>

    <p>But with Sun Rong's current understanding of the boy, she still guessed the whole thing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is really too powerful...</p>

    <p>With just one shot of enlightenment, Uncle Wang, an ordinary man, could beat Fenmu Shen to death with a random punch.</p>

    <p>Although it's only one percent...</p>

    <p>But the opponent is the self-proclaimed overlord of the universe. A person of eternity level.</p>

    <p>With such huge energy, even one percent of the power is far beyond the level of the strongest True Immortal on earth.</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's tall and majestic image has improved a lot in Sun Rong's heart.</p>

    <p>"But... it's amazing. Ah Nuan girl was born just now. She can actually restrain Fenmu Shen's body." Wang Ming leaned next to Sun Rong to watch the live broadcast.</p>

    <p>He is actually one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. But he has not been added to the group. It is an operation to avoid suspicion.</p>

    <p>However, this does not actually prevent Wang Ming from obtaining information. If he wants to know anything, he can directly ask Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And now. After Sun Rong was pulled into the group, there were some things that Wang Ling refused to say. He could also ask Sun Rong! To put it bluntly, even if he is a future younger brother or sister, he is still one of his own.</p>

    <p>Of course. Just when the whole audience was cheering for Father Wang and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>There is one person who is outside the situation.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about? Why can't I understand?" Zhai Yin had a somewhat puzzled expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"Nothing." Wang Ming said proactively: "Ah Nuan girl was just born. Rongrong is showing me the photos."</p>

    <p>Regarding the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. Since there was no permission from Lord Diulei, Wang Ming had to do Tai Chi first.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Wang Nuan is born? Is this considered a premature birth?" Zhai Yin looked surprised: "Is it possible that she is very weak?"</p>

    <p>"That's right...but it's not weak."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Wang Ming glanced at Wang Ling subconsciously.</p>

    <p>He listened to Zhai Yin's words with a wry smile in his heart.</p>

    <p>The premature baby in your eyes. Now he is fighting against an eternal master who claims to be the overlord of the universe... How can he be called weak!</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ming's look, Zhai Yin felt that he understood: "Oh! I see! Is Ah Nuan girl the same as your brother? She is very powerful when she strikes?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. He couldn't help but reach out and pinch Zhai Yin's cheeks. He laughed: "Yinzi. I realize that sometimes you are really quite unaware."</p>

    <p>"These things are too complicated. Even if it were someone else, it would be difficult to accept them," Zhai Yin said.</p>

    <p>Then. Her next words made Wang Ming almost kneel down on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, how strong was Ah Nuan girl when she was born? Isn't she already a Foundation Building?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact. Wang Ling had already noticed the birth of Wang Nuan when he was in the waiting room.</p>

    <p>There is no active induction.</p>

    <p>It was purely a sixth sense based on blood relationship. It made Wang Ling realize that he finally had a biological sister.</p>

    <p>Across the vast ocean, Wang Ling, far away on Sun Island, took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Even from such a long distance, he could smell the baby's milky fragrance when Ah Nuan girl was born.</p>

    <p>After having an extra sister...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt a special feeling.</p>

    <p>He felt as if he was no longer alone.</p>

    <p>After so many years, all the loneliness and pain that has been sealed in my heart finally has a second person who can understand it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a "happy emotion" in his heart.</p>

    <p>But before this emotion could be fed back to the face through the brain nerves, it was suppressed by a force.</p>

    <p>Thus. Ah Nuan girl was born.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling On the surface, it seems to be much calmer than imagined.</p>

    <p>This is my sister's battle.</p>

    <p>In fact, he has been paying attention.</p>

    <p>Paying attention to every movement of Fenmu Shen's body. I'm afraid that the opponent will hit Ah Nuan girl too hard.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is actually very clear.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl couldn't wait to be born. In fact, she also wanted to challenge this eternal cosmic powerhouse...</p>

    <p>He thought he could provide some help to Ah Nuan girl when she needed it most.</p>

    <p>But judging from the current results.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl doesn't seem to need help...</p>

    <p>But.</p>

    <p>Just in case.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still gave Fenmu Shen a slap in the face.</p>
