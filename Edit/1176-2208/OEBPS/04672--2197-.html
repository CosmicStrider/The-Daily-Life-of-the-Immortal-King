  <h1>Chapter 2197 Using cultivation science to explain the system</h1>

  <div>

    <p>System capable person. This term is not new to Wang Ling. Father Wang, as an Internet writer, has also written many works on the subject of system flow. Internet literature can be regarded as completely clarifying system flow.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling knowing that there is indeed a system in the real world he lives in. That starts with the little black uncle Zhuo Yi knows.</p>

    <p>Back then, Wang Ling had kindly punished Uncle Hei's lab kid. This made Uncle Hei instantly become more honest.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Uncle Xiaohei is a system flow developer in the real world that Wang Ling knows. However, the system in reality is not that magical. He mainly relies on big data calculations to figure out the user's psychology. Allowing users to achieve a motivating effect in a sense, thus improving the capabilities of system users themselves.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of modern cultivation science, Wang Ling feels that half of it belongs to the category of scientific calculation and psychology. The other half is metaphysics in the true sense.</p>

    <p>The various systems developed by Uncle Hei over the years all involve certain ancient secret techniques. These secret techniques are the main reasons that help system flow users to grow their various abilities after completing specific tasks.</p>

    <p>You can also grow by simply practicing ancient secret arts. Uncle Hei has put on a system-like shell. It just makes these forbidden secret arts look less scary.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it also has certain entertainment attributes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the interview group shown to him by Huang. It was a crowd of thousands. Currently, the number of people in the group has reached nearly 800.</p>

    <p>There are more than 600 people online.</p>

    <p>If you include some social divers, then the number of people online is probably over a hundred.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little surprised: "Are... are there so many people participating in the interview?"</p>

    <p>"This is just one of the interview groups. As far as I know there are at least three interview groups."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said with a smile: "The main reason is that the remuneration conditions proposed by this company are quite generous. In addition to five insurances and one housing fund, the monthly salary is 50,000 spiritual stones. It is after tax. It works five days a week and has one month of annual leave. Not to mention. And there are commissions for mission bounties based on difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the higher the commissions will be."</p>

    <p>"The conditions are really good."Sun Rong sighed.</p>

    <p>Unless they are senior employees who have worked in the Huaguo Shuilian Group for many years and have been promoted, it is really difficult to offer such a salary and benefits.</p>

    <p>The larger the group, the more employees it has to support. It will definitely divide wages reasonably according to the gradient. It is really rare to see such a company with deep pockets and generous remuneration.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there are many people for this interview, which is also within Sun Rong's expectation.</p>

    <p>"Universe Infinity Group."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong silently wrote down the name of this company. It always seemed familiar.</p>

    <p>"Then I wish you, Mr. Huang, good luck in your interview!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ling raised their teacups together and drank tea with Lao Huang instead of wine.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang was so happy that he couldn't help but feel excited when meeting friends: "By the way. Actually, I wanted to ask you two when I was in the game world. What's your relationship?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong almost choked on his own tea.</p>

    <p>She hurriedly put down the tea cup. Perhaps she was afraid that Wang Ling would be embarrassed. She blushed and said duplicity: "It's just a normal... classmate relationship!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang showed a meaningful smile.</p>

    <p>"Maybe it's a little better than a normal schoolmate relationship. It's just a better relationship."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong added.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang raised his eyebrows, looking doubtful. There was a hint of amusement in his smile.</p>

    <p>The woman's attitude is actually very clear.</p>

    <p>But he saw that Wang Ling was still immersed in thinking with great interest. He immediately understood the relationship between the beautiful couple in front of him.</p>

    <p>It turns out that it's a woman chasing a man. Is it a veil?</p>

    <p>But the man seems to be a piece of wood. He has no intention of becoming enlightened...</p>

    <p>As a practitioner who has drawn a lot of comic content, Huang is very familiar with this type of script.</p>

    <p>Of course, the understanding of emotions here is not limited to the comic plot. It also has Lao Huang's own understanding. Although he feels that he is still single and is not qualified to preach to the two young people in front of him, but appropriate reminders can still be done. Give some.</p>

    <p>"There is no need to rush. Some things will come together slowly." Lao Huang looked at Sun Rong and comforted him.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded with a red face.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling. Still mindlessly eating crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>"What is classmate Wang looking at? He's so absorbed in watching it? There doesn't seem to be much to see in my group, right?" Lao Huang asked, looking at Wang Ling who was playing with his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling returned Lao Huang's mobile phone. Lao Huang suddenly discovered that this interview group, which had almost become a dating group, actually turned on the [all members mute] mode.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a brand new group announcement appeared in front of Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>This is an open interview task open to all interview groups!</p>

    <p>Action mission--Capture the smuggling alien organization Polyhedron!</p>
