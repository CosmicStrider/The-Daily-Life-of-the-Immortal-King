  <h1>Chapter 2125 Behavior Analysis of Big Data</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: It can be said that this general order has little effect on Wang Ling. He is an old conservative. And as a consistent lover of world pacifism, he naturally does not want to fight if he can.</p>

    <p>Looking at the history of Huaxiu, Huaxiu's growth and rise today are not due to plundering other countries.</p>

    <p>Of course. Although Wang Ling advocates world peace, it has to take action when it is time to take action. For example, against Bai Zhe and the upcoming battle in the future...</p>

    <p>He has sensed that war is inevitable, and all he can do is to do his best to protect his homeland and the fate of all mankind.</p>

    <p>During the days of studying at Number 60 High School. Wang Ling also realized the importance of the team. All this is due to Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Sun Rong... These seem to have been giving him A partner who causes trouble but can always wake him up at critical moments.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to take into account the overall situation by relying on oneself alone. The winner of the future war does not lie with him, but with whether the human monks can achieve true unity.</p>

    <p>This is the so-called community of destiny for human monks.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, even if he solves the Bai Zhe in front of him, there will be other "Bai Zhe" blocking the ground cultivators in the future. The road ahead will only be more difficult.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't know how long he can protect the earth. He feels that he is very powerful, but at the same time he is also very weak.</p>

    <p>So everything he is doing now is paving the way for the future of all human monks. It is also paving the way for his own ideal future.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the general order in his hand. Under the mask of General Huwei, Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>That is to say, this thing fell into his hands.</p>

    <p>If it were any other player, they would have given up on expanding their territory long ago.</p>

    <p>The purpose of him and Sun Rong is to quietly accumulate strength. They are waiting to support Mr. Zanghu at any time. If they start a big fight now, this will be an act of exposing their background and strength in advance.</p>

    <p>So the idea of Wang Ling is very clear.</p>

    <p>Now that he has the military power of Fuyun Town, he might as well just stay in this novice village and not leave. The key is to continue recruiting troops and accumulating strength here.</p>

    <p>And the general's order is not completely useless.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can use it for recruitment.</p>

    <p>At this time, he clicked on the map and looked at the level of the entire Fuyun Town. The income and expenditure of spiritual mines, spiritual trees, spiritual stones, and food supplies were in balance. There were no negative returns and no positive growth.</p>

    <p>The available troops are 2,000. The total population is 8,000.</p>

    <p>Size: small town.</p>

    <p>The overall rating is: Ding Shang</p>

    <p>The number of "Wolongs" that can be recruited with this rating is destined to be limited. Therefore, Wang Ling's next step is to raise the city level first. By investing in artificial resources to increase the basic natural resources such as spiritual mines, spiritual trees, and spiritual stones in the surrounding areas Mining. Build a town. Expand the population.</p>

    <p>However, if manpower is invested in mining, this will inevitably destroy the current consumption of edible materials and directly destroy the internal cycle of the current balance of payments.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling seem a little constrained.</p>

    <p>He is well aware of the difficulty of managing a sect. Therefore, although he was the first to plan the establishment of the Office of Strategic Deception, he has no intention of becoming the sect leader.</p>

    <p>There are so many people to manage. He can't take care of them.</p>

    <p>There are specialties in the art industry.</p>

    <p>Management itself is also a science.</p>

    <p>It's not necessarily possible to let him, a sociopath, be the boss...</p>

    <p>So it's best to have a ready-made boss to manage on his behalf. And Wang Ling only needs to provide support behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>But where did the ready-made boss come from?</p>

    <p>So at this time. Wang Ling turned his attention to Sun Rong again.</p>

    <p>He was shocked to find out.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Isn't he just a ready-made boss!?</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling also became more convinced.</p>

    <p>All this was arranged deliberately by Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, how could there be so many coincidences in this world?</p>

    <p>Do you really just want to come up with whatever you want?</p>

    <p>Impossible!</p>

    <p>Absolutely impossible!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Real world. Within the causal base.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is also really aggrieved.</p>

    <p>He swore he really didn't have it this time!</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling has misunderstood. So at this moment, Wang Ming has no other choice.</p>

    <p>He swore that he didn't want to explain anymore, so he just started typing frantically at the computer. Lines of code flew across the home screen at the speed of light, as if posting a barrage.</p>

    <p>Although Zhai Yin didn't understand a single line, he was probably aware of the helplessness on Wang Ming's face.</p>

    <p>"Are you showing off?" Zhai Yin asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"No...it's all God's will! God's will! God's will cannot be violated!" Wang Ming also couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>He swore that he really did not deliberately match up the ideas of Wang Ling and Sun Rong this time...but things had already come to this. Wang Ming felt that it was better for him to just become a villain for once. </p>

    <p>He could see that Wang Ling wanted Sun Rong to assist him in developing the city. So he simply typed the code. All system tasks received by Sun Rong followed Wang Ling's Come on.</p>

    <p>As for what Wang Ling is currently thinking. Wang Ming cannot read Wang Ling's thoughts. However, he can conduct predictive analysis through Wang Ling's key-pressing behavior when he clicks on the game operation interface.</p>

    <p>For example, when Wang Ling analyzes the map, the intelligent AI system starts to conduct review and deduction based on the behavior of Wang Ling. The highest probability situation is that Wang Ling wants to build City.</p>

    <p>Because the system analysis determined that Wang Ling had been staring at the number of resources on the map for a long time. He should be thinking about how to expand resources and expand the city.</p>

    <p>After closing the map, Wang Ling turned his attention to Sun Rong. This allowed the system to analyze that Wang Ling most likely wanted Sun Rong to assist him. Develop cities.</p>

    <p>In other words, although Wang Ming cannot read minds during the whole process, he can predict it through the player's behavior of clicking on the system operation page.</p>

    <p>Everything stems from the analysis of big data behavior patterns.</p>

    <p>In fact, this logic is common in many places.</p>

    <p>For example, when a player enters a certain game interface and selects the recharge link, the speed of the recharge may also affect the withdrawal rate to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>Players who recharge quickly. www.uukanshu.net basically don't think too much, so the recharge speed is very fast. And this behavior also tells the game company that this "boss" is not short of money. He can earn more money.</p>

    <p>Then you can let the "boss" keep recharging money by reducing the probability of withdrawing money.</p>

    <p>If the recharge speed slows down, it means that this person is probably a student party and is still hesitating whether to spend the money. Then the best way to deal with it is to maintain the normal probability. Or even increase the probability of withdrawal.</p>

    <p>All student members have a desire to show off. Once the goods are shipped and they get the gold card they want, they will definitely show off to their friends around them. This will lead to more other peers getting involved, and they will be unable to extricate themselves from the happy krypton gold card drawing.</p>

    <p>Of course, the above reasoning is just Wang Ming's personal thoughts.</p>

    <p>This is only theoretically possible.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have any other evidence.</p>
