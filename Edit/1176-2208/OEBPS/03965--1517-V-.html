  <h1>Chapter 1517 Hacker Old V</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Those who keep saying that the Foundation Building is still the same after repairing it for a long time should take a look at you. Like me..."</p>

    <p>"I look at you. Filled with envy."</p>

    <p>"Cultivators have accumulated wealth for thousands of years. All the spells, magical weapons, knowledge and moves. It's like a gift specially prepared for you."</p>

    <p>"Elixirs are given birth to, monsters are defeated and upgraded, treasures are hunted for, leapfrog battles... the fruits of cultivation civilization are opened up layer by layer. You can enjoy them to your heart's content."</p>

    <p>"Learn a spell freely. Learn a routine. Join a sect. Go to a distant place to practice."</p>

    <p>"Many people. You have been reborn in a different world of cultivation since the beginning."</p>

    <p>"Many people enter their forties in childhood."</p>

    <p>"Don't wonder what the enemy is doing."</p>

    <p>"What's the level difference?"</p>

    <p>"The distance between realms is broken."</p>

    <p>"You can win cups in the same world or different worlds just by using the same routine. You have the rights we once dreamed of. The rights of the protagonist..."</p>

    <p>"Run Houlang!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A video produced by Wang Ming using technology similar to a virtual anchor.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man in the video and the sexy magnetic subwoofer were all made by Wang Ming using technical means.</p>

    <p>But even so, the speech video still shocked the students of Jiudaohe High School who were watching.</p>

    <p>Student Union Office. After the orientation party.</p>

    <p>Kongque Nan and Ma Jiao came here.</p>

    <p>The angle of the student union office. You can just see the location of the dormitory building.</p>

    <p>The two were planning to enjoy the grand scene of the Rainbow Seven Gang attacking Wang Ling ahead. Unexpectedly, after Kongque entered the rankings, he was also forced to push a video about {Cultivator Houlang}.</p>

    <p>"What is this..."</p>

    <p>After reading it, Kongque was so scared that he almost dropped his phone.</p>

    <p>A look of astonishment appeared on his face: "Senior Ma Jiao. Something is wrong. All the names on this ranking list have become Houlang..."</p>

    <p>"How could that happen?" Ma Jiao frowned.</p>

    <p>She is extremely confident in her hacking skills.</p>

    <p>And the operation just now made her feel even more invulnerable.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that the hands and feet I moved would be easily cracked in such a short time.</p>

    <p>In order to stabilize the revised ranking of Wang Ling, Ma Jiao also added many defensive walls after hacking into the system...</p>

    <p>As a result, she didn't expect that the code she typed would be as brittle as paper.</p>

    <p>And when Ma Jiao took the phone from Kongque and saw the changes in the rankings, she had an incredible expression on her face.</p>

    <p>Quickly connect Kongque's mobile phone to his computer using a data cable.</p>

    <p>After a frantic operation on the keyboard, the expression on Ma Jiao's face gradually changed from disbelief to panic: "It can't be like this..."</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, a virtual animated character wearing the same mask as "V for Vendetta" occupied her entire computer screen.</p>

    <p>As one of the top experts in the hacker industry, Ma Jiao recognized this person's identity at a glance.</p>

    <p>This is the number one hacker in the world... Old V!</p>

    <p>He is also a senior in the industry that Ma Jiao has always admired.</p>

    <p>On the screen, Old V was holding an altar table with both hands. On the altar table, there was a small red sandalwood three-legged incense burner.</p>

    <p>Old V did not speak. He just used the code scrolled below to communicate encryptedly with Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>If converted into text...</p>

    <p>Will form the following sentences.</p>

    <p>"I have all your information."</p>

    <p>"I advise you to stop."</p>

    <p>"This is your final warning."</p>

    <p>"otherwise."</p>

    <p>"I can only offer you incense."</p>

    <p>This is a language that only experienced hackers can understand.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao looked at the code. Her face was pale.</p>

    <p>"I know, senior! I won't do anything to Houlang Sang again!"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao quickly gave in.</p>

    <p>She can offend anyone. She can even dig out anyone's heart.</p>

    <p>But only for this Old V. She didn't want to offend...</p>

    <p>This is the top master in the hacker circle.</p>

    <p>Like Zhao Zilong, he freely enters and exits the security networks of other countries. He is a person who comes in and out but escapes unscathed.</p>

    <p>Almost every country's security network has the footprints left by Old V.</p>

    <p>But for this arrogant hacker, no one could do anything against him...</p>

    <p>Over the years, she has worked hard to learn skills so that she can be closer to the idol she admires.</p>

    <p>So. Ma Jiao was completely excited.</p>

    <p>She tried to communicate using codes: "Old V-senpai! I... I've liked you for a long time!"</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ming did not expect that Ma Jiao was actually his fan.</p>

    <p>He smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>The codename Old V was acquired by him because he was young and ignorant.</p>

    <p>The second grade is full of success.</p>

    <p>It's just like the "WeChat ID" that many people took randomly when they were young.</p>

    <p>If WeChat hadn't given everyone the opportunity to revise it a while ago, I'm afraid there would still be people who still wouldn't be able to do it until now.</p>

    <p>I heard Ma Jiao said that she likes herself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately felt that this matter was easy to handle.</p>

    <p>If you are a fan...</p>

    <p>Well, Wang Ming naturally has his own way of dealing with fans.</p>

    <p>"What? Do you want to become a disciple?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming uses brain waves to release codes. Replied.</p>

    <p>"Can... can it be done?" Ma Jiao was excited.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes. But I want to test you."</p>

    <p>"Then what does senior want me to do?"</p>

    <p>"I want you to hide Houlang Sang completely before he leaves."</p>

    <p>"Hidden?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. He is the brother of a good friend of mine. And he doesn't like to be disturbed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Your behavior is actually causing trouble for me."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, senior. I didn't know he had anything to do with you..." Ma Jiao apologized sincerely.</p>

    <p>She really likes Old V.</p>

    <p>It's not just the kind of love that you admire.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao felt that she could even give everything she had for Old V. Even her life.</p>

    <p>Although the condition of being an apprentice is very tempting.</p>

    <p>But what she hopes even more is that she can become Old V's lover.</p>

    <p>"Senior! Can I be your girlfriend?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao once again plucked up the courage and said, "Senior, you don't need to answer me now... I know. It can be developed step by step. We can also start with the master-disciple relationship."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming supports his forehead.</p>

    <p>He was thankful that he was using code to communicate with Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin can't understand these things.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I will definitely be stripped of my skin...</p>

    <p>Although pretending to agree seems to be a good way to take advantage of Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming doesn't want that much.</p>

    <p>Such means are too despicable.</p>

    <p>It's scumbag behavior.</p>

    <p>He loves Yinzi deeply.</p>

    <p>Therefore. I don't intend to hide the fact that I have a girlfriend.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately replied: "Sorry. I already have someone I like."</p>

    <p>For a long time, Ma Jiao did not reply.</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes, Ma Jiao said: "It doesn't matter, senior. Then... just let me be your apprentice first."</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Confirm again the mission given to me by senior. All I need to do is hide Houlang Sang. That's enough, right..."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>After confirmation. Ma Jiao closed the network.</p>

    <p>Hide Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>In Ma Jiao's opinion, this matter is not too difficult.</p>

    <p>No matter how hidden it is on the Internet.</p>

    <p>It's better to do it directly.</p>

    <p>Just kill him...</p>
