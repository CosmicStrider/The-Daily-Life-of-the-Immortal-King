  <h1>Chapter 1237 Who is the Fool?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Cathedral of St. Pias. The base of the Messenger of the Moon.</p>

    <p>The glazed glass roof of the church reflects the colorful colors under the sunlight.</p>

    <p>If you sit in the middle of the church, you will have the illusion of living in a rainbow illusion.</p>

    <p>For every believer in God.</p>

    <p>This is undoubtedly a place that may be closest to God.</p>

    <p>A nun wearing a black gown and a veil walked into the church.</p>

    <p>She walked along the wide aisle. The bright moonlight filtered through the top of the wall, reflecting the peaceful face of the moon messenger.</p>

    <p>The Moon Messenger stared at the God mural on the prayer table with his silver eyes and prayed devoutly.</p>

    <p>After a while, her thoughts were pulled away. Her whole person turned into a black shadow and sat in the spiritual space.</p>

    <p>No one can imagine that the legendary messenger of the moon is only a nun in the church.</p>

    <p>At this time, she was sitting dignifiedly on the bench in the spiritual space.</p>

    <p>Only at this moment, the Moon Messenger felt like he had become God, looking down on all living beings.</p>

    <p>The existence of the foundation greatly satisfied her vanity.</p>

    <p>And this was the reason why she agreed to join the SBP in the first place.</p>

    <p>Moon Messenger opened his eyes. The orderliness of the people in this meeting was a bit unexpected.</p>

    <p>All the messengers from the 7 locations came.</p>

    <p>"Reliable news. Snake was killed by a strong man from the Office of Strategic Deception. Keorn betrayed us." The Judgment Messenger acted as the host of the meeting and explained the unfortunate news to everyone.</p>

    <p>Regarding Snake's death, everyone present had mixed reactions.</p>

    <p>The most shocked person was the Moon Goddess: "His strength actually died at the hands of the Office of Strategic Deception..."</p>

    <p>"What a useless waste." The chariot messenger hammered the table, looking very angry: "Didn't he get any information before he died?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all."</p>

    <p>Star Messenger smiled slyly. The information he received was no less than that from Judgment: "I don't think even Judgment Messenger would have thought that Snake would die in the hands of a security guard from the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"security guard?"</p>

    <p>The rest of the people were silent after hearing this.</p>

    <p>Many people's hearts are trembling wildly.</p>

    <p>It's not just the trial. Everyone here seems to underestimate the power of the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>How could there be a crazy sect using True Immortal as a security guard these days?</p>

    <p>Snake's strength is half a step to True Immortal... just a little short of leaping into True Immortal status.</p>

    <p>Snake can be defeated. Even if he is a security guard, he must at least have the strength of True Immortal.</p>

    <p>"I have organized a temporary retreat for the scavengers. I wonder what your opinions and thoughts are."</p>

    <p>Xu Bai looked at everyone here.</p>

    <p>As the host of the meeting. The legendary "Messenger of Judgment" of the Foundation.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had seen through everything.</p>

    <p>After becoming a more advanced being, the ability to acquire information is naturally extraordinary.</p>

    <p>He is able to communicate directly with the Lord of the Void. Ask for the Lord's assistance.</p>

    <p>Let the Lord use the supreme power of the void to get him all the answers he wants.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he actually already knows the identity of everyone here, including the residence of every messenger.</p>

    <p>Snake's death was something he had foreseen long ago.</p>

    <p>As long as there is a void sphere, he can absorb Snake's soul as soon as Snake dies, allowing Snake to transform into a high-level void spirit.</p>

    <p>At that time, as long as he kills anyone here, let Snake carry out the void invasion.</p>

    <p>He can control one more messenger in his hands.</p>

    <p>Then just repeat the above operation. The entire foundation will fall between his five fingers.</p>

    <p>But right now, the most important thing is acting.</p>

    <p>He cannot reveal everyone's identity directly.</p>

    <p>And whose body should Snake invade? Xu Bai was also deeply confused.</p>

    <p>He must first observe and observe. Who dares to disobey him?</p>

    <p>"It's too dangerous for the Scavengers to stay in Huaxiu Country. I think we should withdraw them all first and wait and see what happens." At this time, the Sun Messenger spoke: "The Scavengers have done a lot for the Foundation in these years. Once they fall. into the hands of other countries. Everything the Foundation does will be exposed."</p>

    <p>"But the problem is. Keorn is already in their hands, isn't it?" Chariot continued to pound the table. His temper was extremely grumpy.</p>

    <p>"The scavenger has a higher priority than these investigators. These investigators may not know the scavenger."</p>

    <p>Sun Messenger insisted on his point of view: "In these years, everything the scavenger has done has not left any trace. It is a beautiful thing, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Chariot was angry: "I still disagree! Captain Scavenger is dead. It is tantamount to the foundation being humiliated in another country! This place must be brought back!"</p>

    <p>The dispute between the sun and the chariot is expected. Their personalities are very different.</p>

    <p>However, after the two people expressed their opinions, the meeting seemed to have a focus.</p>

    <p>"Old rules. Whether the scavenger should go or stay, let's vote. The minority. Submit to the majority." Xu Bai spoke as the "messenger of judgment."</p>

    <p>Sun Messenger is considering the long-term development of the foundation. But he seems to prefer Chariot Messenger's approach.</p>

    <p>In any power dispute, if all plans are too conservative, sooner or later they will be eroded step by step.</p>

    <p>The foundation is under his control. It must become stronger.</p>

    <p>Then it is crucial to establish prestige for the foundation.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai is not afraid of Office of Strategic Deception at all.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, the existence of the Office of Strategic Deception is just a stepping stone for the development of his foundation.</p>

    <p>Destined to serve him.</p>

    <p>"I support Chariot's point of view." So, he spoke first to express his attitude.</p>

    <p>The moderator gives priority to expressing opinions. This situation is rare.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Sun Messenger felt a trace of anger in his heart.</p>

    <p>There is a feeling that one is being targeted.</p>

    <p>And when he saw other envoys voting one after another, this surging anger was even more intense.</p>

    <p>"Moon! Stars! Destiny! What do you three mean?"</p>

    <p>The sun questioned the three people: "Moon, don't you always advocate peace? How could you agree to such a violent behavior of the chariot messenger!"</p>

    <p>Sister Moon was silent. She actually had no opinion of her own. Following the crowd was her usual approach.</p>

    <p>Star Messenger: "Although what Sun Messenger said makes sense. But I always follow my own judgment."</p>

    <p>At this time, the Sun Messenger looked at Destiny. Just like before, the Destiny Messenger fell into silence again.</p>

    <p>Finally, all eyes in the audience turned to the only person who did not express his opinion.</p>

    <p>"Fool, what's your opinion?" Xu Bai stared at the black figure sitting at the end and narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Fools often leave meetings in the middle of the meeting.</p>

    <p>This is the only time when the Fool does not leave.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that the Fool's vote has no meaning.</p>

    <p>Even if he voted for the Sun, the chariot was destined to win in this vote.</p>

    <p>In the silence, everyone seemed to hear a rustling sound. It seemed that someone was chewing something.</p>

    <p>"Who is eating snacks during the meeting?" Xu Bai asked in surprise.</p>

    <p>Everyone followed the sound.</p>

    <p>I was surprised to find that this voice came from the Fool in position 7. It came from the black shadow that the Fool incarnated...</p>

    <p>Although everyone could not see the Fool's face and could only see a group of black shadows, they could clearly see the movements of this black shadow.</p>

    <p>The Fool seemed to have opened a new bag of packaging. He took out the seasoning packet from the packaging bag. He tore it open skillfully and sprinkled it in.</p>

    <p>Then put your hands together and crush the snack into pieces...</p>

    <p>Xu Bai looked at this scene and was shocked.</p>

    <p>In his understanding, the previous Fool was definitely not like this! He had no habit of eating snacks!</p>

    <p>But who is this fool?</p>

    <p>And the action of opening the snack bag seemed a bit familiar to Xu Bai...</p>

    <p>His eyes were touching.</p>

    <p>Deep in my heart, there was an inexplicable feeling of fear that was aroused at this time.</p>
