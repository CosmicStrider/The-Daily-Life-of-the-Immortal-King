  <h1>Chapter 1950 Teng Luchen's Test</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Thursday, January 16th. Teng Luchen successfully received the video information of the first internal beta test of the spirit world from Jing Heqiu.</p>

    <p>According to the content provided in this video material, Wang Ling hardly made much contribution during an internal beta test in the spirit world. He just sat there and took care of Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Rokume Akahoko from Sun Island led his troops to kill everyone.</p>

    <p>What surprised Teng Luchen even more was that the weapon of this Rokume Akahoko was actually Qu Shuling and Li Changzhe who fainted!</p>

    <p>In the video, this girl is holding up the ankles of two men. She treats them as spiritual swords and wields two giant humanoid swords to kill everyone on the scene...</p>

    <p>For a moment, Teng Luchen and Jing Heqiu were both speechless. Their jaws dropped. They were completely shocked by Rokume Akahoko's performance.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen imagined countless scenes. Before getting the video, he was even looking forward to Wang Ling's performance. As a result, this girl from Sun Island took all the limelight.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen..."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu scratched his head: "Teng Lao, are you sure this kid is the hidden master you have been eyeing for many years? It's not like that at all. He made no contribution at all in this scene. You had previously doubted whether he was providing hints to others. Manipulating the game behind the scenes. But it doesn't look like it now..."</p>

    <p>Providing hints and assisting teammates. In fact, he was in the dark controlling the entire game. This was Teng Luchen's initial guess about Wang Ling's positioning.</p>

    <p>He believes that the reason Number 60 High School can win again and again is all because of the secret help of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But judging from the video just now, Wang Ling does not obviously provide hints. Moreover, it does not convey fluctuations in heart sounds.</p>

    <p>The system in the spirit world comes with a telepathic monitoring device. If students participating in the competition use sound transmission to communicate, they will be captured by the magical device.</p>

    <p>Even if the complete conversation was not captured, at least there were fluctuations in the magic weapon. This can prove that someone used the sound transmission technique.</p>

    <p>However, in the current system, the monitoring part related to the sound transmission technology can almost be described as "no troubles."</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, even if Wang Ling really manipulated the game, a normal person's brain circuit would never think of using two unconscious people as weapons to hit spiritual beasts...</p>

    <p>And this is too out there. It does not conform to Teng Luchen's basic positioning of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Rokume Akahoko is truly a cultivator trained by the island country. His ideas are novel.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoqiu. You may not quite understand my guess. But I really think there is something wrong with this person."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen's unyielding attitude surprised Jing Heqiu.</p>

    <p>So far, they still haven't caught any clues about Wang Ling. Except for the last time the Office of Strategic Deception acted rashly as if to cover Wang Ling, they can't find any other clues. The mistake was made.</p>

    <p>Even Teng Luchen was prepared to prevent himself from losing his memory. However, the information wall has not been put to use yet.</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao..."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu sighed: "There is something I want to say. I don't know whether I should say it or not."</p>

    <p>"You said."</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao. I just don't understand. Even if this person really has a problem. He is a hidden master you think. Then why does Teng Lao have to dig him out and make him public?"</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu stood up, bowed, and said respectfully: "Even if you are hiding in the city, as long as you have the world in your heart and your heart is bright, you can still contribute to the country. If the other person is really a hidden master, you and I Testing it twice. It is actually a very rude behavior."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Teng Luchen fell into silence for a while.</p>

    <p>He felt that what Jing Heqiu said was indeed reasonable.</p>

    <p>But for so many years, he continued to track down Wang Ling. It has almost become an obsession.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Teng Luchen stood up and said: "Xiaoqiu, I know what you are saying. But there is one thing you misunderstood. I don't want to make him public to the world. Since he is a talent, of course I have to treat him well." It was protected. How could I not know that it should be made public to the world?</p>

    <p>It's a risk. "But why did Mr. Teng..."</p>

    <p>"You have the right to do it. This is a game I play to prove myself."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen frowned and smiled: "I have been in the world of cultivation for so many years. I still have the ability to recognize people. I don't believe it. This is the second closed beta. Can he still do it flawlessly?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Compared with the last closed beta of Spirit World, this time's closed beta doesn't have so many bells and whistles.</p>

    <p>All students who pass the test will be issued an electronic bracelet from the spirit world. Wang Ling's electronic bracelet was accidentally broken last time, so Wang Ming secretly sent him another one. It can be considered a perfect fit.</p>

    <p>Songhai City has established a teleportation chain with the city as a limited area. As soon as the spirit world test is opened, all students wearing the spirit world electronic bracelets within Songhai City will be immediately teleported into the spirit world no matter where they are. middle.</p>

    <p>When the second transmission was completed, Wang Ling looked at the time.</p>

    <p>4397. Thursday, January 16. 18:00:01...</p>

    <p>This is the time when school is over. Wang Ling was teleported away as soon as he arrived home.</p>

    <p>And the number of people participating in the second spiritual world internal beta was obviously more than the last time.</p>

    <p>The familiar mission wooden house. The familiar Huaxiu flag fluttering in the wind. Everyone gathered in front of the electronic screen in the wooden house. This time, the words "Underground Proving Ground Number 2-111" were displayed on the screen.</p>

    <p>"It seems that this time it is a single-person mission. 111 is the most special number of people in the mission." With the experience from the last time and Zhang Linyan's knowledge of the spiritual world these days, she explained to everyone.</p>

    <p>"That is to say, we are all fighting separately this time?" Li Changzhe asked. His voice was too careless. Wang Ling Even if he didn't look, he knew it was him.</p>

    <p>"It's said to be a single-player mission. But actually it's the total points in the final calculation."</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan said: "The electronic bracelets we wear on our hands are based on the country of cultivation. In other words, although everyone fights individually, we still have to score as many points as possible after entering the trial field. This can ensure that the total points are higher. The rest of the Cultivation Country's representative teams. I just don't know what the content of this test will be..."</p>

    <p>Last time they were collectively trapped in a desert oasis. Without any prompting, they were asked to cross the desert to a distant city.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what kind of problems the authorities will pose for them this time...</p>

    <p>But for the second internal beta test of the spiritual world, everyone is eager to try it.</p>

    <p>Because in this internal beta test of the spiritual world, all the rewards obtained during the mission can be brought out! In other words, as long as they are good enough, they can get unexpected cultivation resources and various kinds in this second internal beta test of the spiritual world. Benefits!</p>

    <p>However, although everyone was eager to give it a try at this time, Wang Ling's face remained calm.</p>

    <p>The elevator to the trial site has a maximum number of people. Qu Shuling was the first to press the elevator button and enter. There were many people following Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Because they are fighting on their own. Even if the same batch of elevators enter, there is a high probability that they will be scattered to different coordinates of the Number 2 Proving Ground.</p>

    <p>More than twenty people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was the last group to enter the elevator.</p>

    <p>The one following him was Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>The other one is Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>He heard Li Changzhe say before that this second spiritual world internal test is selective. Wang Ling didn't understand what this meant at first.</p>

    <p>As a result, when the three of them entered the elevator.</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Wang Ling felt the electronic bracelet on his hand vibrate.</p>

    <p>Then the next second, in Wang Ling's sight, three choices suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>[Option 1: Hold Li Changzhe's hand. Perform the mission with him. You will be transported to the same coordinates as him and experience the profoundness of Chinese culture. Mission reward: a random high-grade spiritual weapon]</p>

    <p>[Option 2: Hold Zhang Linyan's hand. Perform the mission with her. You will be transported to the same coordinates as her and develop a relationship. Mission reward: a random high-grade spiritual weapon]</p>

    <p>[Option 3: Ignore anyone. Perform the mission alone. Mission reward: A random high-grade immortal weapon, or just a packet of noodles.]</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the options. He was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Good guy. It turns out this is here. Waiting for you...</p>
