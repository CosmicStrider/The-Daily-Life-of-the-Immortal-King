  <h1>Chapter 1501 Warm Guardian Spirit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the moment when he fell off the cliff, Wang Ling was thinking about whether his acting skills were still good enough.</p>

    <p>Is there anything artificial or unnatural about it?</p>

    <p>He felt that there shouldn't be any.</p>

    <p>After all, when that person chose to push him down, he didn't see his face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wanted to pretend to be scared. Then he said "Oops."</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Wang Ling doesn't seem to know what fear is.</p>

    <p>The thing he has been most afraid of since he was a child is that he is afraid of blowing up the earth. Or he accidentally turns over while sleeping and fails to control his strength. Then when he wakes up, his home is gone.</p>

    <p>However, these things are just scary to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Far from reaching the point of panic.</p>

    <p>After those hands hidden in the darkness pushed Wang Ling down, a bit of a sinister smile appeared on his face.</p>

    <p>In the darkness, the cracked corners of his mouth and the big white teeth were particularly conspicuous.</p>

    <p>Just like Xiao Hei in a certain detective cartoon.</p>

    <p>"It's done... He's finally done!" In the darkness, the man's eyes widened. The whites of his bloodshot eyes showed a bit of madness. He kept mumbling in his mouth: "Perfect... too perfect. This parabola!"</p>

    <p>If you look closely along his body, you will find that he has no legs at all.</p>

    <p>The man's entire lower body was a shadow, connected to the ground. And just now he emerged from the ground.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is also a ghost. His name is: Pashan Gui...</p>

    <p>He only obeyed the orders of the Sixth Madam.</p>

    <p>Over the past many years, accidental cliff falls have occasionally occurred on Tiangan Mountain. Without exception, it was all his fault.</p>

    <p>His birth name is Zhang Xisheng. He is an excellent mathematics teacher. He is also very good at calculating functions, parabolas and the like.</p>

    <p>As a mathematics teacher, Zhang Xisheng has felt that he should not be limited to the stereotyped cases in textbooks.</p>

    <p>You should try the method by yourself and combine it with practical training to deepen the impression on the students.</p>

    <p>The crazy pursuit of practical training gradually increased Zhang Xisheng's mental pressure, and eventually evolved into depression without even knowing it.</p>

    <p>Zhang Xisheng's last practical training was to perform a perfect parabola. He jumped off the cliff in front of all the students on Tiangan Mountain.</p>

    <p>Then... he never came up again...</p>

    <p>Zhang Xisheng fell off a cliff and died. His deeds became a joke among many students.</p>

    <p>And over time. Zhang Xisheng became known as "Zhang Sacrifice." He became a negative example among the teachers.</p>

    <p>It has been recorded in the horror legend of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Those students who had witnessed Zhang Sacrifice fall off the cliff.</p>

    <p>In the end, they all suffered from depression. Each one of them chose to jump from a high place to end his life.</p>

    <p>They are like a group of cursed people.</p>

    <p>Those who don't have enough realm can die in just one jump.</p>

    <p>And those students with a slightly higher level may not die after jumping once. So they jumped a second time, a third time...</p>

    <p>Zhang Sacrifice has existed for a long time. People thought it was just a legend.</p>

    <p>But no one thought that this was actually a real ghost.</p>

    <p>"You didn't expect that... I, Zhang Sacrifice, really exist..."</p>

    <p>After completing the Sixth Madam's mission, Zhang Sacrifice's face looked proud and somewhat appreciative.</p>

    <p>He stared into the abyss below, as if staring at a work of art, admiring his criminal masterpiece.</p>

    <p>The Sixth Madam had told him that if this person fell, others would react...</p>

    <p>Among the three people from Number 60 High School, there is a hidden master.</p>

    <p>Zhang Sacrifice has been staring at Wang Ming since he went up the mountain.</p>

    <p>However, what puzzled Zhang Sacrifice was that the remaining few people didn't react at all...</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ming, Sun Rong walking towards the edge of the cliff.</p>

    <p>There was no trace of sadness on their faces. They were actually still laughing! Are... laughing!?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming curled his lips: "Hey, at this height, you can't kill Ling Ling, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also laughed: "Yeah. This distance can't hurt classmate Wang Ling. And it's not bad. The distance is not too high. And classmate Wang Ling also used {Big Light Body Technique" }."</p>

    <p>"If this were higher, just relying on the acceleration of gravity. Even when using {Big Light Body Technique}. With the physical strength of classmate Wang Ling, there would be a sudden violent impact with the ground. The power should be No less than a small nuclear warhead, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Mr. Zhang Sacrifice was stunned.</p>

    <p>Then the next moment, his expression became ferocious again!</p>

    <p>He hated those guys who clearly saw those people getting hurt but looked on with cold eyes.</p>

    <p>Especially this scene. It reminded Zhang Sacrifice of the time when he was struggling to teach and jumped off the cliff during the period of depression. The students standing on the cliff looked at him with cold eyes and laughed at his appearance...</p>

    <p>The overwhelming hatred made Zhang Sacrifice stretch out his claws again!</p>

    <p>Reach out to Wang Ming and Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>"I advise you to stop."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhang Sacrifice suddenly heard Wang Ming's voice coming from the edge of the cliff.</p>

    <p>The expression on Wang Ming's face was a smile. She turned to look at him.</p>

    <p>"Can you see me?" Zhang Sacrifice was shocked.</p>

    <p>"I can't. But my brother can." Wang Ming spread his hands helplessly and looked at Zhang Sacrifice.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Sacrifice saw that the dead fish-eyed boy who had been pushed down by him before appeared unscathed behind Wang Ming as if by magic.</p>

    <p>Then, they stood next to Wang Ming. Both brothers looked at him helplessly.</p>

    <p>"This... this is impossible!"</p>

    <p>He was obviously a ghost. But Zhang Sacrifice was frightened by Wang Ling at this moment.</p>

    <p>He roared in disbelief: "I've... pushed him down! The most perfect parabola!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>Although this ghost is indeed very strong, it doesn't seem very smart.</p>

    <p>When being pushed down by Zhang Sacrifice. Wang Ling did have the idea of getting rid of Zhang Sacrifice.</p>

    <p>But after he saw Zhang Sacrifice's memory, that idea was instantly dismissed.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling who has King's Eyes and Fate abilities.</p>

    <p>It is so easy to read the reason why a ghost takes shape in an instant.</p>

    <p>In fact, in the days when Zhang Sacrifice first became a ghost, he was a ghost with good intentions.</p>

    <p>And such ghosts are also defined as "guardian spirits" among ghosts.</p>

    <p>Because of his madness for teaching, he fell into severe depression, which eventually led to the unfortunate incident of climbing a mountain and falling off a cliff.</p>

    <p>Zhang Sacrifice worries that his students will make the same mistake.</p>

    <p>He incarnates as the "guardian spirit" of all students. He ensures that the students he teaches can grow up safely and healthily...</p>

    <p>Until one day, the existence of Zhang Sacrifice was discovered by Madam Six.</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady tampered with Zhang Sacrifice's memory.</p>

    <p>He changed those cute, kind-hearted students into cold-blooded and indifferent appearances, which gradually inspired Zhang Sacrifice's inner hatred...</p>

    <p>He forgot the students who loved his teaching style and cried bitterly when he jumped off the cliff.</p>

    <p>He forgot the anxiety and despair of the students when they organized the rescue that day. Regardless of the danger, they went down the mountain to find Teacher Zhang's whereabouts without waiting for the rescue team to arrive...</p>

    <p>Although in the end, the result was of no avail.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw it all.</p>

    <p>He immediately changed his mind.</p>

    <p>Teacher Zhang is a good teacher.</p>

    <p>Every wrongdoer has his own debtor. All the ledgers should be recorded in the account of the Sixth Lady...</p>

    <p>"Relieve yourself..."</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought. He stretched out his index finger and gently placed it on Zhang Sacrifice's forehead...</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>After a golden light passed.</p>

    <p>All tampered memories are instantly corrected.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the man thought of his true mission.</p>

    <p>Two tears streamed down from his eyes...</p>

    <p>"Thank you..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Sacrifice with a smile. Parted in front of all of them.</p>

    <p>A teacher who only thinks about his students even after his death should not be treated like this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used his own power to free Zhang Sacrifice and sent him to reincarnation.</p>

    <p>And in the next reincarnation, Zhang Sacrifice will still be an outstanding, accomplished, and beloved people's teacher by students...</p>

    <p>"Is it all over?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"eh..." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact. The whole process happens in a very short time.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming hadn't even come out of the toilet yet. This "Pashan Gui" Zhang Sacrifice was successfully dealt with.</p>

    <p>Later, Wang Ling shared the original memory of Zhang Sacrifice that he saw with Wang Ming, Sun Rong and Zhai Yin, who had been looking at it in shock.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that classmate Wang Ling, you are so powerful..." Zhai Yin came over. The expression on his face was indescribable surprise.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has a showdown.</p>

    <p>He felt that this was actually a good opportunity.</p>

    <p>"Yinzi. This is actually what I have been hiding from you."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming said: "As you can see, my brother is very strong... that's why I need to develop Talisman to suppress his power. Otherwise, he will not be able to control himself."</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I really didn't expect that your brother at this age would actually have the strength of Soul Formation..." Zhai Yin felt that the amount of information was a bit huge.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ming, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhai Yin saw the three people staring at him in confusion. He quickly said: "Don't worry. I will never tell anyone!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
