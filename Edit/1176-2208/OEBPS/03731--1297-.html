  <h1>Chapter 1297 Go and invite me Wang Ling Buddha!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I think Liu Chengru is probably crazy. How can he escape with Dao Supreme?" The head of the Sheng family bluntly said the name of the wealthy elder of the Liu family. He chuckled. I don't know what Liu Chengru was thinking.</p>

    <p>The spiritual consciousness of any one of their six Dao Gods can cover the entire divine realm in an instant.</p>

    <p>Not to mention 3 minutes. Even if Liu Chengru is given 30 more minutes, they can dig him out even if he buries himself in the ground.</p>

    <p>As soon as the bet started, Liu Chengru turned into a streak of light and shadow and disappeared.</p>

    <p>His speed is extremely fast.</p>

    <p>There are only three minutes left. All the magic weapons and props that can be used to speed up are used.</p>

    <p>At this time, the "Kun Peng Ling", the anti-boundary magical weapon that Liu Chengru specially borrowed from the head of the Liu family, played a vital role.</p>

    <p>It is mixed with 2% of the power of chaos, which increases the power by nearly 10% on the original basis.</p>

    <p>When he holds it, he injects spiritual power. His arms can turn into Kunpeng wings in a short period of time. In the blink of an eye, they will disappear at the end of the horizon.</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru knew that he would definitely not be able to escape if he ran.</p>

    <p>His ultimate goal is to find a deserted place.</p>

    <p>The best direction is naturally the direction of Shenhai!</p>

    <p>"There's still 1 minute left..."</p>

    <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Liu Chengru waved his broad Kunpeng wings.</p>

    <p>The moment he was about to approach the surface of the Divine Sea, he put it away and plunged into the Divine Sea.</p>

    <p>The sea area of the Divine Sea is luminous. Its depth is even darker and darker. Every time you dive one meter, you will bear huge pressure.</p>

    <p>Forty thousand meters below the seabed of the Divine Sea, there is no sign of life.</p>

    <p>The maximum diving distance of Dao Supreme is about 5,000 meters.</p>

    <p>And Dao God. can dive directly under 40,000 meters. This is a huge gap in realm.</p>

    <p>At this time, close to the limit of the deep sea, Liu Chengru's eyes emitted light, like a searchlight.</p>

    <p>In a trench right in front of him was an ancient ruins of the Divine Realm. There were ancient buildings eroded by the sea water of the Divine Sea. These buildings had become extremely fragile due to years of seawater immersion. They could be torn apart with a gentle break.</p>

    <p>There are various immortal ships, spirit boats and even the bones of cultivators hanging on the trench walls in the trench.</p>

    <p>The Divine Sea in the Divine Realm is an extremely mysterious place.</p>

    <p>Countless divine cultivators have borrowed modern power to explore here.</p>

    <p>And more people are buried here forever.</p>

    <p>The choice of this trench was something Liu Chengru had planned for a long time. There are few traces of biological activity near this trench. It smells like a submarine garbage dump.</p>

    <p>Buildings, rubbish and the bones of dead creatures are all piled up in this trench.</p>

    <p>It exudes a very foul smell all year round.</p>

    <p>"Finally arrived." Liu Chengru was completely relieved when he reached his destination.</p>

    <p>Basically everything went as he expected.</p>

    <p>And soon, Liu Chengru, who was about 5,000 meters above sea level, felt the powerful aura penetrating from the sea.</p>

    <p>He ran for three minutes.</p>

    <p>Dao God chased him three minutes later, but it only took less than three seconds.</p>

    <p>The opponent was chasing at such a terrifying speed. Relying on the powerful spiritual lock, Liu Chengru knew that he had no room to escape.</p>

    <p>Soon, six groups of divine fire appeared on the seabed.</p>

    <p>It is the flame emanating from the body after the six Dao Gods light up the core world. It is also called the divine fire.</p>

    <p>This is also one of the "symbols of Dao God."</p>

    <p>However, divine fire has no other blessing effects.</p>

    <p>It is mostly used by Dao God as a human flashlight.</p>

    <p>The lighting is also excellent in extremely dim conditions...</p>

    <p>"Eh? Kunpeng Ling?" Through the light of the divine fire, the head of the Sheng family saw clearly what Liu Chengru was holding.</p>

    <p>He knew that this was one of the magical weapons that Liu Fengnan, the head of the Liu family, was proud of.</p>

    <p>"Liu Fengnan actually gave you the Kunpeng Ling?" The head of the Sheng family laughed: "Is he closed-minded and confused? You are just a Dao Supreme. Even with the blessing of the Kunpeng Ling, there is no way you can outrun us."</p>

    <p>In his opinion, the Kun Peng Ling given by Liu Fengnan.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it's going to be for nothing. It's an anti-boundary weapon that is fused with 2% of the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>It has great collection value.</p>

    <p>"Liu Chengru. You have lost. Then according to the agreement, accept the punishment..." The head of the Li family took action directly.</p>

    <p>He was not polite.</p>

    <p>His right arm expanded infinitely as it stretched out, like a mountain surrounding the elder of the Liu family.</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru felt that he could still struggle a little longer.</p>

    <p>He activated the Kun Peng Ling. He opened his wings and flapped them violently. The sea water in front of him immediately boiled!</p>

    <p>Affected by the resistance of the sea water in the Divine Sea, all actions in the Divine Sea will slow down.</p>

    <p>Especially when the water suddenly became turbulent, Liu Chengru decided that the other party might not be able to catch him so easily.</p>

    <p>"The worm shakes the tree. I don't know what it means..." However, the power of Dao God was still manifested at this moment.</p>

    <p>The hand of the head of the Li family is covered with the Dao God seal, ignoring the resistance of the sea water.</p>

    <p>He grabbed it with one hand, like "fishing for the moon in the sea", and wrapped Liu Chengru completely in his palm.</p>

    <p>"Caught."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family was extremely proud.</p>

    <p>The other five gods followed and watched Liu Chengru being caught in the hands of the head of the Li family.</p>

    <p>"It's just Dao Supreme. How dare you be so different?" the five family heads sneered.</p>

    <p>"So it turns out that gods also work together to bully people? With you, you are worthy of being called gods?" Liu Chengru looked cold.</p>

    <p>He was calm in his heart. Even in the gazes of the six Dao Gods, he showed no trace of fear.</p>

    <p>This made the head of the Li family feel very strange: "I don't know how you, little Dao Supreme., get your confidence?"</p>

    <p>He squeezed Xie's hand tightly. This made clan elder Liu Chengru instantly feel the pain of being squeezed out of his body.</p>

    <p>"You are just about to die and you are still pretending. It's really ridiculous..."</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru resisted the pain and retorted: "Master is right. It's time for God's Domain to be baptized... Even people like you can be Gods. The future of God's Domain is bleak and boundless!"</p>

    <p>"Shut up!" the head of the Li family scolded. He wanted to crush Liu Chengru right now. However, he felt that if Liu Chengru died now, it would not be enough to establish his authority.</p>

    <p>So, the head of the Li family sneered: "Liu Chengru, you are willing to admit defeat. I will execute you in front of the Liu family members in front of the gate of Liucheng!"</p>

    <p>"Will I be executed?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family looked cold: "You are disrespectful to God. This is what you will end up with."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry..." Liu Chengru said suddenly.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"I said, I'm sorry... the people who might die are you..."</p>

    <p>Then, he opened his mouth wide and spit out the golden talisman given to him by Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>"Do you think a golden talisman can save your life?" the head of the Li family pondered.</p>

    <p>"That's not necessarily the case."</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Chengru laughed loudly. Then he looked up to the sky and shouted: "Go and invite me Wang Ling Buddha!!!"</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>The golden talisman vibrates!</p>

    <p>Then a blazing bright light burst out!</p>

    <p>A hand descended from the sky. Covering the sky and the sun, it pierced directly into this divine sea!</p>

    <p>Come again...</p>

    <p>The six Dao Gods trembled in an instant.</p>

    <p>Everyone feels that the death omen star is coming above their heads!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Is this! Ling Zhenren's hand?"</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception In the main hall of the True Lord. Everyone was shocked.</p>

    <p>The next moment. A split screen screen appeared on the screen.</p>

    <p>Switch directly to the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling was bored and reaching out to mess with the square fish tank in front of him.</p>

    <p>Then, with his slender and white fingers, he picked up six small stones in the fish tank...</p>
