  <h1>Chapter 1317: Groundhog's Survival on Earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sending the groundhog back to the west again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the huge palm print on the moon's surface. The expression on his face was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Although the moon has been "strengthened" by him, the destructive power of the God-Destroying Blow is extremely huge. It still severely damaged the surface.</p>

    <p>The groundhog is dead.</p>

    <p>And Moon Spirit himself was slapped by Wang Ling. He felt very wronged: "Uuuuu Ling Zhenren. Can you fix me..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded firmly.</p>

    <p>Originally, the surface of the moon was bumpy and bumpy. Now after the destruction of the war, it looks even more uneven and miserable.</p>

    <p>There is no other way.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand. Ready to start casting the Heavenly Dao spell on the moon's surface to repair it.</p>

    <p>But the Moon Spirit always had an ominous premonition: "Wait! Ling Zhenren! Which Heavenly Dao spell... are you using?"</p>

    <p>Which one?</p>

    <p>Of course it's "major repair" combined with the legendary "macrodermabrasion!"</p>

    <p>First, use a major repair technique to maintain the entire surface. Then use microdermabrasion to remove the bumpy parts of the moon's surface.</p>

    <p>However, the principle of microdermabrasion is a bit like peeling an apple. It will be peeled until the surface of the moon becomes smooth.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Moon Spirit's whole body felt bad: "Don't... Ling Zhenren, you can just fill in the deep holes on the surface. Grind the skin. I don't think it's necessary..."</p>

    <p>Is it really unnecessary?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Confirm.</p>

    <p>"No!" Moon Spirit said firmly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling showed a faint look of disappointment on his face.</p>

    <p>Only then did he discover to his surprise.</p>

    <p>The "Sister Moon" mentioned in the storybooks when I was a kid were all lies!</p>

    <p>This Moon Spirit is a serious "straight man!"</p>

    <p>Only straight men don't care about their bumpy faces!</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling's fingertips lit up with a light.</p>

    <p>The light of the "Great Restoration Technique" shone down, making the surface of the moon, the palm prints, and the deep pits caused in the previous battle all restored to their original appearance.</p>

    <p>"It's so cool! What kind of spell is this! It's so cool!" The moon spirit monster, shrouded in the light of the great repair spell, shouted.</p>

    <p>It was halfway through repair. Wang Ling suddenly looked shocked.</p>

    <p>He felt that he would not notice anything wrong.</p>

    <p>This is indeed the smell of that prairie dog...</p>

    <p>"Can you actually be resurrected without any cost?"Wang Ling feels incredible.</p>

    <p>But this time the groundhog seemed to take a little longer.</p>

    <p>And the location of resurrection is not the location where he died before.</p>

    <p>It's the direction of the earth!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quickly turned his gaze away.</p>

    <p>This groundhog actually went to earth?</p>

    <p>But isn't there a restriction left by Dao Ancestor on this earth...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was confused.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the groundhog wanted to do.</p>

    <p>But in this case, it would actually be more difficult for him to handle.</p>

    <p>Because it is impossible for him to directly touch the earth like he did to the moon spirit.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that if you want to kill the groundhog accurately, you must increase the damage to the level of "God-Destroying Blow."</p>

    <p>It's okay for him to take pictures of the moon. If he takes pictures of the earth... I'm afraid a group of innocent cultivators will suffer.</p>

    <p>We must find a way to move this difficult prairie dog to another place!</p>

    <p>No time to think too much.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's body flashed. The whole person disappeared in front of the moon spirit.</p>

    <p>The moon spirit feels wronged.</p>

    <p>He's not done enjoying it yet!</p>

    <p>"This damn groundhog... don't let me get the chance to take revenge!" Moon Spirit said angrily to himself.</p>

    <p>Being interrupted in the process of enjoying yourself. This feeling of discomfort and anger. Only the person involved can understand it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Gray Mist appeared on the earth in full state.</p>

    <p>This is indeed a last resort move.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be controlled as soon as he was resurrected. Then he would be beaten violently and sent directly to the land abandoned by the gods...</p>

    <p>The full-status resurrection permission left to him by Dao Ancestor is indeed not unlimited.</p>

    <p>And there are not many times left in his hands.</p>

    <p>Although there are restrictions left by Dao Ancestor on Earth, they will limit most of his strength.</p>

    <p>But it is precisely because of the existence of this restriction that Heavenly Dao cannot track his location as long as he is on the earth.</p>

    <p>This prohibition is a double-edged sword.</p>

    <p>When he appears on Earth, he can produce a resonance reaction like a Heavenly Dao signal jammer.</p>

    <p>So he hid on earth. Although it would limit his strength.</p>

    <p>But the earth is actually a good place to hide.</p>

    <p>In short. That scary boy from Earth.</p>

    <p>Use the normal method to fight. It will definitely be defeated.</p>

    <p>The damage is too high.</p>

    <p>Not even his chaotic gray mist can withstand it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the extremely clever Gray Mist Lord came up with a plan.</p>

    <p>Although he can't kill Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But if we can find the life gate of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>For example, threaten him by taking away his important things!</p>

    <p>Then let this screen-peeping dog commit suicide in front of him!</p>

    <p>Then you can also win!</p>

    <p>This method may be a little more sinister.</p>

    <p>But there is a saying that a soldier never tires of deceit!</p>

    <p>As for the goal, Mr. Gray Mist has already thought about it.</p>

    <p>When fighting in space before.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist has actually been noticing that there is a secret satellite coming from the direction of the earth that is remotely observing the contest between him and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>You don't need to think about it to know that the girl who spied on them through the satellite must be a very important person.</p>

    <p>At that time, Mr. Gray Mist had already explored the spiritual consciousness.</p>

    <p>And at this moment.</p>

    <p>He is already in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Because of the speed, almost no one noticed his existence.</p>

    <p>The groundhog quickly locked the location of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Is it actually underground?" After confirming the location, he was overjoyed.</p>

    <p>This underground place is his home ground!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Located in the underground retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>The girl is thinking seriously about "bribery!"</p>

    <p>She does have her own experience with bribing her sister.</p>

    <p>When I was a child, I wanted to build a relationship with Sun Yu.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong often gives gifts to his sister.</p>

    <p>But most of the things girls like are different.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, in a family.</p>

    <p>No matter they are brothers, sisters or siblings, they can all find commonalities in the things they like.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong The school girl seems to rarely show such a sad expression."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi saw the girl thinking hard about what gift to give. I couldn't help laughing in my heart.</p>

    <p>"First impression is important!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said with a serious expression: "But there's no rush. After I'm resurrected, I'll have a long time to go on field trips!"</p>

    <p>This set of rules for improving favorability.</p>

    <p>Except for the fact that she failed to succeed with Wang Ling many times, she is still very confident in others!</p>

    <p>Just do a little research. You can always know what sister Wang Nuan likes!</p>

    <p>"You don't have any doubt. What if master really can't save you?" Zhuo Yi asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"no."</p>

    <p>The girl smiled slightly and answered without hesitation.</p>

    <p>From the moment I clearly sensed the true strength of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong already knew it in his heart.</p>

    <p>In this world, maybe there really is nothing that classmate Wang Ling cannot achieve!</p>

    <p>The only person who can save her is classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>But at this moment.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly felt something strange coming from above his head: "Senior Death Heavenly Dao. Something seems to be wrong?"</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is there any?"</p>

    <p>Because "Heavenly Dao Signal Jammer" was created.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao is simply unpredictable. The danger has arrived.</p>

    <p>It's just the blink of an eye!</p>

    <p>A sharp claw has pierced the ceiling.</p>

    <p>Then, the figure quickly jumped out of the pothole, picked up the Buddha Golden Lotus and ran away!</p>
