  <h1>Chapter 2100 It's your own fault.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A sound of rebuke is deafening. It shakes the heaven and the earth. It makes the surrounding sea water convolute and surge. The sound wave can spread to every corner of the earth.</p>

    <p>Today's Yi Jianchuan is in the holy realm after all. This roar was filled with anger. It directly caused the sword energy lingering on his body to spread with the sound waves. It had the effect of global broadcasting.</p>

    <p>Looking at the dense matrix of mechanical monks in the sky. Tens of thousands of troops gathered here in a short period of time. Mixiu's Emperor always held a trace of luck in his heart.</p>

    <p>Even if Huaxiu develops the "ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device", this mechanical monk... may not be purely mechanical!</p>

    <p>Puppet technology in the world of cultivation is now also very advanced. In the trial grounds of the spirit world, there are puppets made of psychic clay combined with spells. They only need to insert a chip.</p>

    <p>But as we all know, Mixiu has always been in a leading position in terms of Cultivation scientific research results in the field of chips.</p>

    <p>It is also a common tactic to rely on one's own technical means to retaliate against a cultivating country that cannot reach an agreement or to technically cut off supply.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu's chip technology can't keep up. A mechanized monk with purely mechanical components. This is simply a fantasy in Mixiu's Emperor's mind.</p>

    <p>It cannot be made purely mechanically!</p>

    <p>He doesn't believe it!</p>

    <p>At present, countries around the world are still focusing on researching puppet technology made of psychic clay. Even if it is combined with mechanical parts, it is still semi-mechanized.</p>

    <p>Purely mechanical monks. Due to material limitations, most of the robots produced by various countries are used in the service industry. They cannot be directly put into combat. Moreover, they cannot fly directly in human form.</p>

    <p>Therefore, for the puppets made of psychic clay, Michu, who has always been meticulous, naturally has corresponding countermeasures. This is a strategic planning measure to guard against the attack of a large number of puppet legions in the future.</p>

    <p>"Fire the railgun!"</p>

    <p>In the giant white tower, Mixiu's Emperor opened the mechanism of the desk. A red case with a glass cover rose from the center of the desk.</p>

    <p>When the people around him saw this, they immediately blocked him: "Master Emperor, no!"</p>

    <p>Everyone was sweating coldly. They didn't have the courage to fight, but they had the courage to make money in the name of war, and they were very bold!</p>

    <p>Everyone knows what this red button represents!</p>

    <p>This is Emperor's order!</p>

    <p>Emperor directly issued the order to mobilize the monks of the Cultivation Defense Association to directly carry out the first command of remote operations. There is no need to go through any parliamentary approval. Emperor only needs to make his own decision.</p>

    <p>Although the conditions for triggering the Emperor order vary from country to country, what it means once triggered is extremely clear.</p>

    <p>Once pressed. This is equivalent to declaring war with Huaxiu...</p>

    <p>Mixiu's Emperor is used to being proud. He has always been domineering and unreasonable. Although his staff often like to stir up trouble in public, most of the time they are quick to talk and do what they say with their hands. It's not necessarily a set of actions. It's the so-called inconsistency.</p>

    <p>His advisors were all talents recruited from around the world during the founding of Mixiu. Their pickiness stemmed from Mixiu's national circumstances, but they weren't actually stupid.</p>

    <p>Fighting now will only do a lot of harm and no good. It is possible to make money, but not if it involves too much risk.</p>

    <p>What's more, Mixiu now doesn't even know how Huaxiu came up with the "ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device"... This is a technology that has surpassed the current level of cutting-edge cultivation technology. The birth of this technology. It marks that the monk civilization on earth will directly enter the second level civilization stage!</p>

    <p>They've already lost!</p>

    <p>When you are not sure how far the other party has developed, you can no longer cause trouble easily!</p>

    <p>So the staff began to block him with their bodies. They were like football players. They threw Emperor directly to the ground and tried to hold Emperor down and calm him down.</p>

    <p>But sometimes when his emotions got the better of him, his subordinates rebelled one after another. At that moment, Mixiu's Emperor couldn't stand it anymore. The expression on his face was furious. His orange-red face was bloodshot.</p>

    <p>"You... are you going to rebel?" He shouted loudly. The more he was obstructed, the more he aroused a spirit of resistance.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Mixiu's Emperor is an extremely contradictory person in his heart. He wants to press the button. But he also hopes that someone can stop him the moment before he presses the button...</p>

    <p>So he struggled on this side, struggled with it, and got pushed around.</p>

    <p>Everyone then heard a "bang" sound coming from the office.</p>

    <p>What everyone didn't expect was that the red button of the Emperor Order was actually crushed by Mixiu's Emperor under the push of a group of staff!</p>

    <p>At the same time. Button trigger!</p>

    <p>At that moment, the office fell into a dead silence.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that once this button is pressed, it is equivalent to lighting a powder keg.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>In Mixiu territory, a rocket carrying the intercontinental ballistic missile head of a giant railgun at the Cultivation Rocket Launch Center shot into the sky as the command was triggered. It also changed its trajectory several times in the air and fired towards the sea restricted area!</p>

    <p>This railgun is a strategic countermeasure specifically designed to deal with the Puppet Force. Because most of the Puppet's internal components are semi-mechanical. It has three main cores. One is a high-end technology chip. The other is a chip that can store a huge amount of spiritual power. The third is simulated nerve blood vessels kneaded from psychic clay through modern technology.</p>

    <p>The simulated composition of the puppet's blood vessels and nerves will directly determine the puppet's strength. The more detailed it is, the higher the level of monks it can reproduce.</p>

    <p>But the puppet has a fatal flaw. That is, at least 70% of the body is made of psychic clay. And the shock wave emitted by this railgun can instantly make the clay extremely unstable as soon as it touches the psychic clay. The clay turns into a liquid state. Thus disintegrating directly.</p>

    <p>Although it is harmless to the human body, after all, this is a missile triggered by Emperor's order. No matter how you explain it, this behavior is no different from declaring war.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Mixiu's Emperor's head was full of millet: "You... why didn't you stop me! Do you want to rebel?"</p>

    <p>He was furious. At the same time, he was thinking about the consequences.</p>

    <p>No matter what the outcome of the current situation is, he seems to be embarrassed.</p>

    <p>If this railgun hits, it will directly disintegrate these mechanical monks. This means that Huaxiu does not currently have the kind of fully mechanized monk technology. It can test the opponent's current technological strength. At least it is not as strong as they imagined, right?</p>

    <p>But if it doesn't disintegrate after hitting it... that would be embarrassing. I'm afraid they have really hit a brick wall now.</p>

    <p>However, what no one expected was that there was a third situation.</p>

    <p>They saw that just when the intercontinental railgun was halfway fired, a sword energy came across from a long distance...</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, Yi Jianchuan took action again.</p>

    <p>However, this sword energy was not designed to disintegrate the missile. Instead, it was like a ball of cotton. A giant trampoline was constructed in front of it, causing the railgun to bounce straight in mid-air. It turned around and headed towards Mixiu Country...</p>
