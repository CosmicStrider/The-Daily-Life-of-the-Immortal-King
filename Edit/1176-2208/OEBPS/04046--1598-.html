  <h1>Chapter 1598: People with the same disease</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Fenmu Shen carved the fiftieth character of "æ­£<sup>1</sup>" in his spiritual world.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Zheng" Positive, correct, upright...)</dfn>

    <p>He has had his heart ripped out fifty times by Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen doesn't know what happened to him. Why he failed fifty times in a row. And every time his heart was ripped out by Wang Ling from the countless timelines he controlled.</p>

    <p>When the 51st time. When those horrible dead eyes appeared in front of Fenmu Shen again. He had already developed a psychological shadow.</p>

    <p>Even before Wang Ling could take out his Heart of the Outer God, he directly activated his ability to backtrack.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen roared at Wang Ling: "I am Sotos, the supreme outer god who controls space and time! Don't even think about destroying me like this!" He faced Wang Ling and adjusted time forward again.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As long as your heart is not ripped out by him, it doesn't count as death.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally understands this point.</p>

    <p>But to be honest. In fact, no matter how Fenmu Shen escapes, this ending is already doomed and cannot be changed.</p>

    <p>This is an ability even more terrifying than a seal. It traps people in infinite death and reincarnation. It makes them face the same kind of death consequences over and over again...</p>

    <p>In a sense. Wang Ling feels that Fenmu Shen's ending is even more miserable than Bai Zhe's.</p>

    <p>Although Bai Zhe was eliminated by him from all world lines, there is no longer a character named Bai Zhe in the universe.</p>

    <p>But at least Bai Zhe left happily. At least he didn't have to endure this inescapable pain.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen. No matter what he does now, the outcome is already doomed.</p>

    <p>The reason why this method was adopted was actually carefully considered by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>1: Fenmu Shen has inherited the bloodline of the Outer God. This ancient cosmic creature has many strange methods of resurrection. Wang Ling is worried that if it is killed, it will evolve towards the third form or even the fourth form. It seems a bit endless.</p>

    <p>2: Who asked Fenmu Shen to hit Wang Nuan... This ball of annihilation burned off several of his sister's hairs.</p>

    <p>This account must be settled.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Reverting to Wang Ling's side of the correct world and time line. Fenmu Shen has disappeared. The reason for this is that Fenmu Shen used his ability to go back in time. He has returned his time line to the past.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling does share the ability to control the time.</p>

    <p>So here's the situation. Fenmu Shen is trapped in his old timeline. And he can't get out. Because if he does, it will mean that his Elder God's Heart will be crushed by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling's time. It's still moving forward.</p>

    <p>Wrapped in Corpse Map. No one could have imagined the battle between Wang Ling and Fenmu Shen. The final outcome was so simple and clean.</p>

    <p>Many ancient experts, including Zhang Zhui and Li Xian, believed from the beginning that this was a pinnacle battle destined to go down in history.</p>

    <p>But no one thought that when Wang Ling became serious, Fenmu Shen, who had evolved into an outer god, would still end up being killed instantly...</p>

    <p>And with Fenmu Shen trapped in the old time.</p>

    <p>This Cosmic Embryo, wrapped in a three-petal Golden Lotus, fell into the hands of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reached out and took the bud of Cosmic Embryo into his hand. Ah Nuan saw the situation and couldn't help sucking her fingers. She knew that the bud was extremely important to Wang Ling. Otherwise, she would have eaten the bud too. impulsive.</p>

    <p>In the end, the little girl just stretched out her finger and poked the bud lightly.</p>

    <p>Then there was a "buzz" sound!</p>

    <p>Cosmic Embryo burst out with bright light. Wang Ling frowned slightly. He found that Cosmic Embryo was absorbing the excess energy from Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>This little girl ate too many Tentacles of Divine Punishment, causing her current size to double. But now she has regained control and balance under the absorption of Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>Finally, Ah Nuan girl returned to her original size and lay on Wang Ling's shoulders again. Then she yawned. With a "pop" sound, she turned into a ball of smoke and disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Have you returned to your true body..." Wang Ling thought to himself. The expression on his face seemed to be a smile but not a smile.</p>

    <p>"After all, she's only just been born. You must be tired after all these battles. I'm sure you're tired." Zhang Zhui couldn't help but sigh. He looked at Wang Nuan's cute face. His heart was also filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>He should have had more daughters. Daughters are cute. And they're from Huaxiu Merchants Bank.</p>

    <p>Giving birth to a son... is of no use at all! It was because he had to raise so many sons... that he embarked on this road of no return.</p>

    <p>But after being trapped in the Corpse Map, what Zhang Zhui regretted the most and what made him feel the most sorry was his family members.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if his children who have not yet grown up will survive after he is trapped in this picture...</p>

    <p>This is what Zhang Zhui wants to know most.</p>

    <p>With Dao Ancestor Wang's personality, he wouldn't do anything to his family members.</p>

    <p>Every injustice has its owner, and every debt has its owner. Dao Ancestor Wang would not be so decisive.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian stared at the Cosmic Embryo in Wang Ling's hand and said, "I didn't expect that Cosmic Embryo really exists..."</p>

    <p>These words brought back Zhang Zhui's thoughts: "To make Cosmic Embryo bloom, I'm afraid it requires a huge amount of energy. And this Cosmic Embryo is obviously frightened. Its buds are too tight. It still needs to be given some time. It'll be better to get used to it."</p>

    <p>Listening to the two people's analysis. Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He followed what Zhang Zhui said and used a method of injecting energy bit by bit instead of all at once.</p>

    <p>Such huge energy Wang Ling does exist.</p>

    <p>But for the cosmic bud, energy is more like a fertilizer or nutrient solution. If too much is poured into it, it won't work.</p>

    <p>So he had no choice but to be patient and wait until the buds opened to see what this Cosmic Embryo was.</p>

    <p>Sun Island. Wang Ling's thoughts are withdrawn.</p>

    <p>Here, the closed-door competition surrounding the rankings of college students continues...</p>

    <p>No outsider could imagine this. This Number 60 High School mascot is sitting in the lounge. He seems to be in a daze and suddenly wakes up from his daze. He has just saved the universe again...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Old Timeline. Fenmu Shen looked at the demonic boy in front of him. He couldn't help roaring: "You... you can't. Try another method! Can you stop digging out your heart!"</p>

    <p>It glared angrily and cursed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say a word, but the black tiger dug out his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen still hasn't figured out what happened. Mainly because he doesn't have the guts to think about it.</p>

    <p>As a god who controls time and space, he thinks he controls everything. After all, Wang Ling is just an ordinary earthling. No matter how powerful he is, he will never be able to surpass him in these two abilities.</p>

    <p>But the repeated endings and repeated deaths in front of him told Fenmu Shen this shocking fact that he had to believe...</p>

    <p>He was actually killed once by Wang Ling in all timelines and world lines???</p>

    <p>How is this possible...</p>
