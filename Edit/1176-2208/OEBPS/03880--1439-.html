  <h1>Chapter 1439 The seal is lifted</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Taking advantage of the cover of ancient stones, Peng Xiren quickly retreated.</p>

    <p>He was severely affected by the radiation from the ancient stone. His face turned pale and he felt like he had kidney pain.</p>

    <p>While holding the ancient stone, billions of cells were dying every second in his body...just like those paper towels he used, which exuded a peculiar smell and were thrown into the trash can.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stopped chasing after him. Anyway, he had no intention of killing Peng Xiren from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Originally, this chase was just to dispel Peng Xiren's concerns about the Rubik's Cube. But unexpectedly, he got a new surprise.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that he would have such a magical object on his body. But what exactly is this thing? Even the poor monk doesn't know. Nine times out of ten, it is something from the infinite galaxy." Monk Jin Deng said with emotion.</p>

    <p>Judging from Peng Xiren's experience of pretending to be dead for many years, Peng Xiren has actually been hiding in the infinite galaxy. He knows the terrain there much better than the monk.</p>

    <p>And this magical ancient stone that exudes black light was probably discovered by Peng Xiren in the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>That circle of black light couldn't penetrate even the King's Eyes. Naturally, the monk's swastika eyes couldn't see through either.</p>

    <p>However, the infinite galaxy is too big.</p>

    <p>Even if it is Wang Ling. Without knowing anything about this ancient stone, it may not be easy to pinpoint the source of the ancient stone.</p>

    <p>So. Peng Xiren must live.</p>

    <p>This may be the only person who currently knows the whereabouts of the ancient stone.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Deep in the infinite galaxy. In a planet shrouded in darkness. Peng Xiren's face was pale. He arrived here in extremely embarrassed condition.</p>

    <p>Those evil eyes hidden in the darkness suddenly opened their eyes the moment they sensed Peng Xiren's aura: "Are you injured?"</p>

    <p>Because the battle was too far away, the owner of the evil eye did not see what actually happened.</p>

    <p>But Peng Xiren was injured. It still shocked him slightly.</p>

    <p>Because this is different from the result he expected.</p>

    <p>When he saw Peng Xiren again, he clearly felt that Peng Xiren was much older. This was a sign of aging caused by the death of too many cells.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I can use the power of starlight to heal myself."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren took a few breaths. His whole body was shrouded in starlight. The azure aura penetrated his body through his pores, repairing the damaged cells in his body.</p>

    <p>That's because the ancient stone's wrinkled skin gradually regained its youthful luster.</p>

    <p>"It seems you used the power of that ancient stone..."</p>

    <p>"I underestimated the opponent's fighting strength. It's stronger than I thought. If I could have made sufficient preparations, maybe the outcome would have been different." Peng Xiren coughed twice.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, his injuries were not caused by Wang Ling. They were caused by the backlash effect of this magical ancient stone.</p>

    <p>It was just something he got accidentally. Even he himself didn't understand the origin of this ancient stone. As a result, it unexpectedly saved his life at a critical moment.</p>

    <p>The owner of the evil eye was silent: "This ancient stone, you'd better not use it lightly. Otherwise, there is a risk of your realm regressing."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren nodded: "But this time the operation went smoothly. I brought back the Rubik's Cube on the earth successfully. I just don't know what happened to the attack on the Sword King Realm."</p>

    <p>The original attack from the Sword King Realm was actually a feint attack. Their real purpose was to come for the ninth Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>"As you said, the opponent's combat power is indeed stronger than we imagined. The peach wood sword from the Sword King Realm is not easy to deal with. He also accepted Leng Ming as his disciple. To get this piece Sacrifice. I'm afraid I need to wait until I am unblocked before I can make arrangements for it." The evil eye master snorted.</p>

    <p>"To unlock the seal here, we need to collect at least five old Rubik's Cubes. Now, the Rubik's Cubes have been assembled." Peng Xiren raised his hand. He presented the last Rubik's Cube he just got from the earth.</p>

    <p>Then, the golden Rubik's Cube quickly submerged into the dark planet in front of him.</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>The evil eye master nodded.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, a confused voice came from the owner of the evil eye: "That's not right."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Peng Xiren wondered.</p>

    <p>"This is not the old Rubik's Cube." said the evil eye master.</p>

    <p>"Doesn't it look better maintained?" Peng Xiren was shocked.</p>

    <p>If this is not the old Rubik's Cube...then where did this Rubik's Cube come from?</p>

    <p>"Definitely not." The evil eye master said: "I have been dealing with this Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube for more than a day or two. I know the making process of the old Rubik's Cube very well. I can be sure that it is not an internal smell. This Rubik's Cube is a newly created one. It seems that someone has made a new batch of Rubik's cubes."</p>

    <p>"Newly created..."</p>

    <p>"You think about it. Now there are exactly nine Rubik's Cubes in their hands and in our hands. If all nine Rubik's Cubes are taken away... the chaos of the universe will inevitably riot. However, such a riot did not happen. So. The other party must have secretly replaced all these Rubik's cubes with new ones."</p>

    <p>The owner of the evil eye said: "From the beginning, their purpose was not to snatch the Rubik's Cube. It was to replace it with a new one."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was shocked.</p>

    <p>How could so many new Rubik's cubes be created in such a short period of time?</p>

    <p>This Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. It's not plasticine!</p>

    <p>Evil Eye Master: "If this ninth Rubik's Cube is new, then it means that the old one is already in their hands."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren: "But if this is the case... then we still lose one."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. This doesn't prevent me from coming out."</p>

    <p>The evil eye master chuckled and said: "Although I don't know what method the other party used to create these new Rubik's Cubes. But what is certain is that the seal Dao Ancestor had on me has been loosened. Although these new Rubik's Cubes can be used to create To replace the old Rubik's Cube. It has the effect of stabilizing chaos. However, there are no restrictions deliberately set by Dao Ancestor..."</p>

    <p>"you mean?"</p>

    <p>"The opponent made a miscalculation. Moreover, the spiritual energy stored in the new Rubik's Cube is stronger than that of the old Rubik's Cube. Originally, I needed the power of at least five old Rubik's Cubes to loosen the seal. But now... I only need to add this Swallow a new Rubik's Cube. That's it."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. After Wang Ling returned to the Sword King Realm, the invasion of the Chaos Facehuggers has basically been resolved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying, Jingbai is well organized. Sweeping away all the invading creatures.</p>

    <p>Inside the inn. Wang Ling released Sun Rong from the core world.</p>

    <p>He felt that Sun Rong's face looked a little red. He didn't know what the girl saw in her inner world.</p>

    <p>His core world has not been built yet. There is only an old Number 60 High School that looks like an isolated island. Wang Ling feels that there is really nothing to see.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong mustered up the courage and took the initiative to stop Wang Ling. He stepped forward and held Wang Ling's shoulders, preventing Wang Ling from moving at will: "This weekend! Don't go to the ancient streets with me!"</p>
