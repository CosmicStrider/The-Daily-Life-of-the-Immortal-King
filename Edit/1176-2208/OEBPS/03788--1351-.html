  <h1>Chapter 1351 Sun Rong Apprenticeship</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Liu Qingyi left the venue as if running away.</p>

    <p>She never expected that things would turn out like this.</p>

    <p>The "Sweet and Sour Carp Plan" failed.</p>

    <p>And I lost such a big face in front of Wang Zhen...</p>

    <p>The woman feels ashamed and angry.</p>

    <p>After leaving the venue, she immediately stepped on her flying sword and galloped towards the seaside.</p>

    <p>Now Liu Qingyi feels that she needs to find a place to calm down.</p>

    <p>The earth is not the domain of gods. There is no sea of gods.</p>

    <p>The coast of Songhai City is barely a passable place.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was worried. He quickly took out his spiritual sword and caught up with him, tracking Liu Qingyi's aura.</p>

    <p>His flying speed was so fast that he attracted the traffic police patrolling the air midway.</p>

    <p>"Comrade in front, please stop. You are speeding!" The police uncle also followed Wang Zhen with his sword.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Zhen's speed is too fast...</p>

    <p>He couldn't trace it at all.</p>

    <p>In the end, I had to take a photo of Wang Zhen. Use big data to retrieve information.</p>

    <p>After finding out that Wang Zhen was a student of Number 60 High School, the policeman showed a puzzled expression.</p>

    <p>Can the speed of the swordsmanship in the Foundation Building period be so fast these days?</p>

    <p>It's too dangerous!</p>

    <p>However, considering that Wang Zhen was a student, the air traffic police did not issue a huge ticket in the end. Instead, he issued a warning letter to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>After Number 60 High School resumes classes next Monday, criticism and education against Wang Zhen will definitely be inevitable.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi came to the beach. Before she could calm down.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, a familiar voice came from far away: "Qingyi!"</p>

    <p>It's Wang Zhen's voice...</p>

    <p>Is this guy here to see his own joke?</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi bit her lip and immediately prepared to enter the sea.</p>

    <p>As an opponent, the woman didn't want Wang Zhen to see her joke.</p>

    <p>From a distance, Wang Zhen saw Liu Qingyi preparing to go into the sea. His hair stood up nervously: "Qingyi! No!"</p>

    <p>He didn't have time to think too much. He speeded up a little more.</p>

    <p>When the results arrived, Wang Zhen discovered a serious problem...</p>

    <p>He can't stop!</p>

    <p>Then, a muffled sound came!</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi felt a figure hit her spine at an extremely fast speed.</p>

    <p>He actually took her and formed a ball together. They were entangled together and began to roll forward at a very fast speed.</p>

    <p>Iubiubiu</p>

    <p>Because the angle of Wang Zhen's cut was too tricky. After he and Liu Qingyi collided, the two of them hit the water directly on the sea. After splashing countless ripples, there was a "pop" and they sank together. Into the sea water.</p>

    <p>After getting out of the water, Wang Zhen brought Liu Qingyi back to the coast in a princess hug.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen put Liu Qingyi down. Liu Qingyi felt a pain in her back...</p>

    <p>Tingling: "Hey...slow down!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! I'm sorry. Does it hurt?" Wang Zhen was really distressed.</p>

    <p>"You idiot! You're so frizzy..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi wanted to blame her, but when she saw Wang Zhen's worried eyes, her voice gradually faded out.</p>

    <p>"I thought you were going to commit suicide."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen touched the back of his head. The expression on his face was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"Who would commit suicide for such a thing? And this is not the Sea of Gods. Can the sea water of the earth drown us cultivators in the God's Realm?" Liu Qingyi couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>"What do you call this kind of thing? Isn't Gu Shunzhi your boyfriend? He has two different things. He hurts you!" Wang Zhen said with an angry expression on his face: "Don't worry. I will beat him when I get back. A meal!"</p>

    <p>"Beat him? He is a person of order. You beat him on the head?" Liu Qingyi did not reveal the truth directly. She saw Wang Zhen's interesting reaction and followed his words almost subconsciously and asked.</p>

    <p>"Then I will beg Ling Zhenren! There is always a way to deal with the scumbag! Even if it means kneeling down to Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>I also want him to help me!" Wang Zhen said seriously. It is said that a man has gold at his knees.</p>

    <p>If he had not been trapped on Earth, with Wang Zhen's temper, he would never have knelt down to anyone.</p>

    <p>Now, Wang Zhen's temper has indeed changed a lot. He has become more humble.</p>

    <p>And the person kneeling is Ling Zhenren. This is nothing to shudder at.</p>

    <p>"Pfft! Are you... worried about me?"</p>

    <p>She thought Wang Zhen was really here to laugh at her. But she didn't expect that this fool was really worried about her.</p>

    <p>"I just can't stand it. You are in two different situations! Why aren't you angry at all?" Wang Zhen said stubbornly.</p>

    <p>"Because. Gu Shunzhi was originally invited by me to act."</p>

    <p>At this point, Liu Qingyi finally told the truth: "Actually, those words and that slap were not my original intention. I seemed to be a little out of control at that time. It was like I was possessed by an evil spirit."</p>

    <p>"So the reason you ran away is..."</p>

    <p>"Idiot! I thought you came here to see my joke." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>She stretched out her hand and hugged Wang Zhen's neck. She pulled Wang Zhen's face down a little.</p>

    <p>At this time, the clothes on his body were soaked by the sea water. There was still sand stuck to his body.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the scenery was beautiful.</p>

    <p>Even under the sound of waves crashing on the shore, Wang Zhen could still clearly hear his own heartbeat.</p>

    <p>This unsettling and throbbing feeling made both of them fall into a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Zhen held Liu Qingyi's cheek and kissed her fiercely.</p>

    <p>Everything is unspeakable...</p>

    <p>Far away.</p>

    <p>When Gu Shunzhi saw this scene, he felt that the situation was over.</p>

    <p>These two are getting along...</p>

    <p>Then he will probably cease to exist.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi had even made the worst-case scenario of disappearing.</p>

    <p>But it's strange.</p>

    <p>His body did not disappear.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was convinced that he had not mistaken his mother.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi in front of me. Absolutely...</p>

    <p>That's right, she is his real mother...</p>

    <p>So. What is going on now?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi frowned.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid there's no one who can give him the answer now.</p>

    <p>There is only Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen took Liu Qingyi to the lying hospital.</p>

    <p>He confirmed that the impact he had just had had no impact on Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>The two then returned to the cadre's apartment.</p>

    <p>In the elevator, the two of them intertwined their fingers.</p>

    <p>"I just said it's okay. This little impact can't hurt me."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi said: "Look. Is the money wasted in vain? Are you feeling distressed?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not that stingy. There's no harm in checking it out anyway. At least I know how your body can handle it."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen smiled and said softly: "Maybe in the future, the impact will be even more violent..."</p>

    <p>"You are such an adult. You are not serious at all!" Liu Qingyi blushed.</p>

    <p>You know. Wang Zhen has been issued a speeding warning ticket today!</p>

    <p>Bite!</p>

    <p>At this time, the elevator door slowly opened. Liu Qingyi saw many employees wearing Huaguo Shuilian Group uniforms, who were moving things into the room under the guidance of an old aunt.</p>

    <p>"Did you shop online?" Wang Zhen was confused.</p>

    <p>"No...I didn't buy it..." Liu Qingyi shook her head.</p>

    <p>At this time, the old aunt who was directing the scene came over and bowed to Liu Qingyi with a smile: "Hello, Miss Liu. I am the head maid under Miss Sun Rong. Everyone else calls her Qiu Shuyun. My Aunt Qiu."</p>

    <p>"Hello Aunt Qiu!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi nodded: "So what is going on now?"</p>

    <p>"This is the apprenticeship ceremony that Miss Sun Rong ordered us to send." Aunt Qiu said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Apprenticeship ceremony..." Liu Qingyi was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun Rong already knew everything on the phone. She also said that Master Liu has a lot of tricks. There are so many things worth learning from her."</p>

    <p>"From now on, our young lady's happiness will depend more on Master Liu!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
