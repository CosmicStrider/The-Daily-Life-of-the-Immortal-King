  <h1>Chapter 2201 Abandoned Factory</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lao Huang led Wang Ling, Sun Rong to an abandoned factory in the suburbs. Various Wolong and Fengchu gathered here.</p>

    <p>Pushing the half-open rusty door a little deeper, there was a harsh sound. Wang Ling put his trouser pockets in his pocket. He followed Lao Huang and Sun Rong into the factory. Li.</p>

    <p>He deliberately changed into a sweatshirt before entering the door, put on a hood and a mask, and covered himself tightly.</p>

    <p>The original purpose of the gathering of ability users was to share intelligence. But in fact, in addition to sharing intelligence, the people who came here also wanted to collect more information about competitors.</p>

    <p>Before many people gathered, they had heard that there was a painter who majored in the unpopular traditional bow major in college. He would lead two high school students who were engaged in outdoor training to complete this competition task. Most of them had the mentality of watching the fun.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling and Sun Rong arrived, many people couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>

    <p>"I thought I received fake news. I didn't expect that there was actually a brother who brought two oil bottles to compete with the big guys." A monk sitting on an empty oil drum shouted. There was a burst of noise around him. The sound of laughter.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm in his heart. He tilted his neck. He had heard a lot of such ridicule since he was a child. He had long been used to it.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Rong, during the days she was practicing at Number 60 High School, she gradually regained her temper as a young lady in the past and became much calmer.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, according to Sun Rong's previous temper, these people would probably be dragged to Shenjiang.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calmly observed the surroundings. He found that the so-called ability users in this factory were not all brainless. There were some calm people among them who were secretly watching their actions.</p>

    <p>"Cough--" Amidst the laughter, a light suddenly shone down from above the factory. Along with a slender man, the voices of the people around him suddenly fell silent.</p>

    <p>Although this man has a thin body, he is full of energy. Just a slight cough is like a thunderous explosion. The breath of an endless powerful man rolls in. The spiritual pressure is so strong that it is difficult for those around him to breathe.</p>

    <p>"Everyone has made progress little by little from the bottom of the cultivator. There is no need to laugh at these juniors in the world of cultivation. They have the heart to join the training. As seniors, we should encourage them." He walked around and spoke. The fingers with distinct phalanges are adorned with various gemstones. The slender fingers are a blessing for hand control.</p>

    <p>Everyone around them looked in awe. No one dared to speak out to refute.</p>

    <p>You know it. This person has a transcendent status among this group of capable people. He is a highly respected person.</p>

    <p>It was not that Lao Huang had not done any investigation on this person. He whispered to Wang Ling and Sun Rong: "This is the leader of the ability user group Number 1. Huang Tingjian."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put his trouser pockets in. He glanced at the average strength of the ability users around him. The lowest level is at the early stage of Nascent Soul. The average level is at the early stage of Soul Formation. The person with the highest level is the name standing at the top. The group leader named Huang Tingjian.</p>

    <p>The realm of this leader of the Yellow Group is at the peak of the ninth level of Itinerant Immortal. He is only a little short of being able to leap into the realm of True Immortal. Among the standards of ordinary monks, his talent is already very high.</p>

    <p>Of course. Compared with the many geniuses Wang Ling has seen, Huang Tingjian's talent is very average.</p>

    <p>"I know. Everyone who was invited to gather here today must have come here for the purpose of exchanging information. But this information, true or false, is too confusing. Is this melon kept cooked or not? It still needs to be done. You can judge for yourself."</p>

    <p>Huang Tingjian showed off the gems in his hand and said, "But I have some intelligence information here. And this information has not been opened so far. It was written by... Zhi Jiunian."</p>

    <p>Wisdom lasts a long time?</p>

    <p>Hearing this name, there was an uproar at the scene.</p>

    <p>Because this is the name of the leader of another group of ability users. And it has a resounding name and status among these countless ability users.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can be seen. The leaders of these groups of ability users are more about building a bridge for transporting ability users for this infinite group in the universe.</p>

    <p>I had no interest in directly joining the company as a worker. Being able to recruit such talents just proves that these group owners have secrets that may interest Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As for other ability users, Wang Ling feels that they can be completely ignored.</p>

    <p>Although they are said to be capable people, most of them rely on their own abilities and have the cultivation level of a mid-to-high-end talented monk. Their own cultivation talents are often poor.</p>

    <p>After looking at these people Wang Ling, I feel that there is no need to understand them at all.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, it is these group leaders who gather the ability users...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that these talents are the focus.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, the leaders of these groups of capable people are intermediaries.</p>

    <p>To put it mildly, it's headhunting.</p>

    <p>They are specifically responsible for discovering these capable people who have high self-esteem. Then they will be refined through various screenings. Finally, they will introduce the real talents into the designated companies. At that time, the task will be completed.</p>

    <p>And they will also receive more generous commissions and various rewards than these ability users in return.</p>

    <p>"So. The real interview question is not about catching the aliens who are smuggling. It is about starting from various intermediate links." After Wang Ling's analysis, Sun Rong also came to think of it. Come on.</p>

    <p>There are talent interview routines here. As the future corporate successor of Huaguo Shuilian Group, Sun Rong has been exposed to some of them more or less.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Huang Tingjian was holding a scroll: "You must have heard of Master Zhi's name. This information was provided by Master Zhi. The credibility is very high. Who can get this information." There is a probability of more than 80% that we can complete the mission issued by the company and successfully become a member of the infinite universe. But to get this information, you need to show some skills."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he tied a chain to the scroll and hung it high above the abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, the scroll is right here. Whoever can touch the scroll first, the information inside will belong to him." Huang Tingjian laughed condescendingly. His voice echoed throughout the abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>And in the next second, the eyes of almost all ability users in the entire abandoned factory were focused on the scroll hanging upside down by chains on the top floor of the abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. This battle is about to break out.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he put his hands in his pockets and slowly walked forward. The wind whistled rhythmically along with Wang Ling's pace. It was like bagpipes coming from afar. At this time, it was like slaps of slaps. On everyone's cheek...</p>
