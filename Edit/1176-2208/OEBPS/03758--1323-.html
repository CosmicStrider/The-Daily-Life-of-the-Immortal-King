  <h1>Chapter 1323 Heavenly Dao who was taken to death in a ditch</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is less than an hour until Earth's Tribulation Transcendence.</p>

    <p>Dead Bone Desert. Huaxiu Alliance, Office of Strategic Deception sent guards and sect disciples to patrol along the edge of the desert. High-altitude restrictions were set up to prevent cultivators from crossing the desert from the air.</p>

    <p>"Attention all units. All patrols will be evacuated in half an hour. Arrive at a safe area a thousand miles away as quickly as possible. Do not stay nearby." Lord Diulei looked up at the sky and used collective sound transmission to give commands.</p>

    <p>The impact of the power of chaos is extremely destructive. Even the power of radiation is not something that ordinary cultivators can withstand.</p>

    <p>Therefore, before the Tribulation Transcendence, except for the core members, all other patrol personnel must complete the evacuation.</p>

    <p>"So nervous! Really nervous!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei rubbed his hands.</p>

    <p>This time, the command of the upgrade of Earth's Tribulation Transcendence. The Huaxiu Alliance has been given full power in his hands.</p>

    <p>The stakes are high. Lord Diulei does not want to let the Head of State down.</p>

    <p>Whether their Office of Strategic Deception can gain a pivotal position in the international cultivation circle depends on this wave!</p>

    <p>"It's strange. Why can the Head of State approve the upgrade of the earth so quickly this time?" At this time, Er Ha suddenly said.</p>

    <p>On the side. Xiao Yin replied: "I heard from Diulei. In fact, various countries have long had the idea of upgrading the earth. But they have never found a way. Now Heavenly Dao comes to help. Naturally, I agreed."</p>

    <p>"Huh? Why is Brother Dog here too?" Lord Diulei asked, looking at this familiar emerald figure.</p>

    <p>"I will become a holy beast soon. But there is still a big gap between the holy beast and the divine beast. Watching the divine beast break its shell up close. This should be an excellent opportunity." Er Ha replied.</p>

    <p>"Can a sacred beast evolve in the direction of a divine beast?" Lord Diulei was startled.</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, it's possible. It's just a matter of physical fitness. If a spiritual beast wants to evolve into a holy beast, it must learn to refine the original energy, integrate the original energy into the blood, and finally convert the blood in the body into the blood of the holy beast. In this way Evolution will be completed."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng nodded: "And if a holy beast wants to evolve into a divine beast, it is essentially the same. It requires sufficient physical fitness to accept the power of chaos. However, this is an extremely difficult thing to do."</p>

    <p>"Can't the Rakshasa King do the same?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about Rakshasa King, the King of Holy Beasts? If he reaches the level of King of Holy Beasts, maybe he can give it a try. But since the Holy Beast incident, the poor monk remembers that King Rakshasa's spirit is getting weaker and weaker. He doesn't want to make progress, and his physical fitness is not as good as before. If you try to fuse the power of chaos, you will most likely die..." the monk reasoned.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone was surprised.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. The underground retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception. Zhuo Yi is introducing the other core members of the Office of Strategic Deception to the girl.</p>

    <p>The few who stayed to guard the mountain gate. Sun Rong have completely gotten to know each other. The remaining core members are now concentrated in the Desert of Dead Bones.</p>

    <p>The picture on the screen includes everyone. This makes it much easier to identify Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Did you see that silver-haired one with bare feet? His name is Xiao Yin. He is a holy beast. He was taken in by Master a long time ago. And he has always been attached to Master." Zhuo Yi introduced while observing. The girl's reaction.</p>

    <p>However, the girl's reaction seemed calmer than Zhuo Yi imagined: "Do you like to stick to your classmate Wang Ling? It's actually normal. Classmate Wang Ling has always been very popular!" Ah, by the way. Where does Miss Xiao Yin live?"</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong What do you want to do?"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. Just sending some gifts and saying hello. Thank you, Miss Xiao Yin, for taking care of your classmate Wang Ling!" Although at this time, the girl still maintained a generous and decent smile on her face. But her tone Something is obviously not right here.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels that if this matter is not explained clearly, it may cause a big fuss!</p>

    <p>This is not asking for your address to send gifts...</p>

    <p>It looks like he obviously wants to send the blade!</p>

    <p>So at this time, Zhuo Yi coughed slightly: "Ahem... Sun Rong school girl. Actually Xiao Yin is a boy."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, there was a brief silence in the retreat room.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, the girl's expression improved significantly. She covered her mouth and looked a little surprised: "So beautiful... she is actually a boy..."</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin has indeed been mistaken for a girl. When we went to the Wang family's villa before, even my grandmother admitted her mistake." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I always thought it was a girl just now."</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey. Sun Rong junior classmate, do you feel a sense of relief?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong found.</p>

    <p>My senior's tricks are now getting deeper and deeper.</p>

    <p>And it can be described as hard to guard against.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Young people nowadays."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao also sighed at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Why does the senior's voice sound so resentful?" Zhuo Yi couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"I just think that these days, gender does not explain everything. I think that if you like someone, you should take the initiative in time. You know, the population of male cultivators in Huaxiu country exceeds the number of female cultivators. So these days, and female cultivators The person who robs the Taoist companion is not necessarily a female cultivator. It may also be a male cultivator."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Senior... I feel like you are hinting at something."</p>

    <p>"Is there any?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao was completely unconscious.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I think you may have been tricked by me. Hehehehe."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "?"</p>

    <p>I have to say. Heavenly Dao is an honest man. He actually doesn't have any other bad intentions. He was just led into a trap by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He said a lot of things along the lines of Zhuo Yi's point of view. He had no other ideas. However, Zhuo Yi's rhythmic ability was too strong. He didn't even think of the death of Heavenly Dao himself. After saying this, the girl in the Golden Lotus will blush.</p>

    <p>As a rhythm master. Zhuo Yi's initial goal has been achieved.</p>

    <p>Even Heavenly Dao can be brought into the ditch invisibly by him. I'm afraid more and more people will fall in in the future...</p>

    <p>Hey hey hey!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling paid close attention to the movements in the field.</p>

    <p>He asked Lord Ma to call Er Ha here. In fact, he had another purpose.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha was teleported here, Heavenly Dao was the only one left in the Wang family's villa, painting Talisman in loneliness and coldness...</p>

    <p>"Have you felt it too?" At this time, Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>"Not bad." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>It can feel that there is a very powerful soul floating in the nearby space.</p>

    <p>That's right. This soul is not another...</p>

    <p>It's that stupid prairie dog.</p>

    <p>This guy has not been resurrected from the place where God forsaken him.</p>

    <p>Instead, he deliberately kept himself in the state of his soul body.</p>

    <p>The purpose is already obvious.</p>

    <p>He wanted to seize the body of the larvae of the divine beast at the moment it broke out of its shell!</p>

    <p>"What a stupid groundhog." Er Ha couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>"You have to do this on your own. I won't help you." At this time, Wang Ling said in a message.</p>

    <p>He called Er Ha here. In fact, he was seeking welfare for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>But in this case, for some reason, Wang Ling cannot step in to help.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Little Master Ling. I am determined to win this mere remnant soul..." Er Ha smiled, full of confidence.</p>

    <p>The little clever things this groundhog is doing now are all leftover from his past tricks!</p>
