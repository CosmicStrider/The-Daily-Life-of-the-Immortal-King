  <h1>Chapter 2102 Wall of Spiritual Consciousness</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The confrontation in the restricted area of the sea is still continuing. Mixiu Country's immortal fleet is still surrounding the little white dragon. Since the Oolong incident of the railgun, no one has taken the lead again.</p>

    <p>The Xiu Zhen Kingdom has already intervened in this matter. Yue Ling is in danger, and Zhang Zhui, representing the Office of Strategic Deception, is particularly passive. They can't make the decision. They can only follow Yi Jianchuan's orders.</p>

    <p>This is the founding general and the meritorious minister. At this moment, he fully obeys the command of the sword master. There is absolutely no mistake.</p>

    <p>"Ah, I really want to take action. If I take action directly, I can sink all these immortal swords."</p>

    <p>But Wang Muyu had never seen a scene like the confrontation between the two armies. A large number of mechanical monks faced off against the immortal fleet. This made Wang Muyu, who has the blood of the dragon clan, couldn't help but feel excited.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but want to take action several times, but he forced himself to endure it.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Be confident, Muyu. If you take action, it will not sink you. You are trying to drill a hole in the earth. But now, you still have to be patient. Otherwise, the spirit of the earth will be scolded."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei: "He's right!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei kept privately chatting with Wang Muyu through the method of Wang Ling to comfort him. This was also a good time to exercise patience. Although the little guy is strong, it is indeed as Wang Ling said in terms of mental growth. There is still a long way to go.</p>

    <p>With no one on either side acting rashly, this has become a seemingly peaceful and smokeless war. Everyone is waiting for the opportunity to move, waiting for further instructions from the two Yuan Zuns.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the confrontation between these two giant cultivating countries on the high seas, no other cultivating country dared to intervene like this at this moment.</p>

    <p>The male cultivator has the courage, but for now he is still watching the fire from the other side. It turns out that the male cultivator saw that the little white dragon was surrounded by a group of Mi Xiu's immortal swords. He wanted to directly open a bunch of immortal swords to rescue the siege.</p>

    <p>The result was unimaginable. The large number of mechanical monks in the void really made all the cultivation countries in the world dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>No one knows what exactly happened.</p>

    <p>No one knows why overnight. The pattern of the world of cultivation suddenly changed. The emergence of "ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device" and "pure mechanized monks" directly announced that Huaxiu led all human monks into 2 Level 1 cosmic cultivation civilization stage.</p>

    <p>The shock and silence at the moment are all reflected in this historic moment. However, on the surface, there is a dead silence during the confrontation in the Shanghai restricted area. In fact, there is indeed a turbulent undercurrent behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>"really."</p>

    <p>In the Karma Base, Wang Ming, who was wearing a helmet, suddenly frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>This helmet is a mental power amplification device. In addition to ensuring that Wang Ming can control these ten thousand mechanical monks at the same time, it also allows Wang Ming to achieve insight and surveillance of the entire earth through the satellite network in the universe.</p>

    <p>Countless data images are pouring into the human brain. This was something Wang Ming could never do before integrating the divine brain. The ability to process data in batches is simply not something ordinary humans possess.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming managed to do it on his own.</p>

    <p>In this regard, Shou Chong's heart is also very complicated. He recognizes Wang Ming's excellence. He already possesses such terrifying thinking ability at a young age. Even before merging with the divine brain, he is known as the most powerful brain in mankind and Not even the most cutting-edge scientists can overdo it.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Now that Wang Ming has integrated the divine brain, is he... still a human?</p>

    <p>Shou Chong feels that this issue can only be discussed later. Anyway, from Shou Chong's point of view at the moment, he feels that Wang Ming is so powerful that he is not considered a human being because no normal human monk can achieve this with pure science. The strength is on par with the monks above the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Shou Chong knows very well that Wang Ming has not yet unleashed the full potential of Shen Nao.</p>

    <p>His future is immeasurable.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Shou Chong. What's wrong with Wang Ming?" Seeing Wang Ming looking sad and silent, Zhai Yin was also anxious. She thought Wang Ming was in some trouble.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Shou Chong smiled: "It's okay. I guess Teacher Wang Ming must have seen the wall."</p>

    <p>"Wall? What wall?" Zhai Yin was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Wall of Spiritual Consciousness."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>This is also the usual method used by Michu. By building a wall of spiritual consciousness, it can accurately control the thinking of every monk within the territory.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the reasons why many Michio monks are unreasonable, arrogant and anti-intellectual.</p>

    <p>Because they were deceived. Their minds were blocked by the wall of spiritual consciousness. At the same time, they were forced to instill the perfect story carefully woven by Misu Yuan Zun and his staff.</p>

    <p>Building a wall of spiritual consciousness is also a common tactic used by Michu. This is also the so-called battle of cultivation information.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong felt that Zhai Yin might not understand it well if he just explained it like this. So he turned on his phone.</p>

    <p>The direct login account is connected to a social platform software from Mixiu Country. On this platform, a large number of Mixiu monks who were affected by the Wall of Spiritual Consciousness were deceived.</p>

    <p>They publish all kinds of sensational remarks.</p>

    <p>Such as those mechanical monks in the void. Many Mi Xiu monks began to express their opinions.</p>

    <p>"This mechanical monk is obviously a technology invented by our Mi Xiu! Their Huaxiu monks don't deserve it! This is stealing our scientific research results!"</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel that we, Mi Xiu, have already had this mechanical monk? Why are they copying our patent? I think Brother Huaxiu should reflect on it. And why are they shooting railguns at us? We are being invaded! Everyone must hold the spiritual sword in hand. Fight with them!"</p>

    <p>"Have you seen the screenshots of the restricted sea area? Oh my god! Their mechanical monks actually surrounded our immortal fleet. Please! Please! We don't want a war! [Prayer]"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After reading more than a dozen comments in succession. www.uukanshu.net Zhai Yin felt bad. He fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>She couldn't believe that these people could confuse right and wrong to this extent.</p>

    <p>It was obviously the magnetic cannon fired by Misu Yuan Zun. But now it has become their fault.</p>

    <p>It was obviously the little white dragon surrounded by Michu's immortal fleet. But now, each one of them actually said that they were surrounded.</p>

    <p>This is pure lying with your eyes open. It is basically an act of lying without drafting!</p>

    <p>A troublemaker who has been instigating wars all year round. He actually wants others to reflect... Zhai Yin no longer knows what to say.</p>

    <p>But it is such an outrageous statement. Almost every post on the platform has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of likes.</p>

    <p>"Have you seen it? This is the wall of spiritual consciousness." At this time, Shou Chong sighed.</p>

    <p>In this world, there are always people who are awake. The most ridiculous thing...</p>
