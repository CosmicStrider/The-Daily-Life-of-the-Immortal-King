  <h1>Chapter 1930 The spirit world behind the teahouse door</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jing Heqiu had no idea how Wang Ling succeeded in breaking through the level... He was puzzled by the explanation in his mind, and finally came to a conclusion. That is, Wang Ling's primer technique is very good. Maybe it's not attached to an object, but a person!</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Ling used the "Priming Technique" to send himself over, and predicted that Li Changzhe was going to score with a headbutt, so he sucked himself onto Li Changzhe at the moment Li Changzhe scored!</p>

    <p>That's must be true...</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was surprised. He felt that there seemed to be no other reasonable explanation.</p>

    <p>So the current situation is... Has he already entered?</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu looked at the time. It was now 23:50 in the evening. There was only less than 10 minutes left before the originally agreed time to complete the goal.</p>

    <p>But the door is already broken.</p>

    <p>This first batch of invited students was unable to complete the test. There will definitely be complaints.</p>

    <p>He needs to find a way to coordinate first, and then arrange follow-up opportunities for supplementary testing.</p>

    <p>At least let the remaining people divide the last 10 minutes equally. Complete the supplementary test.</p>

    <p>Now Jing Heqiu cannot contact Mr. Teng in advance. However, the task of sending Wang Ling in has finally been successfully completed. Although Jing Heqiu currently does not know how Wang Ling got in.</p>

    <p>But towards Wang Ling, he always had a contemptuous attitude.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before breaking into the teahouse door, Wang Ling had already noticed with King's Eyes. The passage connected behind the teahouse door was not the teahouse itself. It was a different space.</p>

    <p>It is similar in nature to a kind of joint core world. To put it bluntly, this different space is like a huge hive. Each part of this hive is provided by different people, and ultimately synthesizes a huge space body.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling can feel it. The essence of this United Core World.</p>

    <p>This is a giant space synthesized using modern scientific and technological means. It is a world created through continuous research on the "inherent spiritual realm" combined with modern cultivation technology...</p>

    <p>To put it simply, the world is like a giant puzzle. But it is difficult for one cultivation country to complete the puzzle. So Wang Ling determines that this world is the joint efforts of all cultivation countries.</p>

    <p>Each country provided fragments of the world, and then pieced together such a united world.</p>

    <p>In a sense, this is also a manifestation of the value of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was slightly shocked. He actually did not expect that modern cultivation technology could actually achieve this level.</p>

    <p>Of course. In terms of pure space hardness, the solidity of this artificially synthesized joint core world has not yet reached the standard of a normal core world. Perhaps it is due to the patchwork relationship that causes the structure to be unstable. But such a large world is already shocking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Li Changzhe came in together. But after entering this different space, he felt that Li Changzhe was teleported away. All senses of time and space became blurred here.</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, Wang Ling was already standing in a primitive jungle. Li Changzhe was gone. But he was not too far away from him. If Wang Ling wanted to, he could directly follow his breath and went to meet Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling looked up at the sky. This was a light screen of text.</p>

    <p>The first line reads:</p>

    <p>Welcome to the spirit world.</p>

    <p>The second line is washed:</p>

    <p>Return countdown 23:59:59...</p>

    <p>"The spiritual world?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>This should be the name given to this place by the people who created this world. In fact, its essence is the "core world." But perhaps the highest level of cultivators on earth has not yet reached the stage where they can create a "core world." So it is not possible yet to understand what the "things" they have created using scientific means are.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling laughed in his heart. He felt a little ironic.</p>

    <p>So now he, Li Changzhe, Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan are the first to enter the spirit world. They are still facing this huge primitive jungle. Is it possible that they are required to open up wasteland here? Survive for a day?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this should not be a problem. He has participated in survival games many times. Even without using "luck skills," his natural luck will naturally give him all the advantages.</p>

    <p>At this time, facing the vast primitive jungle in front of him, he seemed a little confused. After arriving in the spirit world, he found that there was an inexplicable circle of dust on his wrist. With a light touch, the dust fell off.</p>

    <p>Closed his eyes. Wang Ling magnified his spiritual awareness. After capturing the positions of Qu Shuling, Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe, Wang Ling decided to go to these three people first.</p>

    <p>He was afraid that someone was watching him, so he didn't dare to use the teleportation technique. He walked over.</p>

    <p>Then in front of a small river, Wang Ling saw the figures of Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan from a long distance away. They found Li Changzhe. However, Li Changzhe was fainted and foaming at the mouth.</p>

    <p>"Why did he faint?" Zhang Linyan frowned and motioned to Qu Shuling to carry Li Changzhe away.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling had a look of disgust on his face, but he didn't complain at all.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Wang Ling was embarrassed to discover that there seemed to be an electronic bracelet on the wrists of these three people...</p>

    <p>That should be something issued by the public. It is used to monitor movement data.</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Ling also had one on him... and it was put on the moment he passed through the gate of Jiutian Tea House.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. This electronic bracelet was too fragile. It failed to withstand the test of Wang Ling. It was scrapped before Wang Ling landed.</p>

    <p>That's why Wang Ling saw a circle of ash on his wrist... That was the "corpse" left behind after the electronic bracelet was destroyed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. He didn't know whether he would have to pay for the damage to the public property. But now he finally knew why Zhang Linyan and Qu Shuling couldn't find him.</p>

    <p>There are too many factors that interfere with spiritual consciousness in this huge primitive jungle. Although the two of them are already very strong among young people, they are still not able to go directly through spiritual consciousness as freely as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this electronic bracelet is actually distributed by the public and is used to confirm positioning.</p>

    <p>Now it is ruined by Wang Ling. This gives Wang Ling a little headache.</p>

    <p>There is no way.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could only follow the example. He casually twisted off a piece of rattan and wrapped it around his wrist. Then he used the King's Eyes magic to create a one-to-one electronic bracelet.</p>

    <p>Because Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan never noticed him. Wang Ling himself was quite embarrassed.</p>

    <p>He followed the two of them, and finally followed them to the camp where they were in the spirit world.</p>

    <p>It was a very simple-looking wooden house. On the top of the wooden house was a flag of Huaxiu majestically planted. It was fluttering in the wind...</p>
