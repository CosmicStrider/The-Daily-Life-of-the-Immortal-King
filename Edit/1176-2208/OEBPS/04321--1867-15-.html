  <h1>Chapter 1867 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It's just a piece of mythical animal hair. It's unprecedented in the entire auction history of the Central Auction House that it can be sold for such a sky-high price.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that this mythical animal hair would be so valuable.</p>

    <p>Although most people have never heard of the name of this mythical beast and don't know its origin. However, the amazing energy emanating from this hair is a fact.</p>

    <p>If it can be refined effectively, not only can it be used to refine elixirs and weapons, but it may also be possible to learn the secrets of the mythical beast itself.</p>

    <p>"If you can understand the secret hidden in the hair... you can definitely reach a higher level!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was in a daze.</p>

    <p>The more these people talk, the more outrageous they become. This is just a piece of his hair. It would be a bit fanciful to try to understand the secret method through this hair.</p>

    <p>People who get this hair will not understand any secrets. They will just have cravings for crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>Of course. Giving this name to this head. Wang Ling actually has a different meaning.</p>

    <p>How much it can be sold for is not that important to Wang Ling. What is important is that he needs to test the reaction of everyone in the audience through this made-up name.</p>

    <p>Those powerful people who pretend to have heard the name of this mythical beast and act generously are definitely not people from the Office of Strategic Deception who have traveled from modern times.</p>

    <p>There has never been a mythical beast called a raccoon in the eons. So if you hear the name and don't join in the fun, you can be included as a suspect of "suspected to be possessed by the soul of the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>So at this time. Wang Ling's eyes were fixed on King Tiankun, who was regarded as the representative of the Western Emperor.</p>

    <p>This person had never participated in the competition from the beginning. Not only did he not directly participate in the bidding, there was not much surprise on his face after hearing this strange name.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, King Tiankun became very suspicious in an instant. He had reason to believe that there might be a friend from the Office of Strategic Deception lurking inside King Tiankun's body.</p>

    <p>But if someone is lurking inside, the acting is too similar. There is no flaw at all.</p>

    <p>"Do you think this King Tiankun is suspicious?" At this time, Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"It's a bit." Wang Zhen nodded: "He was not directly involved, and he had no other weird reactions. In addition, Mrs. Shanxiu of the Immortal Mountain Sect is also very suspicious. These two people have never been together. It's such a big move. He seems very calm."</p>

    <p>"I agree with Brother Wang Zhen. I also think these two people are a bit weird. But I feel that something is wrong." Sun Rong also participated in the discussion. She frowned slightly. She had an intuition. Telling her that things are not as simple as they think.</p>

    <p>Just when everyone here at Wang Ling was secretly guessing, King Tiankun, who had always remained calm, suddenly stood up to everyone's surprise.</p>

    <p>"Three million mixed spirit stones. I want it!" As soon as he said it, it was three million. It was a price that crushed the entire audience.</p>

    <p>No one expected that King Tiankun, who was extremely powerful in the West, would choose to take action at this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that as long as a powerful person like King Tiankun took action, not many people would dare to compete. They were afraid of offending him.</p>

    <p>If it were in a general auction house, it would definitely develop according to the above trend.</p>

    <p>But it's different here. Just like what King Tiankun said at the beginning, the identities of those who can enter the Central Auction House are not simple.</p>

    <p>Now King Tiankun directly participates in the bidding. This has actually inspired more people to be interested in "Wang Ling hair."</p>

    <p>Who is this person?</p>

    <p>King Tiankun!</p>

    <p>He is known as the representative and incarnation of the Western Emperor.</p>

    <p>Even such people participated in the bidding. And as soon as it was exported, the price was shockingly high. This proved the value of this "hair."</p>

    <p>"Sure enough. Just as I guessed. This mythical beast hair is an extraordinary thing! Even King Tiankun has joined the competition!"</p>

    <p>"Everyone, King Tiankun is currently bidding three million mixed spirit stones. Is there any higher price?" At this time, as the auctioneer, Liu Renwen held a small hammer and struck while the iron was hot. He seized the opportunity.</p>

    <p>He used his own words to encourage more people to participate in the bidding and bid a high price: "This is a rare mythical animal hair. Even if you don't know how to use it, just keeping it around can bring good luck... After all, this is a mythical beast. But It is called a mascot!"</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen's words immediately made the eyes of Wang Ling and others in Private Room Number 1 light up.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Seniors... He said... mascot? Did I hear it correctly?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "You heard it right Miss Rong. I heard it too. This Liu Renwen must have guessed our identity. He should be one of our own."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded and agreed with Zhang Zhui's opinion: "This is checking the code with us. After all, not many people know this code name. It can only be one of our own. But we don't know yet. This Liu Renwen's body, who is it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "Wait for a few more rounds and see. There will always be time to reveal your own characteristics."</p>

    <p>Several people were in the middle of a discussion. As a result, Mrs. Shanxiu, the leader of the Immortal Mountain Sect who had been silent all this time, also spoke up and joined the bidding.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu: "I will give you five million mixed spirit stones. Plus a copy of the original sheet music of the Nine-Bend Star Formation."</p>

    <p>Nine-curved star formation. This is a divine formation from the ancient times. It ranks above level 4 of Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang. It is converted according to the level of the modern world of cultivation. The level of this formation is at least 11th level.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that what Mrs. Shanxiu took out was the original formation score. This is the most original and only copy. It has more collection value.</p>

    <p>This is a direct exchange with valuable items. It is also within the scope of the Central Auction House's permission.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu's participation in the photoshoot made the people at the scene even more excited. Now everyone knows that this mythical animal hair is a good thing. They don't want to miss it.</p>

    <p>"I'll give you six million mixed spirit stones. Plus twenty bottles of liquid that misses you!" At this time, a young man with a shaved back said. He was a famous sex toy shop owner in the ancient times.</p>

    <p>The "Miss You" Liquid is the treasure of the store that he developed personally. The advertising slogan is simple and straightforward: "Baby, I'm getting an IV. What liquid? Missing you at night..."</p>

    <p>Although it was once ridiculed as greasy, the effect is indeed genuine.</p>

    <p>As long as you spray it on your body, it will automatically attract true love. Only true love will not dislike this greasiness and be willing to get close.</p>

    <p>"This potion is very famous. It is the key to finding Taoist companions. It is expensive to make. Of course, there are also people who apply it and are cast aside by others while the potion is taking effect. But this usually has to be found in yourself. After using it, not having a wife means that there is no true love for you in this world." Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>As more and more people participated in the bidding, the auction house became more and more lively. Later, no one brought up mixed spiritual stones. They all used the treasures at the bottom of the box to exchange.</p>

    <p>"I will publish two books of divine spiritual skills and one book of divine techniques!"</p>

    <p>"I can exchange it for the complete remains of the ancient dragon!"</p>

    <p>"Haha. You can't do any of this! I'll give you two hundred kilograms of moral integrity!"</p>
