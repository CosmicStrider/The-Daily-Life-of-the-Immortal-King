  <h1>Chapter 1684 The Eternal One</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the resurrection of Master Wu Xin in this way, the master of the Supreme World changes. New cracks are no longer formed. And there is a trend of gradual healing.</p>

    <p>This is the first cultivator in the universe to realize the complete mechanization of himself. All that is left in his body is the rotating ice wheel gears and engine oil. Therefore, no matter where he goes, he always makes no sound. It cannot be detected through normal spiritual perception. its existence.</p>

    <p>At that time, the monk remembered it very clearly. Wu Xin had been squeezed out by the other Eternals. He was called a monster in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But it was this monster. In the end, he escaped the punishment of Dao Ancestor Wang. He used a fake body to deceive Dao Ancestor Wang and kept it secret. He also secretly developed ancient magic weapons and helped Fenmu Shen create a batch of them. So far, there are no The mechanical cultivation coalition forces were completely wiped out.</p>

    <p>"So. Wu Xin... Is it in your plan to come back to life in this way." Monk Jin Deng understood.</p>

    <p>"I wanted to share the joy of success with Nawei. But unfortunately. The development of the science of cultivation. It will eventually come with sacrifice. It's true that I've left something to chance. But..."</p>

    <p>Wu Xin said coldly: "In this form, the borrowed body is resurrected. It was not my intention. That's why I gave Nawei a chance. As long as the brain activation level is below 99%. He can still control his body. Once it passes the threshold. I'll take over."</p>

    <p>He said this. And he said it very sincerely. It didn't seem like he was lying.</p>

    <p>Even now, there is no reason to continue lying.</p>

    <p>The power of the divine brain is very strong. Monk Jin Deng knows this very well. Once it reaches 100% activation level, it can even distort reality and create a new world.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as long as the mind is not destroyed. Theoretically, the mindless is the state of immortality.</p>

    <p>And all he needs to do is hide his divine brain.</p>

    <p>The Zhou Ziyi bullet just hit Nawei's head pretty well.</p>

    <p>But at the same moment, after Master Wu Xin took over the battle, he began to quickly control the entire battle situation. The first thing he did was to layer the God Brain.</p>

    <p>The divine brain they smashed was transformed by the divine brain's layered ability at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>But the real divine brain has been hidden by Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>This method is very similar to some boys who like to create hundreds of folders for indescribable movies and arrange them in a maze array. By the way, they also mark the folders with the words "I want to study hard."</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, it is actually a similar routine.</p>

    <p>As long as the True God Brain survives, Wu Xin will be alive.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, as the Eternal One had no intention of taking over the battlefield, the nature of the Supreme World changed. The Supreme World, which was originally a giant stone formation, suddenly turned into a dark, scorched earth, filled with a sense of death.</p>

    <p>Countless blackbirds as small as a horse bird with extremely long beaks are hovering in the sky, giving people a very ominous omen.</p>

    <p>Chaos death bird?</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng was in a trance for a while. He recognized the origin of this creature. At the same time, he was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>Because this is a bird that has been extinct for eternity. It is also one of the few creatures born from chaos.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a death bird turned into a jet-black light and swooped down from a distance. It was extremely fast, like a ghost, and had a strong oppressive force.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that a creature as big as a horse's feet could give people such a terrifying sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>It's really not that big.</p>

    <p>But he is not afraid of death at all.</p>

    <p>A suicide attack was launched directly here.</p>

    <p>People who are directly hit by the beak of the Chaos Death Bird will be dragged directly into Chaos and then wait to die.</p>

    <p>However, as the Eternal One, Monk Jin Deng is naturally not that easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>He set up the Immortal Vajra Dharma Light to form layers of barriers in an attempt to resist the attack of the Death Bird.</p>

    <p>However, the death bird seemed to have expected the monk's move in the air, and it temporarily changed its attack direction and stabbed Qin Zhong in the distance.</p>

    <p>Honestly. Qin Zhong's reaction was a bit slow. After all, he's only a Dao God. It's impossible for such a force to fight against the dreadful extinction of the Death Bird.</p>

    <p>He froze in place.</p>

    <p>As a result, the death bird passed directly by his scalp and hit the spot behind him.</p>

    <p>Immediately, a big explosion occurred behind Qin Zhong. A circular crater with a radius of 100 feet was blasted out by the overflowing chaos energy.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Although Qin Zhong has always believed that he is the only koi in the world of cultivation. He is confident and confident.</p>

    <p>And the moment he just escaped was indeed good luck. But he didn't know why. When the death bird passed by his scalp, he still felt as if he was about to face death head-on.</p>

    <p>"I see. The person standing over there is a master of luck."</p>

    <p>Except for Monk Jin Deng, he didn't know any of the people standing here. He didn't get any memories of these people from Nawei.</p>

    <p>So he summoned these death birds just for testing. Unexpectedly, he tested an extraordinary person.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Death Bird is an ominous symbol.</p>

    <p>It is an existence that specializes in restraining luck.</p>

    <p>Maybe one attack will fail. But if a few more are prepared, this may not be the case.</p>

    <p>Back then, many chaotic creatures that became extinct were not actually extinct.</p>

    <p>Instead, they were transformed by Wu Xin. Now these transformed chaotic creatures, like him, have become silent existences that cannot be locked using normal sensing methods.</p>

    <p>Therefore, chaotic creatures with suicidal attack capabilities like the Death Bird have become natural killer weapons.</p>

    <p>When there were thousands of death birds hovering in the sky like black clouds, the shock and depression were self-evident. Even Qin Zhong began to panic.</p>

    <p>Because these death birds that divide luck are indeed affecting him. He can clearly feel that the auspicious clouds above his head are weakening.</p>

    <p>How could this be so...</p>

    <p>He couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>It's just that a different person is operating it. The momentum is completely different from before.</p>

    <p>This is an Eternal...</p>

    <p>It was like a scorched earth world after the end of the world. At this time, Wu Xin's body was emitting a snow-white light. He stood here. He was holy like a god. He had the aura of great creation and immortality on his body.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it also released an extremely terrifying mental fluctuation, freezing everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception in place.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong is a person who gathers great fortune.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wu Xin didn't want to kill Qin Zhong just like that. It would be best if he could be brought back alive for research.</p>

    <p>And besides that, he also felt something very interesting.</p>

    <p>That is on this battlefield. There is actually a baby girl who has given birth to a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>"How could there be a baby?" Wu Xin released the fluctuations of his mind and shone on Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>He tried to use the power of his divine brain to analyze. The conclusion he came to told him that this was indeed a child that had just been born.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is...</p>

    <p>The smell of this baby girl is very strange.</p>

    <p>He used his mental brain to observe. He actually had a vague feeling.</p>

    <p>And just the next second.</p>

    <p>Just above the head of the baby girl, a number of black death birds equal to his appeared above, like shadows. They were doing the same movement as the death birds he controlled...</p>

    <p>Wrong...</p>

    <p>Not like a shadow.</p>

    <p>These birds of death seem to be shadows.</p>

    <p>This baby girl. Is it a master of the Dao?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wu Xin was extremely shocked.</p>

    <p>What a joke...</p>
