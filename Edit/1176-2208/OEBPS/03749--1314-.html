  <h1>Chapter 1314 Rat crossing the street</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It can only be said that Mr. Gray Mist's chaotic gray mist is indeed very powerful.</p>

    <p>If we use more intuitive data to reflect it. Although Wang Ling's one-hit hand knife can cause explosive damage output, as long as the chaotic gray mist is there, Gray Mist Lord can reduce the damage by up to 75%.</p>

    <p>And this is also the main reason why Mr. Gray Mist was able to stand up again after being beaten twice by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was injured, but not seriously injured. And the injuries were far from fatal.</p>

    <p>What surprised Wang Ling even more.</p>

    <p>In addition to the effect of damage reduction, this chaotic gray mist even has the ability to self-heal. And this self-healing can ignore the "serious injury" effect.</p>

    <p>The last person who was extremely confident in his "self-healing ability" was President Bai.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that President Bai didn't take into account that every normal attack of Wang Ling has a "serious injury" effect.</p>

    <p>So much so that after he was injured, he had no time to recover and returned to the west...</p>

    <p>And now. Marmot has fully demonstrated the professionalism that a qualified human shield should possess.</p>

    <p>He is not even afraid of serious injury!</p>

    <p>Even if you are beaten to a low level of health, as long as the chaotic gray mist is there, you can come back to life!</p>

    <p>He is indeed a difficult guy!</p>

    <p>In the universe. Wang Ling stared at Mr. Gray Mist who crawled out of the second pit. He was also thinking about countermeasures in his heart.</p>

    <p>If you want to kill this prairie dog, you must find a way to peel off this layer of chaotic gray mist.</p>

    <p>However, judging from the current results, Wang Ling has not thought of a suitable solution.</p>

    <p>Because this chaotic gray mist seems to have merged with the groundhog!</p>

    <p>Became an inseparable existence!</p>

    <p>"Because it has been hidden in the gray mist for too long, does the gray mist think of itself as an organ on this prairie dog?" Wang Ling speculated in his mind.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mr. Gray Mist climbed out of the second pit and was very depressed.</p>

    <p>The second slap in the face came too suddenly.</p>

    <p>He even suspected that he had picked up the wrong script.</p>

    <p>As the number one beast under Dao Ancestor Wang, he has never encountered such a scene of unilaterally accepting a beating.</p>

    <p>That monk Jin Deng has never gotten such a big deal from him!</p>

    <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>

    <p>On the surface of the moon, violent vibrations were heard.</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist jumped up from the spot again. He pointed his sharp claws in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Are you coming again?"Wang Ling didn't believe that this groundhog would repeat his old tricks.</p>

    <p>At such a distance, no matter how fast the groundhog is, he can immediately swat the groundhog back like a fly.</p>

    <p>Seeing that there may be a third deep crater on the surface of the moon soon.</p>

    <p>When Lord Gray Mist flew into the air, his sharp claws tore open a space. Then he turned his body into particles of light and quickly disappeared into the void!</p>

    <p>Did it disappear midway?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found out. This groundhog really wanted to get into his own mental space.</p>

    <p>It's really an all-powerful claw.</p>

    <p>Even the barrier to the spiritual space can be torn apart.</p>

    <p>This is considered a mistake by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that groundhogs had this ability.</p>

    <p>This caused him to be careless for a while.</p>

    <p>But what if it's in his mental space...</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, this prairie dog is looking for death.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The mental space of a normal cultivator is very small.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, the spiritual space of a powerful person is wide.</p>

    <p>Take the monk as an example.</p>

    <p>The spiritual world of a monk is about the level of a solar system.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's mental space...</p>

    <p>After Mr. Gray Mist entered, I felt completely stupid.</p>

    <p>Because he discovered that he had just escaped from a real universe and entered another spiritual universe...</p>

    <p>Wipe!</p>

    <p>This is the spiritual space that humans have!</p>

    <p>"Are you ready to die?" It was a cold voice. It sounded from the spiritual space universe of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sound seems to be the essence of the universe.</p>

    <p>Layers upon layers, with terrible echoes like the death knell of the ancient times.</p>

    <p>Coming from all directions.</p>

    <p>The familiar figure of White Hair appears. It is formed by the gathering of countless light particles.</p>

    <p>As always. It's like a god coming down to earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying manifested his figure in front of Lord Gray Mist. His eyes showed domineering and arrogance.</p>

    <p>"Are you... the shadow of this person?" Lord Gray Mist said with a gloomy expression.</p>

    <p>He felt it.</p>

    <p>The aura on this person's body is the same as that of the large shadow caused by the previous riot on the far side of the moon.</p>

    <p>From the power of the same avenue.</p>

    <p>The groundhog was surprised.</p>

    <p>Although it was just a face-to-face encounter, he could feel that the shadow in front of him was extremely strong.</p>

    <p>His figure is a mixture of reality and reality. It seems to be blended into this spiritual world made up of stars and sea. It is blurred and invisible.</p>

    <p>Those cold obsidian eyes are sharp and sharp. Even without the blessing of King's Eyes, they can still bring a huge sense of shock.</p>

    <p>Gray light flashes on the groundhog. The protective ability of the chaotic gray fog is once again improved!</p>

    <p>Now, the chaotic gray mist has been added to the 50% damage reduction effect. It tightly wraps him up and down.</p>

    <p>Marmot never thought that one day he would turn on Chaos Gray Fog to 50%.</p>

    <p>Because there is only so much chaos power in his body.</p>

    <p>50% of the chaotic gray fog. This means that most of the chaos power in his body is used in this chaotic gray fog.</p>

    <p>The damage reduction effect has increased. But at the same time, his power damage will also be weakened due to the distribution of the power of chaos in the body.</p>

    <p>"Relying on this layer of gray clothes, you can do whatever you want." Wang Ying's eyes became colder.</p>

    <p>Under such a compelling gaze, the Gray Mist Monarch finally reached the end of his patience: "Don't be so arrogant! When I was conceived by the Dao Ancestor, you weren't even DNA enzymes!"</p>

    <p>The groundhog took action. With the blessing of the gray mist, he stretched out his sharp claws and grabbed it with one claw!</p>

    <p>The void ahead is twisted. There is an invisible chaotic wave spreading, trying to imprison Wang Ying in it.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the gray mist lingering around him turned into wings at this moment, turning him into a flying groundhog!</p>

    <p>The divine wings wave. One wave can shrink the earth to an inch!</p>

    <p>Countless stars were swept into the storm. Then they were torn into powder by the strong wind.</p>

    <p>The marmot flapped its wings and stretched out its claws, trying to tear Wang Ying's body apart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying didn't even bother to dodge.</p>

    <p>When the claw hit his brain, it penetrated directly through his body.</p>

    <p>No harm was done to him.</p>

    <p>"What a stupid groundhog. He hit the shadow so hard." Wang Ying's eyes were cold.</p>

    <p>He has seen through it all.</p>

    <p>This chaotic gray fog is indeed the key.</p>

    <p>And the chaotic gray mist itself is actually somewhat similar to him.</p>

    <p>It is also a "nothing" thing. It has no entity.</p>

    <p>Then, as long as he breaks the chaotic gray mist, this groundhog will be easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>"You actually chose to come to the spiritual space of Wang Ling. You are really asking for your own death." At this time, Wang Ying had already thought of a way to break through the chaotic gray fog.</p>

    <p>He stared at the frightened groundhog in front of him with a "kind look."</p>
