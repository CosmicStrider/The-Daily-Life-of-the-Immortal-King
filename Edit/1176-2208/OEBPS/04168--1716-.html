  <h1>Chapter 1716 Cautious Victim</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Controlling Sun Rong is actually just a part of Bai Zhe's plan. Since he laid out the Baobai Group, he has used his stealth advantage in the air to control the overall situation. At the same time, he has developed gene-edited synthetic dragons. His ultimate goal is to play a big game.</p>

    <p>In this big game of chess, Sun Rong is a key piece. Therefore, no matter what you say, you must win it.</p>

    <p>However, due to his past experience in dealing with Wang Ling, Bai Zhe naturally knew that this man was not that easy to deal with. Therefore, this time, in order to collect the pieces of this big chess game, he made every move extremely cautiously.</p>

    <p>Infinite Milky Way. In a cloud-like unknown celestial body that exudes milky white light and is as holy as angel feathers. A faint humanoid outline appears. The beautiful face is coated with a faint moonlight color. The snow-white crystal body is otherworldly. Like the world. Outer gods.</p>

    <p>At the end of his tail, there is a slender white dragon tail. When waving, the sky is filled with starlight. It is like a bright moon held by stars, showing its emptiness and peerless elegance.</p>

    <p>This is what Bai Zhe looks like now.</p>

    <p>He became a consciousness through his own obsession.</p>

    <p>Last time, he imagined himself as Yang Shuangji, the younger brother of Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>But this time, he transformed into the Moonlight Dragon, one of the three leaders of the dragon clan in the early days of eternity...</p>

    <p>Supreme, bright, flawless, sacred...</p>

    <p>All holy words are not enough to describe his current state.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe didn't expect that after being insulted by Wang Ling several times, he would reach the point where he is today. He would become the leader of the Dragon Clan in the early days of the Eternal Age.</p>

    <p>So he felt like he could do it again.</p>

    <p>Feeling invincible.</p>

    <p>I feel that I can once again attack Wang Ling... the man who has repeatedly defeated him and hit the bottom.</p>

    <p>And this time, he fully learned the lessons from the previous times. Everything has been cautious.</p>

    <p>As long as it is a plan that can defeat Wang Ling or even threaten Wang Ling, he will not let go of any of them.</p>

    <p>"If we just take this girl named Sun away, I'm afraid she won't be a threat to him." At this time, a familiar voice sounded around Bai Zhe. It was a group of purple foam, flashing with a strange light. Look. It looks like a bunch of floating grapes. It is exactly the current state of Fenmu Shen, which inherited the Chinese and foreign Heavenly Dao tradition of Old Dominator.</p>

    <p>"Old Fenmu. I know what you are worried about." Bai Zhe said, with a hint of indifference in his tone.</p>

    <p>There is a sworn hatred between the Dragon Clan and the Outer Gods. Logically speaking, there is no such degree of cooperation. However, Bai Zhe is not essentially a member of the Dragon Clan. And Fenmu Shen was not originally from the Old Dominator system.</p>

    <p>They have each obtained the power of the two strongest factions in eternity through their own methods. At the same time, they are "victims" of the same person.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>

    <p>There is absolutely no possibility of cooperation between the Dragon Clan and the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>"He obviously doesn't like this girl. Even if this girl really dies, there won't be any disturbance in his heart. If you do it like this, why not destroy a few more snack shops..." Fenmu Shen suggested.</p>

    <p>"I have my own way."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe chuckled. His moonlight-colored outline was otherworldly: "So this time, I am not just targeting him. All the people related to him. I will capture them alive. Use them as pawns..."</p>

    <p>"I see. But he is not easy to deal with. The same goes for his sister."</p>

    <p>"This time, I am confident enough." Bai Zhe laughed: "I can't wait to see him put on that mask of pain..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Almost at the same moment, Jingze and Yan? received the latest instructions from the group.</p>

    <p>That is a list. Their requirement is that the people on the list must be captured alive one by one in the order on the list. No one can be let go.</p>

    <p>And on this long list, Jingze set his sights on the last name.</p>

    <p>Tired of it? He licked the cone. His pinky little tongue was stained with milky white ice cream. It made people think: "Hmm. What are you thinking about? This person named Wang Nuan. Is there anything strange about his name?"</p>

    <p>"Her surname is Wang. It is the same surname as the person monk Jin Deng mentioned." Jingze said.</p>

    <p>"But there are so many people named Wang in the world."</p>

    <p>"I know." Jingze said: "But this person is listed at the end of the list, and there are special remarks. The organization said that if you feel that you can't beat her, you can just run away. There is no need to compete head-on with this person. It can be said that this is The most special being on this list."</p>

    <p>Yan? She laughed out loud: "We have not fully inherited the full power of the dragon's power. It is normal to encounter situations where we are unable to defeat them. There is really no need to compete for the moment."</p>

    <p>"But I still want to see what kind of person this is. Since she can be such a special being...is this person related to the Buddha named Wang mentioned by monk Jin Deng... "At this time, Jingze felt confused.</p>

    <p>His memory was obviously not bad. However, he had just fought with Jin Deng not long ago. He actually forgot the name he just heard... He only vaguely remembered that the other person's surname was Wang.</p>

    <p>So Jingze guessed that maybe the power of some kind of law and order affected this part of his memory.</p>

    <p>It can actually drive the law to make the world forget its existence...</p>

    <p>It seems that this person is indeed extraordinary. Otherwise, such a method would never be possible.</p>

    <p>"Then let's make a quick decision." After a moment, Jingze looked at the long list and took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>This list seems to be arranged in order of strength. The organization's requirement is to capture as many people alive as possible. As an excellent worker and breadwinner, he and Yan? will certainly fulfill their mission.</p>

    <p>After capturing Guo Hao, Su Xiao, Li Youyue and others...</p>

    <p>Jingze and Yan? stood at the door of Chen Chao's martial arts gym.</p>

    <p>Although they had restrained their auras, Chen Chao quickly felt a killing intent when the figure appeared.</p>

    <p>With a somewhat hesitant expression, Chen Chao put down the stone pier he was using for strength training and pushed the sliding door open.</p>

    <p>But I saw a young man in a windbreaker and a little girl neatly dressed standing at the door.</p>

    <p>"It's closed now. You have to register for classes tomorrow," Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>Jingze looked at him without sadness or joy: "Sorry. Brave Chen Chao...no. It's Mr. Chen Chao. Now we need you to come with us."</p>

    <p>As a dragonborn, they almost habitually call others "brave." This is almost a fixed mindset. They have not changed it until now.</p>

    <p>"Ah? Take a trip? Where to go?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was stunned. He looked at Jingze's face that didn't look like a good person. He was frightened for a while: "You don't want to capture me as a hostage... We don't seem to have any grudges. Why do you want to capture me?"</p>

    <p>Jingze, Yan?: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Wait a minute! Are you not cultivators from Earth? Are you aliens?"</p>

    <p>Since the opening of cooperation between the Earth and Heavenly Dao, aliens have disguised themselves as human cultivators. There have been many cases of smashing, smashing, and robbing cultivators on Earth...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao has seen similar news, so he has concerns.</p>

    <p>And Jingze and Yan? were also a little surprised.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao asked several questions, and all of them were pretty accurate.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "You just called me brave... You are not the legendary Dragon people..."</p>

    <p>However, Jingze had no intention of letting Chen Chao continue to ask questions. After knocking him out with a chop, he directly took him into his core world.</p>

    <p>So many things were revealed all at once. Yan? doesn't even feel like having a cone in her hand anymore.: "What should I do... I really want to kill him..."</p>

    <p>"Um..."</p>

    <p>Jingze nodded silently: "Me too..."</p>
