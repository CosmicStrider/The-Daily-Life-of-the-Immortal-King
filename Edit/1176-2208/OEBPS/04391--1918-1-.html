  <h1>Chapter 1918 The Number 1 High School in the Cultivation World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Except for Talisman's problem, Wang Ling rarely sends text messages to Wang Ming. This time, too many strangers suddenly entered Number 60 High School. This made Wang Ling feel vaguely uneasy.</p>

    <p>So Wang Dacheng kept warning himself in the morning: Don't meddle in other people's business. It's better to do less than to do more.</p>

    <p>In the end, I couldn't help but take out my phone and send a message to Wang Ming to ask about the situation.</p>

    <p>Sure enough! Gossip and curiosity are contagious. Wang Ling remember that I was not a curious baby originally. But after spending too much time with Guo Hao and Chen Chao, I seemed to have developed this bad habit naturally...</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling was not the only one who was curious about this matter. Almost the entire Grade 1 and 3 classes were mobilized.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that as the elite class of Number 60 High School, Class 1 and Class 3 are worthy of being Class 1 and Class 3. Except for academic matters, everyone seems to pay more attention to external matters than to studies.</p>

    <p>Almost all of them are showing off their special abilities.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's message has not yet been replied. Sun Rong stepped into the classroom. The two looked at each other. Sun Rong said: "I have already heard the news. He is from Shengke."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Sun Rong would be the first to know the news.</p>

    <p>But this is not surprising. After all, the student union of Number 60 High School is actually the headquarters of Gray Cult. Now there are various branches of Gray Cult, both at home and abroad. It may be difficult to inquire about other things. But If those people were from the campus, it would be too easy to make inquiries.</p>

    <p>But why did people from Shengke suddenly visit Number 60 High School?</p>

    <p>Shengke. This name is familiar to all students.</p>

    <p>Because Shengke. It is Shengke University.</p>

    <p>It is currently the number one university in Huaxiu National High School Ranking and ranks third in the world! It is even more amazing than the original Fu Mo Number 1 High School and even the Uzumaki Emperor High School in Mixiu Country Glio City!</p>

    <p>So what is the ranking of Number 60 High School now?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembers how he has won several competitions since he came here. Number 60 High School is currently ranked 37th in the country and 126th in the world.</p>

    <p>But even so. It can only be regarded as an upper-middle level cultivation high school.</p>

    <p>It is far from a top college like Saint Science...</p>

    <p>So it stands to reason that the relationship between Shengke and Number 60 High School is incompatible.</p>

    <p>As a result, Shengke suddenly came to the door this time. This made Wang Ling feel extremely strange.</p>

    <p>The key is this kind of thing between campuses. Zhuo Yi, the director of the Hundred Schools Administration of Songhai City, cannot be unaware. But Zhuo Yi has not disclosed any information to him until now.</p>

    <p>This means that even Zhuo Yi does not know about this matter.</p>

    <p>Being able to skip the Hundred Schools Administration and connect directly with Number 60 High School. It also avoided Zhuo Yi. This does not mean that Zhuo Yi, a sesame cadre, is taken seriously at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found it interesting.</p>

    <p>Since Zhuo Yi embarked on this path, Sun Dakang, the leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance, has helped to guide him. This career has been smooth sailing. In half a year, he has achieved three first-class merits and various second-class merits. There are no less than ten honors in total. This is something that ordinary people cannot even imagine.</p>

    <p>Many people know that Zhuo Yi is popular. They are all rushing to curry favor. Although Zhuo Yi is polite and hides far away. It still manages to stick to its true heart and stay out of the mire. But they don't. Zhuo Yi There are still very few people who regard it as an onion.</p>

    <p>After all, it is Shengke...</p>

    <p>The number one academic institution in the field of cultivation in Huaxiu. Sure enough, it has such confidence.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the teachers and teachers here, even the students, they always hold their heads high when they go out.</p>

    <p>This is unique in Huaxiu's educational background system that focuses on collective honor. As a student of the first university, you should feel proud of your alma mater.</p>

    <p>In Shengke, some powerful young geniuses are even more popular. From time to time, they can be searched several times on the Internet. Wang Ling is because of seeing too many such hot searches. So Sun Rong just mentioned it Go to Shengke. He will understand everything.</p>

    <p>Those well-known students of Shengke are so popular that even celebrities and Internet celebrities cannot compare with them.</p>

    <p>This is not an exaggeration of Wang Ling. Rather, it is true.</p>

    <p>He almost subconsciously turned on his phone and clicked on Weibo to take a look. Two of the top ten hot search terms were related to Shengke.</p>

    <p>One is the news that a student from Shengke participated in an alchemy competition abroad and won a gold medal.</p>

    <p>The person who made the alchemy was named Su Xingyue. She was one of the star female students of Shengke. Her alchemy skills were extremely superb. She even had the experience of competing with Immortal Toya on the same stage. Su Xingyue, who was only 13 years old at the time, almost won the alchemy competition. The famous Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>I still remember this news Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The other piece of news is about Qu Yiling, the student union president of Shengke University. However, this piece of news seems to be a bit like gossip news.</p>

    <p>The front of Qu Yiling was not photographed. In the photo, only the back of a young man who looked a bit like Qu Yiling was eating barbecue with the girls. The young man was shirtless and fair-skinned. It was obvious that he had a good figure.</p>

    <p>The supporting news headline is: "Shocked! The president of the Student Union of Saint Science College is suspected of abusing his power. Guiding the new student union members to conduct an "icebreaking operation" to sweeten their feelings..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling As soon as you look at the title of this news, you will know that it is fake news. Although the person in the photo does look a bit like Qu Yiling from behind, such rumors are really too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>A person like Qu Yiling, who can sit in the position of student union president, is considered a genius among geniuses. He can be promoted to the Nascent Soul stage before graduating from high school.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for such a person to indulge himself in barbecue easily, let alone use his position to indulge in frivolous activities.</p>

    <p>After judging that it was gossip, Wang Ling was too lazy to read any more and quickly turned off the phone.</p>

    <p>However, this gossip hot search also reflects from the side that Shengke's attention in the industry is amazing.</p>

    <p>Students like Qu Yiling and Su Xingyue are young and have become famous at a young age. They already have no shortage of spiritual resources. When they go out to do endorsements, they can earn a lot of money. They can exchange for all kinds of rare things. Cultivation supplies are almost always a snowballing operation.</p>

    <p>However, becoming famous at a young age also comes with a price. That is, you will receive attention and attention from all parties. You will lack freedom to a certain extent. Your behavior will be seen by everyone. With such attention, Wang Ling even You will feel that it is difficult for them to even breathe.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling is really glad that I can study and live in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Although he occasionally gets into trouble, at least he lives a very private and comfortable life. Even his study and life are relatively quiet.</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ling sighed like this.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao's excited voice suddenly came from outside the door. He originally went to find out the news. But he didn't find out the information. This time, he found out the results of the monthly exam.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the classroom, he was heard whistling C language: "Fuck! Wang Ling! You have risen in the rankings in the whole grade. Ranked first! Awesome, Lingzi! Fuck! Awesome!"</p>

    <p>How could I call this? Wang Ling suddenly felt a headache and held his forehead.</p>

    <p>The slap in the face came too suddenly. He decided to take back what he just said. Studying and living a quiet life...</p>
