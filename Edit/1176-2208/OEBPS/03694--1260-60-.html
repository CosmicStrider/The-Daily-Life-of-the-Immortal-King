  <h1>Chapter 1260 The night of demolition in 60th grade!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The difference between the void world and Wang Ling's imagination is not that big.</p>

    <p>It is somewhat similar to the God Realm, but there are differences.</p>

    <p>The world of gods is also a bright and beautiful scene.</p>

    <p>The only difference from the void world is that there is dense vegetation there.</p>

    <p>God. When he has nothing to do, he likes to raise some flowers and plants... Actually, it's normal.</p>

    <p>But the world of emptiness has nothing in it. It can almost be described as a blank.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought of what the Sun Spirit said to him before.</p>

    <p>"Behind the Void Gate. There is emptiness..."</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling suddenly understands what this means.</p>

    <p>He could feel that in the surrounding space, there were countless ethereal spirits invisible to the naked eye floating around.</p>

    <p>They seemed like those mayflies in the depths of the ocean.</p>

    <p>Even though it is dense, it appears extremely small against the backdrop of the entire world.</p>

    <p>"This is the world of emptiness. How is it? Are you excited?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the Lord of the Void's words came again, interrupting Wang Ling's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was in no hurry to take action.</p>

    <p>Although the Lord of the Void's tone made him feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>What's more, it has never been Wang Ling's temperament to take the lead.</p>

    <p>Never fire the first shot. This is one of the Chinese military rules...</p>

    <p>After all, they had just met. They didn't do anything to him. Killing him as soon as he came up seemed a bit too overbearing.</p>

    <p>"Join the Void. Become a citizen of the Void. You will be able to enjoy the taste of the peak."</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void further said: "You can enjoy the lives of everyone here. You can even dominate your own world."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is confused: "?"</p>

    <p>Lord of the Void: "Mainly by thinking. Our Void people behind the Void Gate. The thinking is all connected together."</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling understands.</p>

    <p>Emotions, this ethereal spiritual life, all depend on YY...</p>

    <p>A bit low!</p>

    <p>It's all YY anyway. Wouldn't it be nice to read it in a copy?</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling no longer intends to stay.</p>

    <p>He thought how powerful this Lord of the Void could be. It turned out to be just a king of lust.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is planning to use the Wang Ling technique to bring himself back to his original world.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's surprise, the Lord of the Void had no intention of stopping it.</p>

    <p>In fact, this was also the Lord of the Void who saved his own life.</p>

    <p>Just before Wang Ling left. He left two sentences for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"I know. You think that the imaginary world does not really exist. But have you ever thought that human life itself may be the biggest fantasy."</p>

    <p>This is the first sentence left by the Lord of the Void to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, he said: "You have indeed completely killed Xu Bai. Xu Bai in the real world no longer exists. But I want to remind you. Xu Bai in the imaginary world... you can never destroy him." ..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Wang Ling's figure had completely disappeared into the void world.</p>

    <p>Several minutes passed. In the silent void world, the voice of the Lord of the Void came again: "What an amazing power..."</p>

    <p>It took him several minutes to calm down.</p>

    <p>Xubai will lose. Not without reason.</p>

    <p>This amazing sense of oppression. Even the Lord of the Void felt scared.</p>

    <p>The first words he spoke were "I am your great Lord of the Void."</p>

    <p>In fact, the Lord of the Void already knew it when he said it.</p>

    <p>After saying this, there is a 50% chance that the boy in front of you will be slapped to death.</p>

    <p>However, for the sake of the king's dignity, the Lord of the Void still gave it a try.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Wang Ling was not angered by his words.</p>

    <p>At that time, the Lord of the Void was sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a man who has received nine years of compulsory education. His qualities are indeed different...</p>

    <p>"Great Lord. Are we going to let him go like this?" At this time, the voices of other ethereal spirits came from the side.</p>

    <p>"That's all.</p>

    <p>It's enough." The Lord of the Void shook his head. The truth is very clear.</p>

    <p>There was nothing he could do to stop Wang Ling from leaving.</p>

    <p>And the Lord of the Void knows it very well.</p>

    <p>Can ignore the gate of the void and freely enter and exit the world of the void alone. Only this person can do it.</p>

    <p>Xubai's death at the hands of such a person was not unjust.</p>

    <p>"Are we about to retreat..." Many ethereal spirits nearby asked.</p>

    <p>"The last two sentences I left for him said it all."</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void was silent for a moment and said: "We can't prevent Xu Bai's death. We can't stop him from obstructing our actions."</p>

    <p>Having said that, the void invasion plan seems to have completely failed with the death of Xu Bai.</p>

    <p>However, just when all the Void Spirits were disappointed, the Lord of the Void said again: "Failure is only temporary. Even if we cannot find the Sons of the Void in the short term, they will eventually become the people of the Void. Return to the Void..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling returned from the void world.</p>

    <p>Those virtual spirits that had invaded the human body have left the human body in various forms.</p>

    <p>Maybe they are still wandering in the earth. They cannot return to the void world.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knows. This is a sign of weakness from the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>He remembered what the Lord of the Void told him before he left the void world.</p>

    <p>The profound meaning in these words couldn't help but arouse Wang Ling's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Xubai in the fantasy world...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels a sense of foreboding.</p>

    <p>He used the many avenues in his body to sense and once again confirmed the fact that Xu Bai had completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>This world. There are other worlds. The whiteness of all worlds no longer exists.</p>

    <p>However, the words of the Lord of the Void made Wang Ling particularly concerned.</p>

    <p>When I got home, it was already early morning on Friday the 25th.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling received a message from Zhuo Yi: "Master. Those cultivators who have been confirmed to have been invaded by void spirits have really returned to normal! As expected of the master! This time, the void creatures can be said to be comprehensive. Defeated! Also, there is no need to worry about Number 60 High School. The engineering team will arrive this morning. The construction will be completed in 3 days! Classes will begin next Monday!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this text message and felt calm.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it. Zhuo Yi has done something good again this time.</p>

    <p>In the future, Zhuo Yi will add another highlight to his personal deeds: the night of demolition of Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>With the retreat of the void creatures, the tense situation on the General Alliance side was also calmed down. Lord Diulei was released.</p>

    <p>Later Wang Ling heard that General Yi was indeed invaded by the void beings... Fortunately, the void spirits retreated in time, which allowed General Yi to return to normal. If it had been a little later, Head of State's kill order might have been Approved.</p>

    <p>Everything seems to have been resolved satisfactorily.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling feels that there are still things missing.</p>

    <p>Just this morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling received a message from the class group.</p>

    <p>It is said that Sun Rong suddenly fell seriously ill.</p>

    <p>And...has been pushed to the ICU.</p>
