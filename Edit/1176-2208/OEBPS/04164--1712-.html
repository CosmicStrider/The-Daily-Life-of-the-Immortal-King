  <h1>Chapter 1712 Extra scapegoat</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The instant the Monk Jin Deng's breath disappeared, Wang Ling, Wang Ying, and the Death Heavenly Dao sensed it almost at the same moment.</p>

    <p>This fearless spirit of sacrificing oneself to save the world is in line with the monk's usual style. It's just that he throws this mess back on himself. It makes Wang Ling a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>He did not kill the two dragonborns. He chose to be swallowed by the "God-Eating Umbrella." He wanted the two dragonborns to realize the importance of freedom, instead of being willing to bear the identity of the dragons and take responsibility for the unknown evil people.</p>

    <p>As for whether Jingze and Yan can finally realize their enlightenment. Wang Ling himself doesn't know very well. The only thing he knows is.</p>

    <p>If these two dragons found him in the end, and since his attack was neither light nor heavy, they would probably die.</p>

    <p>"Monk Jin Deng's situation is more complicated. It can't be said that he is completely dead. He is just dying." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>According to the last information provided by Monk Jin Deng. Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Death Heavenly Dao received a lot of intelligence information.</p>

    <p>"On his deathbed? In other words, he is not dead yet?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"Well. That God-Eating Umbrella at sequence level three has the ability to devour the core world. It can also use the core world's abilities for its own use. The dragonborn named Jingze has just swallowed Jin. The core world of Monk Deng has not been digested yet." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"In other words, if there is no digestion, as long as the black umbrella is broken, the undigested core world will be automatically released, and the monk will be able to come back together, right?" Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, that's true." Death Heavenly Dao nodded. The expression on his face was a little worried: "These two dragon descendants are not bad, even if the monk of Jin Deng did not give up resistance in the end, it is also a bitter fight. Even the monk is still like this, the rest of the people if you run into ... is certainly a situation of life or death."</p>

    <p>"I think there is no need to be so pessimistic. The only way to prevent such a situation from happening is to be prepared."</p>

    <p>"What preparation?"</p>

    <p>Just as Death Heavenly Dao was talking to Wang Ying, Wang Ling showed off the mountain of Talisman in his King's Eyes space.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao recognized it almost at a glance: "Death Talisman?"</p>

    <p>He remembers that when this was last done to save Sun Rong, his brother Heavenly Dao of Life was treated as a drudgery substitute for the painting, but fortunately, the Sun Rong girl was quickly rescued and did not continue to be affected by the power of the curse.</p>

    <p>However, the number of extra talismans has reached more than 1.7 million. Now they are piled up in the King's Eyes of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If it is used for cash, Wang Ling will become the richest person in the world.</p>

    <p>"So Ling Zhenren means..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. The Lord has bound these many death talismans to everyone related to him to ensure that they will not be affected by this incident."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying laughed: "If these resurrected people know nothing about my Lord's ability, they will also have an additional memory erasure effect. They will forget the memory of the period before and after their death. They will treat everything as if it never happened. pass."</p>

    <p>More than 1.7 million death talismans...</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao held his forehead. Immediately he couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>He is a professional Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Never laugh.</p>

    <p>Unless I can't help it...</p>

    <p>But this is so funny!</p>

    <p>More than 1.7 million lives...</p>

    <p>Even if these two dragonborn are strong enough to turn people into ashes with one palm, they must be scolded if they can face people who are constantly resurrected and reorganized with death talismans, right?</p>

    <p>And these death talismans. Although they were made by the surviving Heavenly Dao, in fact the materials used to make Talisman were all enlightened by Wang Ling. And after the death talismans were completed, they were used by Wang Ling inspired a wave of enlightenment.</p>

    <p>Double strengthened scapegoat. Resurrection of anyone you want! And unstoppable!</p>

    <p>No matter what method the other party uses, it cannot be interrupted!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the "demon mirror" trio composed of Er Ha, Xiang Yi, and Qin Zhong also received the message that the monk had gone to "Before Dying" at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Can this really make those two baby dragons wake up?" Xiang Yi expressed doubts about what Monk Jin Deng did.</p>

    <p>"Maybe it will be useful." Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>After all, among the Eternals, excluding Dao Ancestor Wang, apart from Peng Xiren, only Monk Jin Deng has the most seniority. Monk Jin Deng chose to do this. There must be a reason for doing so.</p>

    <p>But what he was more worried about was the crazy revenge of the two dragonborn.</p>

    <p>This race is warlike by nature. This behavior of the monk is a shame to them.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I'm not afraid of fighting. What I'm afraid of is that they won't come. The death talismans on the commander's side are ready. There are more than 1.7 million in total!" Er Ha replied firmly. It is also synchronized here. News about the arrangement of the "Substitute Death Talisman" has been received. This gives it a high degree of confidence. At least it can relax and do trouble in the next actions. There is no need to worry about life and death.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. As expected of Ling Zhenren. He has his own way of doing things!" Qin Zhong laughed.</p>

    <p>At this time, the three of them had arrived below the cadre apartment building of Yue Weizhi, where Gu Shunzhi lived. They came to verify Gu Shunzhi's identity, and they all had a vague sense of foreboding.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was not at home when he opened the door. Gu Shunzhi who came to open the door was no different from usual. His face was full of smiles and his expression was bright and sunny: "You are here? Come in quickly!"</p>

    <p>You can't see any difference from the outside.</p>

    <p>But even without the beauty mirror, Qin Zhong had already felt something strange. He felt that something was wrong with Gu Shunzhi's state. This was an indescribable feeling. It could also be said to be Qin Zhong's sixth sense.</p>

    <p>And when he quickly took out the beauty mirror and placed it in front of Gu Shunzhi's face, Gu Shunzhi's face in the mirror became distorted almost instantly.</p>

    <p>"Good family man ... not really ..." Qin Zhong exclaimed.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Gu Shunzhi's mind epidemic also quickly pushed Qin Zhi away: "Damn it!"</p>

    <p>He didn't think that he would be found out even though he had been lurking so well, and he hadn't even warmed up this body!</p>

    <p>"Don't come over here!"</p>

    <p>Facing the threat of the Er Ha, Qin Zhong, as well as Xiang Yi, snapped, quickly ah! Sword fingers together, against his throat: "If you come over, I do not guarantee the lives of your friends!"</p>

    <p>He is so threatening.</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi all looked cold.</p>

    <p>The two of them looked at each other for a moment. Then Xiang Yi took out a pistol version of the Nine Sun Divine Sword from his waist. He aimed it at Gu Shunzhi's head and shot him with a bang!</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. Gu Shunzhi's brain and blood flew away. He lay in a pool of blood...</p>

    <p>The thought plague that invaded Gu Shunzhi's body never imagined that these people would be so ruthless to their friends.</p>

    <p>The host's body dies. As a host, the host naturally withers away very quickly...</p>

    <p>In fact, not long after the Thought Plague completely withered, the tissue fluid flowing on the ground quickly returned to Gu Shunzhi's head at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>This is the correct use of the scapegoat!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi frowned. He lay on the ground. He felt a little pain in his head. After rubbing his head, he got up from the ground.</p>

    <p>This time. It's really Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>He felt like he had just had a nightmare.</p>

    <p>He felt like someone had shot him in the head.</p>
