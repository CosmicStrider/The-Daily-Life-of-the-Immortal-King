  <h1>Chapter 1280 The wonderful adventure of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As for the sequelae of spiritual consecration, monks see it more among cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Star Lord is from the Shenlong Clan. From the perspective of earthlings, this is an alien creature... who knows what kind of problems will arise.</p>

    <p>The monk has been worried about this situation.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until a few minutes later that the Heavenly Dao star master woke up after the "spiritual consecration" was completed...</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with me?" Star Lord opened his eyes, revealing the unique crimson vertical spear of his Shenlong Clan.</p>

    <p>Compared to the depressed state before, Heavenly Dao Star Master's face has obviously improved a lot.</p>

    <p>The girl with natural curly hair applauded even more fiercely: "Wow! Monk! You are so awesome! I showed him so many videos but he still can't be cured. Just touch it with your hands and it will be cured!"</p>

    <p>"Miss Ajuan, I'm sorry. She's just a little kid."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled bitterly and shook his head: "But I have to remind Miss Ajuan. Now that she's healed, don't show him the video anymore."</p>

    <p>Everyone's acceptance level is different.</p>

    <p>The monk is mainly worried that the Heavenly Dao star will become autistic again after watching the video.</p>

    <p>"Na na na! Monk! Can you touch me too!" The girl revealed her starry eyes with an expression of extreme envy.</p>

    <p>"Miss Ajuan is in good health. It will have no effect if the poor monk touches her." The monk smiled awkwardly.</p>

    <p>"Does that mean it only needs to be broken somewhere?" the girl asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Whether it's a person or an object." The monk answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>After all, the other party is the King of the Divine Realm. The monk still maintains considerable etiquette and does not dare to cross the line in the slightest.</p>

    <p>Although he had previously had the idea of accepting a female monk as his disciple when he first saw the girl.</p>

    <p>However, when he learned about the origin of the girl with natural curly hair, he gave up completely this year.</p>

    <p>He also knew that it would be impossible for a divine realm king to be his disciple...</p>

    <p>"Then something is broken! Monk, can you fix it?" At this time, the girl who wanted to see the monk's magical consecration technique asked hopefully.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Jin Deng asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Membrane." The girl answered at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>"Membrane..." The monk held his forehead. The horror in his heart was like a stormy sea.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that the legendary King of the God Realm would be so open and bold...</p>

    <p>For a moment, the monk's thoughts were confused.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how to answer the girl's question.</p>

    <p>"Is this difficult to repair?" Miss Ajuan frowned when she saw the monk's slightly troubled expression.</p>

    <p>"..." The monk fell silent.</p>

    <p>He wanted to speak bluntly. This thing will break when it reaches a certain age...</p>

    <p>But he felt that it would be too straightforward if he said it directly. As a monk, he should be more reserved.</p>

    <p>But at the next moment, the girl took out her mobile phone: "Look, the film on my mobile phone is cracked!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, it turns out to be a mobile phone screen protector..."</p>

    <p>The monk suddenly understood. He breathed a long sigh of relief and began to reflect sincerely. As a serious and enlightened monk, why did he think of some strange knowledge...</p>

    <p>He said "Amitabha" more than ten times in his mind.</p>

    <p>Then he reached out and touched the girl's cell phone.</p>

    <p>This film was opened and restored to like new.</p>

    <p>And the hardness is several levels higher than before.</p>

    <p>It can even be used to block big moves.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, monk!"</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan thanked her. Then she patted Heavenly Dao Star Lord on the back and said, "And you! Thank you, Master!"</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Master..." Heavenly Dao Star Lord was stunned and thanked him one after another.</p>

    <p>"You shouldn't be afraid of Ling Zhenren now, right?"</p>

    <p>In order to confirm that his spiritual consecration technique had no sequelae, the monk asked.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current results, everything seems to be normal on the surface.</p>

    <p>However, at the next moment, Heavenly Dao Xingzhu opened his dragon claws: "Thank you, Master. I am not afraid at all now! I even feel like I can beat Ling Zhenren to death!"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng, Ajuan girl: "..."</p>

    <p>"Monk. Why is this happening?" Miss Ajuan asked worriedly.</p>

    <p>She felt that the intensity of the consecration was a bit too violent...</p>

    <p>"It's okay. The sequelae are probably overconfidence. I hope Miss Ajuan will take good care of him. If he is shot to death by Ling Zhenren... the poor monk will not be able to save him even with the consecration technique..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Zhuo Yi holds the Buddha's Golden Lotus in his hand. He stares at the girl's soul sealed in the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels like he is holding a mini figure with full-body stereoscopic projection.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong was guided into the Golden Lotus by the monk, his soul was still sleeping peacefully.</p>

    <p>But now there are signs of waking up.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior?"</p>

    <p>After the girl's soul woke up, she looked at the Buddha's Golden Lotus with a surprised expression.</p>

    <p>--etc!</p>

    <p>This line seems a bit familiar!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Zhuo Yi was already prepared. He took out his mobile phone. He opened the question and answer document he had typed before. Then he manually clicked on the artificial speech recognition playback function...</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, all the questions were answered. The girl finally understood her current situation.</p>

    <p>"So I can still be saved now, right?" Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed in his heart that Sun Rong is so big-hearted. He can still maintain such an optimistic attitude at this time.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, senior Zhuo Yi, for telling me these things about classmate Wang Ling. I will keep it confidential." Sun Rong promised.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Actually..." Zhuo Yi was a little embarrassed: "Actually, I shouldn't have told you this. Master has always been very low-key. And Sun Rong Junior Sister, in fact, everything I'm telling you now Things. You will forget them when your soul returns to your body..."</p>

    <p>After much thought, Zhuo Yi decided to tell the girl this cruel fact.</p>

    <p>He doesn't want to cheat Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I understand, Senior Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded: "But I will try my best not to forget it!"</p>

    <p>"Then come on, Sun Rong school girl..." Zhuo Yi smiled politely.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, it is almost impossible to return to the physical body and still retain the memory.</p>

    <p>"Um, senior Zhuo Yi, can you do me a favor?" At this time, the girl suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Junior said it's okay." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's like this, Zhuo Yi senior... I've always wanted to see what kind of comments the outside world has on me after I lay on the hospital bed." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She has always been the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Everyone around her is extremely respectful to her. This makes Sun Rong feel unreal. But this time after the Yin and Yang Death Tribulation incident.</p>

    <p>For girls, this may be a good plan to hear the truth.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong, school girl, are you sure? The reality may be much crueler..." There are different opinions on this matter from the outside world. Zhuo Yi feels that if he agrees to the request like this, he may be dissatisfied with Sun Rong causes damage.</p>

    <p>"I just want to hear the truth."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong always maintained a generous and decent smile: "And Zhuo Yi senior, didn't you say that after I return to the body, everything will be forgotten? So even if I hear some bad remarks, it shouldn't matter, right? "</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is silent.</p>

    <p>After a while, he still said: "Tell me. Sun Rong Junior School Girl. What do you want to do? I will fully cooperate with you."</p>
