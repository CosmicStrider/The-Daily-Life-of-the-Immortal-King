  <h1>Chapter 1525 Take advantage of his illness! Kill him!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's aura becomes weaker.</p>

    <p>For Peng Xiren and Fenmu Shen inside, this is a perfect opportunity to take action.</p>

    <p>As the first true disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang, he accepted the teachings of Dao Ancestor Wang and learned the most orthodox cultivation knowledge in the universe.</p>

    <p>Years of study experience told him that everything in the world has a law of conservation.</p>

    <p>No one is powerful without reason.</p>

    <p>And. It can continue to be strong forever...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Peng Xiren felt that he had seized this unique opportunity.</p>

    <p>Take advantage of his illness and kill him!</p>

    <p>Is there anything more wonderful than this in this world?</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling dies.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is convinced that no one else in this world can organize himself...</p>

    <p>"So. Are you going to take action?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen opened her eyes slightly.</p>

    <p>"Yes. The opportunity is now before us. I don't know what happened to him. But he has become weaker than before."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren nodded. He said, "Earlier. His normal punch could produce the power of a hundred cores. Now, he is so weak that he can only hit ten cores."</p>

    <p>"Nucleus." "Core" for short.</p>

    <p>This is the unit of measurement of combat power after the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>With the power of 1 core, it can easily destroy the planet and kill anyone in the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>Dao God. They are all just ants.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is currently an ancestor level master. He has the strength of Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>Just counting. The combat power of a normal strike is about 50-60 cores.</p>

    <p>After he fought Wang Ling last time, it was determined that Wang Ling has the power of 100 cores.</p>

    <p>Such a gap scares Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's breath became weaker. Peng Xiren no longer felt afraid.</p>

    <p>In fact, he didn't expect it at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's punch. Not only was it not serious, but it was also punched while being sealed.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he seriously underestimated the true combat power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is an information asymmetry...</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, it's all the same.</p>

    <p>This time, the reason why Wang Ling chose to participate in the closed-door competition was not just for the sake of instant noodles. It was also for the prize money of the competition.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he has arrived. If he insists on participating in the competition.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming will definitely put many seals on Talisman like this repeatedly to suppress his overall combat power.</p>

    <p>Under the influence of so many [Incomplete Versions of Sealed Talisman], Wang Ling's aura became weaker. In fact, it was also one of the effects of Talisman's suppression.</p>

    <p>And after the breath weakened...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Judgment. Peng Xiren must be taking action.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Everything is actually calculated by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This wave. It looks like Wang Ling is on the first floor.</p>

    <p>The operation is actually on the second level.</p>

    <p>But the real core...</p>

    <p>Actually it's on the 1,000th floor.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before noon, the martial arts hall of Jiudaohe High School became the main venue for this closed-door meeting.</p>

    <p>The Budokan is not very big. It is about the size of two basketball courts.</p>

    <p>There are audience seats nearby.</p>

    <p>All the audiences this time are high-quality audiences who have been strictly screened by the student union of Jiudaohe High School. They are all students within Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>And everyone goes through a series of checks before entering.</p>

    <p>Make sure that no one carries modern technological equipment or magic weapons that can record images and sounds.</p>

    <p>Since it is a closed-door meeting, zero transmission must be achieved.</p>

    <p>Every link is personally participated and strictly controlled by Jisaki.</p>

    <p>Everything is to better fulfill the request Sun Rong made to him.</p>

    <p>"Everything is ready. Is Rong Jiang satisfied?" Before the Closed Door Match begins. Jisaki was standing in the central control room of the martial arts hall, looking at the surveillance screen in front of him.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong and Wang Ming. Just next to Jisaki.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is here to provide technical support.</p>

    <p>If there are people at the scene who are carrying equipment privately and slip through the net, Wang Ming can easily catch it with his own means.</p>

    <p>"It's all thanks to you, Brother Ji." Sun Rong smiled politely.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome." Jisaki touched his head sheepishly: "But, Rong Jiang, are you sure you don't want to participate? In fact, we are all looking forward to seeing Rong Jiang's heroic appearance."</p>

    <p>"As long as classmate Wang Ling can participate," Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Not participating in the competition. Sun Rong also has its own considerations.</p>

    <p>In fact, she didn't want to face Wang Ling in the subsequent games.</p>

    <p>Secondly, there is no need for her to participate in the competition.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is clear. Wang Ling entered the contest. Part of the reason was for the prize money.</p>

    <p>That was used by Wang Ling to buy a gift for Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the girl naturally had only support.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is a good brother.</p>

    <p>You can think about your sister even before she is born.</p>

    <p>Sometimes when I think about it carefully, Sun Rong suddenly realizes that I am quite jealous of Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>But she also knew that such jealousy was actually very childish.</p>

    <p>A brother is good to his sister. Isn't that what he should do?</p>

    <p>Perhaps everyone has dreamed of having an older brother who is extremely kind to them.</p>

    <p>The topic of Brother Guoqian is also a hot search almost every year, triggering heated discussions among everyone.</p>

    <p>Once. Sun Rong also thought about it.</p>

    <p>It would be nice if I could recognize Wang Ling as my older brother...</p>

    <p>But now.</p>

    <p>She had completely forgotten the idea.</p>

    <p>Because she discovered that her "ambition" was greater than she imagined.</p>

    <p>Just last night.</p>

    <p>She also dreamed about going camping in the wild with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the dream, she was sleeping in a sleeping bag. In order to see her sleeping face clearly, the boy kept turning her body like a pot sticker and pointed her sleeping face in the direction of the boy.</p>

    <p>This is an unspeakable dream.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong even felt the young man's presence close at hand. And those clear eyes...</p>

    <p>She reached out her hand from her sleeping bag and wanted to touch the boy's face.</p>

    <p>But I haven't touched it yet.</p>

    <p>The person has already woken up.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what Rong Jiang is thinking. But if you sign up for the competition now, it's actually not too late." At this time, Jisaki smiled and said.</p>

    <p>These words settled the girl's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushed slightly and nodded: "Well..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a few minutes, the closed-door match is about to begin.</p>

    <p>This time, in Jiudaohe High School, almost all the students from Class S were present, plus some students from Class A. There were 62 people in total.</p>

    <p>The players' waiting room. Wang Ling is sitting on an armchair and resting. He seems to be in good condition.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Jisaki, and Wang Ming watched everything in the monitoring room.</p>

    <p>They are God's perspective.</p>

    <p>Can see the overall picture very clearly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling was waiting for the game to start. A group of girls suddenly gathered around.</p>

    <p>"You must be Houlang Sang! You have been in President Jisaki's class! You disappear every time after class. I can't find you! Now I finally found Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! Houlang Sang is cuter than I thought. I'm embarrassed to play against him. What if I get drawn to play against him?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The unexpected scene made Jisaki couldn't help but smile: "Sure enough, Houlang Sang is very popular."</p>

    <p>He was about to see Sun Rong's reaction. But he found that the girl who was standing next to him had disappeared.</p>

    <p>When he came to his senses, a girl's figure had reappeared in the scene of the contestants' waiting room...</p>

    <p>Under the stunned eyes of everyone.</p>

    <p>Many people in the waiting room exclaimed.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Isn't this classmate Jiugong Liangzi?</p>

    <p>Shouldn't she study abroad in Huaxiu?</p>

    <p>Why did you come back suddenly?</p>
