  <h1>Chapter 1729 Wang Ling laughed when they found out</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the moment when Wang Ming hit the back door of the aircraft carrier and caused it to disintegrate, thousands of missiles fell together, covering almost every inch of the aircraft carrier. Like firecrackers, the fire was blazing, and big explosions continued to occur on the sea.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the air waves surged into the sky. The endless sea water was evaporated by the fire and kept churning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has been lurking in the sword spirit space of Sun Rong. It was not until the last moment when Wang Ming approached the aircraft carrier that he took action.</p>

    <p>In addition to changing the direction of the missile warhead, it also unilaterally suppresses all living things on and off the entire aircraft carrier to ensure that the mother body of the Thought Plague will not escape.</p>

    <p>And this move is one of the branch skills "We are all wooden people" in the "Great Suppression" in Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Once this technique is activated, all people in a fixed area will be imprisoned. They will not be able to move at all. Even magic weapons will not be able to be used normally. Even the soul will be in an imprisoned state and cannot be transferred.</p>

    <p>This method is used to deal with the mother body of the thought plague. In Wang Ling's opinion, it is the best.</p>

    <p>So. When the back door of the giant aircraft carrier was punched through by the giant Wang Ling mecha and disintegrated. Along with the missile explosion, the mother body of the Thought Plague was also devoured by tongues of fire in an instant. In Old Dominator, they mainly focus on mental invasion. Means. In fact, the physical strength is the weakest!</p>

    <p>Once targeted, that is, when the soul cannot be transferred and the body is exposed, even a Soul Formation cultivator can easily crush the opponent to death...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the giant aircraft carrier was destroyed, Wang Ming could clearly feel that this spiritual space had returned to his control.</p>

    <p>He set the giant Wang Ling mecha he controlled as a new base. At the same time, he directly controlled the mecha to lie flat on the sea. It turned into a giant ship and completed its transformation.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Master Wu Xin was also captured at the same time. He was taken away by Sun Rong at the moment the aircraft carrier disintegrated. Now he is bound by the sword Aohai.</p>

    <p>It is a very skillful tortoise shell binding. The posture is graceful and a bit coquettish.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that I could come back." Wang Ming knelt down and couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"Hmph..." Master Wu Xin twisted his face. It was obvious that he did not accept this outcome: "If my mind hadn't fully recovered, how could you, two mere juniors, be my opponent..."</p>

    <p>"Even if you don't want to admit it, it is a fact that you lost. Although I didn't know what agreement you reached with that Bai Zhe before. But now that I have regained sovereignty, I do know a lot of things." Wang Ming said. There was a somewhat thoughtful expression on his face.</p>

    <p>After regaining control of the mental space, the memories of all the contacts between Master Wu Xin and Bai Zhe were also synchronized into Wang Ming's mind.</p>

    <p>What is certain at present is that the other party is indeed preparing a plan to revive the dragon clan. It will excavate a large number of dragon skeletons in the dragon cemetery and piece them together to extract the genes. Then use a supreme magic to revive them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming captures memories. Then shares these memories with Wang Ling, Sun Rong and others.</p>

    <p>"That guy turned out to be the Moonlight Dragon, one of the three leaders of the dragon clan? Hahaha. This guy is really haunting." At this moment, Wang Ming really couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe...</p>

    <p>A man who was repeatedly whipped to death by his younger brother Wang Ling. This time he actually imagined himself to be the Moonlight Dragon, one of the three leaders of the Dragon Clan...</p>

    <p>In terms of combat power alone, this should be Bai Zhe's strongest combat power so far.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how many slaps he can get from Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He had no idea about the dragon clan. He only knew from rumors that this clan was very strong. At its peak, it even surpassed the Old Dominator.</p>

    <p>As one of the leaders of the three dragon clans, Moonlight Dragon. Wang Ming also learned a special ability called "Eternal Moon Star Glory" from the memory of Master Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is the breath of the Moonlight Dragon.</p>

    <p>Haunting the entire body of the Moonlight Dragon. It has a strong healing effect!</p>

    <p>And the most important key is that Eternal Moon's Armor ignores serious injuries!</p>

    <p>Previously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's slaps all have serious injury effects. This hinders the healing ability of all those who are passively beaten. Now there is the existence of "Eternal Moon Star Glory."</p>

    <p>Maybe he can really fight Wang Ling for ten rounds?</p>

    <p>But obviously, the key factor in the current problem is not here. Rather, it lies in what is the purpose of reviving so many dragonborns?</p>

    <p>An ordinary dragonborn cannot be Wang Ling's opponent.</p>

    <p>Even if the three major leaders of the dragon clan want to deal with Wang Ling, they still have to through their own weight.</p>

    <p>This point. As an old rival of Wang Ling, Bai Zhe should be very clear about this.</p>

    <p>In the past, Bai Zhe's blind confidence has become a habit. This time, although he has become the Moonlight Dragon and has the strongest combat power in history, he will not repeat the same mistakes and continue to be blindly confident and then overturn in public.</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute. I seem to have discovered something. But I don't know what it means yet." At this moment, Wang Ming suddenly said.</p>

    <p>Through Master Wu Xin's memory, he discovered a strange symbol that Master Wu Xin had seen in the Dragon Tomb when he borrowed his body.</p>

    <p>It was a strange symbol made of potholes. It looked like it had been left behind by something. Wang Ming burned the strange symbol from his memory and drew it on the ground. Then he fell into confusion.</p>

    <p>"What is this? Does anyone know?" Wang Ming asked. From the shape of the symbol, it looked a bit like a diamond.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao pondered for a while. The expression on his face suddenly became horrifying: "Ah this..."</p>

    <p>"Senior Death Heavenly Dao. What did you think of?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I feel... it's a bit like the Seal of Eternal Punishment!"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao touched his chin and said: "Back then, there was actually a theory that the Eternal Dragon Clan was destroyed overnight... It is said that it was because the Dragon Clan was too powerful, which caused the universe to be forced to activate the check and balance mechanism. The Dragon Clan was destroyed The existence of the universe has been erased. And this kind of punishment caused by the ability to balance the universe is called the punishment of the universe. So I wonder if this is the legendary punishment of the universe..."</p>

    <p>"Seal of Zhou's Punishment?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying smiled: "If this is the case, Bai Zhe is now reviving the Dragonborn. The purpose is not only to revive the dragon clan, but also to restart the eternal punishment. And then bring this disaster to the earth. Use the power of the eternal punishment to eliminate the leader?"</p>

    <p>"It's very possible!"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao couldn't help but shed a few drops of cold sweat: "Now. Sun Rong girl's spirit sword is fused with nine old Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes... and has been living on the earth. It is very likely that the universe will mistakenly think that the earth is the universe. Center. In addition, there are Ling Zhenren and Lord Shadow on the earth. Once the Eternal Dragon Clan is resurrected in large numbers on the Earth, the cosmic punishment that was caused in the Eternal Period may really reappear!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard this. The corners of his mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao looked puzzled: "I don't know why Ling Zhenren doesn't look nervous at all?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying shook his head: "Because even if based on the above reasoning, Bai Zhe really intends to activate the check and balance mechanism of the universe, it will be useless."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "Why?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying folded his arms and sighed: "Because now, the authority of this punishment is in the hands of the Lord himself."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "?"</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe's current layout is equivalent to handing a letter of complaint to the universe. He is trying to use the checks and balances mechanism of the universe to suppress the Lord."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ying said this, he couldn't help but laugh: "But have you ever seen anyone accept complaints about themselves?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
