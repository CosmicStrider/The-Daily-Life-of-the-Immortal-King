  <h1>Chapter 1578 The tacit understanding between brother and sisterâ‘¡</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Not an ordinary person?</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's body frowned. After losing one percent of his soul power, the pain that came back through his mind and soul made him frown.</p>

    <p>Because of Peng Xiren's body, Fenmu Shen inherited the benefits of the entire sky tomb.</p>

    <p>But now Fenmu Shen finds that he seems to be restrained by this physical sentence.</p>

    <p>After all, it's still not as useful as his original body...</p>

    <p>Because the strength of the physical body is somewhat lower than the original body, even the pain caused by the backlash will be doubled. The flexibility is also much lower than before.</p>

    <p>He was filled with surprise. Now even he began to doubt whether he really couldn't beat this baby.</p>

    <p>"I know. I won't believe I can't kill you."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's face turned pale. I don't know why the more he and Wang Nuan fought, the more humble he felt like a clown.</p>

    <p>In such uneasiness, Fenmu Shen began to frantically sacrifice the Chaos Artifact he had obtained in the Sky Tomb.</p>

    <p>The supreme battle!</p>

    <p>He roared. He held a six-winged supreme sword and waved it towards Wang Nuan. It rolled up a golden wave! Legend has it that it was made from the phoenix feathers of the chaotic black phoenix, the beast of time.</p>

    <p>This is a wave of time that can make years pass crazily. Those covered will be affected by a weak aura, which will accelerate aging and death.</p>

    <p>But what Fenmu Shen didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan actually also used his own Shadow to copy a supreme sword.</p>

    <p>It's just that this supreme sword is not six-winged.</p>

    <p>It's from Sixty-Six Wings...</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl directly copied and upgraded it into the Supreme Supreme Battle 66. And it is also a PLUS...</p>

    <p>A bigger golden wave of aging is coming. Hedging against Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Not to mention swallowing up all his time waves. It also completely covered Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>The pain of aging has caused many cracks to appear on Fenmu Shen's young body.</p>

    <p>After the wave passed, his skin completely drooped and relaxed, and all the muscles in his body disappeared...like a sponge that had been drained of water and shriveled up.</p>

    <p>However, this kind of aging power does not lead to death.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen absorbed the power of chaos in the space. He used the power of chaos to supplement himself. He restored his body bit by bit.</p>

    <p>And then. In the ensuing battle...</p>

    <p>The previous scene repeated itself like sit-ups.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen used - "Tianba Nightmare Spear!"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan copied and upgraded--"Tianba Nightmare Gun PLUS!"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen used the "Withered Shield" made from the face of the most shameless author in history, Ku Xuan! It released the dragging light wave. Trying to slow down all Wang Nuan's actions!</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan copied and upgraded--"Mugu Shield!"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen used - "Hongmeng Whip!"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan copied and upgraded--"Hongmeng whips his father!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As the battle progressed, Fenmu Shen discovered a very embarrassing situation.</p>

    <p>He thought he had earned an entire "Heavenly Tomb" by relying on Peng Xiren's body.</p>

    <p>This is a very good deal.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that the little girl in front of him now, even if he did not inherit the Sky Tomb... could also use his Shadow ability to copy the eternal chaos period he inherited from the Sky Tomb.</p>

    <p>In other words, the more you use the chaos weapons in these tombs, the faster the other party will grow.</p>

    <p>And he will also draw inferences from one instance and upgrade the magic weapon.</p>

    <p>No matter what kind of chaos weapon he uses, it will eventually be countered.</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Fenmu Shen was surprised to find that he had turned into a... tool man?</p>

    <p>Carefully recall the entire journey from controlling Peng Xiren's body to successfully finding the entrance to the tomb to defeating the old woman guarding the tomb.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen suddenly frowned and realized something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because all of this seems to be going too smoothly.</p>

    <p>How could a cunning old guy like Dao Ancestor Wang only send an old woman to guard the door of a place as important as the Sky Tomb?</p>

    <p>He has fought against Dao Ancestor Wang many times. He has a good understanding of Dao Ancestor Wang's character.</p>

    <p>Now that I think about it carefully, I feel that all of this was a calculated trap.</p>

    <p>If the old guy takes into account the fact that he switches into Peng Xiren's physical body, his combat power will actually be limited.</p>

    <p>Counting the enemy he will face later, it will be this weird shadow girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>After all, all the magic weapons he inherited in the Sky Tomb will be countered by this girl...</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen didn't dare to think about it anymore.</p>

    <p>To him. Dao Ancestor Wang is dead.</p>

    <p>An old guy whose whereabouts are unknown. How could he have predicted what happened today aeons ago!</p>

    <p>Impossible...</p>

    <p>It can't be like this!</p>

    <p>Although Fenmu Shen didn't want to admit it, there was indeed a bit of fear in his eyes at this moment.</p>

    <p>And now the problem before him is Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen had no other choice.</p>

    <p>He must completely kill the girl in front of him to prove that he has not been plotted by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>After the thoughts on his livid face returned, he directly reached out to grab Wang Nuan. He didn't believe that he was a Heavenly Ancestor. He couldn't even deal with a newborn baby girl!</p>

    <p>If he is defeated by Wang Nuan here, he will be forever engraved on the pillar of shame in history!</p>

    <p>However, what awaited him was Wang Nuan's ruthless ravage.</p>

    <p>A black square mark appeared. It was very similar to something Fenmu Shen had seen in the sky tomb. The huge pressure turned into the word "human" and bombarded him. Hitting his body one after another.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen couldn't feel the physical pain. But when these markings hit his body, they erupted with a terrifying energy that penetrated into his soul.</p>

    <p>Then the herringbone marks that were struck on his body exploded after being immersed in the depths of his soul. The explosion caused Fenmu Shen's body to roar.</p>

    <p>It was as if he had just swallowed several firecrackers.</p>

    <p>"Herringbone Avenue Seal...How could she have this..." Fenmu Shen became even more horrified.</p>

    <p>Because Ah Nuan girl sacrificed a tomb chaos weapon that he had never shown before!</p>

    <p>--Herringbone Avenue Seal!</p>

    <p>This is the Chaos Device that Fenmu Shen found in a golden coffin in the Sky Tomb. It is very old. Although it is very strong, it has long lost its power. It is so incomplete that it cannot be put back into use at all.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen did not throw it away. Instead, he planned to collect it first, hoping to find a way to repair it in the future.</p>

    <p>And in the celestial tomb, like the herringbone avenue seal, it was already incomplete.</p>

    <p>But there are still many powerful chaos weapons that have been famous throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>The situation at this time had already made Fenmu Shen aware that the situation was different.</p>

    <p>He did not display this incomplete product.</p>

    <p>This girl was actually able to use the power of shadow to restore it. She even repaired it at the same time.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen was completely silent.</p>

    <p>Because he thought of a shocking fact that he had to admit...</p>

    <p>That is. The little girl in front of me has probably used her Shadow ability.</p>

    <p>Completed a copy of the entire tomb!!!</p>

    <p>PS: The easter egg chapter has Fenmu Shen's character design. The coloring has not been completed yet. It is just a line drawing to complete Fenmu Shen's current appearance for everyone (this is what Fenmu Shen looks like after taking Peng Xiren's body and merging with Peng Xiren. In other words, part of the human shape belongs to Peng Xiren)</p>
