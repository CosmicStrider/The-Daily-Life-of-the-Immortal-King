  <h1>Chapter 1221 Boss Sun's Conditions</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Principal Chen, Lao Gudong has been waiting on the reception sofa on the first floor for a long time.</p>

    <p>Downstairs of the building, Jiang Xiaoche, dressed in an exquisite suit, went downstairs to greet him personally. With a very professional smile on his face: "You two have been waiting for a long time. The chairman asked you to go upstairs to talk."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Principal Chen nodded.</p>

    <p>The two of them had just stood up. Jiang Xiaoche smiled and praised: "I have heard about the reputation of Principal Chen and Teacher Wang for a long time. It is really a blessing to meet today. Xiaoche grew up under the cultivation of Huaguo Shuilian Group." It's a completely closed management study. I don't have the opportunity to go to school to experience life. It's really a pity."</p>

    <p>"Then Secretary Jiang is welcome to come to our Number 60 High School to experience life at any time." Principal Chen heard this and was polite.</p>

    <p>"It's easy to talk." Jiang Xiaoche smiled as he led the two of them towards the elevator.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong met Jiang Xiaoche for the first time. I just felt that this young boy with oily hair and pink face exuded a strong social atmosphere.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he didn't like it very much.</p>

    <p>If a cultivator's pyrotechnics are too strong, it will also have an impact on the realm. Based on Lao Gudong's experience in the world of cultivation, he observes words and colors, and recognizes people. He has his own set of rules. So his impression of Jiang Xiaoche is not very good.</p>

    <p>As a secretary, the most important thing is to be able to do things quietly. Sooner or later, being smooth will lead to big trouble.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong shook his head secretly. He did not expose this point directly. He could not tell Boss Sun why he kept such a person on the side. Sun Yiyuan could make the company so prosperous. Watch people His ability may not be weaker than his. Maybe Jiang Xiaoche is also his chess piece.</p>

    <p>The elevator quickly rose to the highest point of the building. Under the leadership of Jiang Xiaoche, Principal Chen and Lao Gudong walked through the corridor leading to the office. On both sides of the corridor were calligraphy and paintings by everyone in the literary and art circles. Principal Chen secretly watched Amazing... this is the strength of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. The paintings in the corridor. Just selling one of them is enough to renovate Number 60 High School two or three times.</p>

    <p>A huge office. Boss Mr. Sun is sitting on the spacious sofa. He is playing with the tea set on the table. Three cups have been poured. Principal Chen and Lao Gudong have just been introduced. Jiang Xiaoche consciously stood aside and then gently Exit the office. Close the door. Guard the door skillfully.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is very knowledgeable. It seems that he already knows the purpose of our trip." When Principal Chen saw this scene, he knew that this uninvited visit between him and Lao Gudong had been completely ignored by the gray hair in front of him. The old man who lost his heroic spirit took control with one hand.</p>

    <p>I have long heard that the Huaguo Shuilian Group has spies all over the world. The intelligence grid is even comparable to that of the Office of Strategic Deception. Especially in Songhai City, it is bottomless.</p>

    <p>At this time, Principal Chen and Lao Gudong fully understood this power.</p>

    <p>"There is no need to be rigid between you and me. Let's sit down and talk. Teacher Wang doesn't need to be too rigid. You are one of the most trustworthy people around Tianxiang." Boss Sun smiled. He immediately put the brewed tea on the table. Pushing it in front of the two of them: "In school. Teacher Wang takes such good care of Rongrong. I am very grateful."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun, you're too polite. It's just your duty as a people's teacher."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong smiled. As soon as he picked up the tea, Mr. Boss Sun's next sentence immediately made him freeze.</p>

    <p>"I don't know. Is Teacher Wang's junior brother still okay?"</p>

    <p>When he said this, there was no wave on Sun Yiyuan's face. He still had a kind smile, but there was a coolness that could penetrate the bones.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Wang also has a junior brother?" Principal Chen was surprised. Even he didn't know about this.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong thought that his identity and the affairs of his junior brother, Taotie Taoist, had been well hidden. It could be described as seamless. He did not expect that he would be embarrassed in front of Mr. Boss Sun today.</p>

    <p>However, it was obvious that the other party did not intend to expose him directly. Instead, he gave him an indirect blow.</p>

    <p>"Yes... of course there is..." Lao Gudong had no choice but to continue following the conversation: "It's a junior fellow student I haven't contacted for many years. He is also a teacher. He is currently working in another school."</p>

    <p>"Zukang, you are not interesting enough. Our Number 60 High School is in need of talents. Wouldn't it be nice if you directly recommended them to our school?" Principal Chen was immediately displeased.</p>

    <p>"His teachings are actually very average..."</p>

    <p>"You have always had high standards and requirements. In my eyes, the average person is already good enough."</p>

    <p>"Haha. We can talk about this later. I believe Teacher Wang didn't hide it on purpose. I'm afraid it's his junior brother. The teaching quality is indeed not high." Mr. Boss Sun smoothed things over. His signature kind smile was here. At that time, in the eyes of Lao Gudong, it was completely like a smile hiding a knife.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong used his peripheral vision to pass through the heat emanating from the tea cup. He looked at Sun Yiyuan secretly. He felt that this person was extremely dangerous and unfathomable.</p>

    <p>"Tianxiang. Are you here for Yi Zhiyang this time?" Then Boss Sun asked straight to the point.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, nothing can be hidden from Mr. Sun's eyes." Principal Chen was noncommittal.</p>

    <p>"I also know the opinion given by the psychologist. It is nothing more than asking us Rongrong to play a fake match with him again and deliberately lose to him."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Sun. The competition is pseudo-public. We will make arrangements for everyone involved. The competition footage will not be leaked. It will not have any impact on the stock of Huaguo Shuilian Group..."</p>

    <p>"That's not what I'm worried about. But cracking down on match-fixing will eventually involve the face of our Sun family." Boss Sun said, "What's more, this little guy is the adopted son of General Yi. Even if we have to crack down on match-fixing, it will be used to treat this problem." The little guy's psychological problem. Shouldn't the sword master come to me personally?"</p>

    <p>"Ten generals are busy with official duties... Mr. Sun should understand..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care if he is a general or a ketchup. Since you are asking for help, you should have an attitude. But, this time, Tianxiang, you are here in person. It's not like I can't give you a favor."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong chuckled to himself. He talked in circles for a long time. Everything was exactly as he had imagined at the beginning... The old fox really started to make conditions!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun, please tell me. As long as the request is not too excessive, we can discuss it." Principal Chen was a little nervous. He didn't know what Sun Yiyuan wanted.</p>

    <p>"To tell you the truth, due to some reasons, our Rongrong family may need to take a break from school for a while. During the break, I will invite the best teachers to come and teach."</p>

    <p>When Mr. Boss Sun said this, he couldn't help but let out a sigh. Even his voice began to tremble: "But you two also know that our Rongrong has accumulated feelings for our classmates and teachers in the school during this half-term. In a short time, It's hard to let go of time. Her parents died early. As a grandfather, I can't bear to let Rongrong suffer this kind of separation..."</p>

    <p>"Then what Mr. Sun means..." Principal Chen seemed to have understood something after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"I hope that the students in the elite class of your school can take turns coming to our Sun Family Villa to accompany my Rongrong to class. I will give high compensation to the students who accompany them!"</p>

    <p>"Compensation?"</p>

    <p>"Material compensation, as well as spiritual compensation. Whatever you want, as long as our Sun family can provide it, we can provide it." Boss Sun said: "I have written the rotation list of accompanying students!"</p>

    <p>"This... can I take a look first?" Principal Chen wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Sun Yiyuan took out the prepared list from his pocket.</p>

    <p>Principal Chen and Lao Gudong took the order and took a look.</p>

    <p>I saw on the roster that Boss Sun had indeed made a detailed plan.</p>

    <p>Accompany designated students on Monday: Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Accompany designated students on Tuesday: Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wednesday. Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Friday...</p>

    <p>Or. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Principal Chen, Lao Gudong: "..." What about the agreed rotation?!</p>
