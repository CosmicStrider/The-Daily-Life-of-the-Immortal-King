  <h1>Chapter 1862 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is no doubt that this matter is tantamount to a public execution for Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had some premonition, it still felt extremely magical. After such an eternity, Zhang Zhui actually had to face his dark history again. The mood at this moment must be particularly complicated.</p>

    <p>Obviously, at this time, Zhang Zhui had extremely blind confidence in his treasure-stealing methods. He even didn't even take the Emperor seriously.</p>

    <p>He even dared to directly steal the things that the Emperor put up for auction. This was truly extremely courageous.</p>

    <p>"So in history, was this theft successful?" Wang Zhen couldn't help but asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Of course it was successful." Zhang Zhui said with a somewhat proud expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"The Western Emperor didn't want to kill you, senior?" Wang Zhen asked again.</p>

    <p>"He wanted to skin me and chop off my hands. But at that time, he underestimated the enemy. He didn't take me seriously at all."</p>

    <p>"That's not right. I remember that according to the historical trajectory, this matter did not seem to be successful." At this time, Emperor Dongda questioned.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it was a success."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui chuckled and said: "But in order to save his own face, Emperor Xi used a temporary replica of the fake product and sold it. Afterwards, he ordered someone to recycle the fake product at a high price. He only said I failed for the outside world."</p>

    <p>"I, Zhang Zhui, have never failed in the industry. How could I let him spread rumors?"</p>

    <p>"At that time, I was so angry that I decided to take precise revenge. As a result, I almost didn't let go of the concubines in Emperor Xi's harem."</p>

    <p>"Therefore, although I, Zhang Zhui, have not married, I should have left many heirs."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I found Senior Zhang. You can survive...it's really a miracle."</p>

    <p>In the team voice chat. Sun Rong couldn't help but like it.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that Zhang Zhui's strength at this time has not yet reached its peak. But he actually survived the emperor's pursuit. This is really not easy.</p>

    <p>Trade Central Star. Central Auction House. This is the largest auction house integrating 108 stars in the entire trade galaxy. All treasures and big deals on the trade star will be gathered here.</p>

    <p>There was still some time before the gathering of the Four Emperors. Emperor Dongda decided to come to the auction house to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>This is something that is part of the historical trajectory. So it's impossible not to do it.</p>

    <p>The magnificent palace with its carved beams and painted buildings occupies a vast area.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw several real door-keeper beasts that were not angry and fearful. They were squatting at the gate under the guidance of the auction house manager.</p>

    <p>"The eternal lion dragon beast... I have seen it in the classics at home." Wang Zhen marveled.</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, this lion dragon beast has the head of a lion and the tail of a dragon. It is huge in size, like two hills.</p>

    <p>It is a famous mythical beast throughout the ages. It is extremely difficult to tame. But once it is successfully tamed, it will be loyal to its master and never leave.</p>

    <p>It is not easy for a capable person to tame one.</p>

    <p>Every time the Central Auction House holds an auction, there are four domesticated eternal lion dragon beasts guarding the entrance to the palace.</p>

    <p>This shows the power of the boss behind this auction house.</p>

    <p>"A few years ago, I remember that there were only two lion dragon beasts in front of the gate. Unexpectedly, there are already four this year. And they are all adults. The boss of the Central Auction House is really powerful."</p>

    <p>An old woman with her snow-white hair tied up high stepped out of a bronze chariot on crutches. She had a kind face and was not angry or proud. She was a secret top expert.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can tell how extraordinary this old woman is with just one glance.</p>

    <p>At the very least, she is a master of the Ancestor Realm. And she has just entered the realm of Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>"This is the headmaster of the Immortal Mountain Sect. Mrs. Shanxiu." Zhang Zhui introduced this person's identity.</p>

    <p>"It turns out he is the headmaster. No wonder she has extraordinary bearing." Sun Rong praised.</p>

    <p>The cultivators of the Eternal Period have retained the most primitive style of cultivators. They come in all shapes and sizes, which is very different from the modern cultivating society.</p>

    <p>This is definitely not something you can see in school textbooks in the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Seeing with your eyes and feeling with your heart are of great help and enlightenment.</p>

    <p>"Welcome Mrs. Shanxiu." As soon as the auction house manager in front of the door saw the old woman, he immediately knew the old woman's identity and bowed.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu nodded slightly with a kind face. She glanced at the four gatekeeper beasts, and then walked in slowly.</p>

    <p>Even a strong person in the ancestral realm can still feel a slight pressure when facing four huge door-suppressing beasts.</p>

    <p>Even the masters of the ancestral realm were like this. The others who entered the auction house were even more frightened.</p>

    <p>"So scary..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. These lion dragon beasts are domesticated. They don't have orders and won't attack people on their own initiative."</p>

    <p>An insider said when passing by the door: "They guard the door. They have a very good deterrent effect. They are also a kind of screening. People who are too weak are not qualified to enter the central auction house. They will faint just after passing the door."</p>

    <p>"So it is."</p>

    <p>The passers-by on the side heard this and nodded quickly: "But I still don't understand something. Why are there four of them at the door this time..."</p>

    <p>"It is said that the famous thief Zhang Zhui is coming to steal the emperor's auction items today. Two more were added temporarily."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Inside the team's sound transmission technique. Emperor Dongda was puzzled: "You will have no problem entering with Li Ren's body. Given your state at that time, can you successfully enter the auction house? There is only one entrance to the Central Auction House. The rest of the temple is protected by a barrier. If you want to go inside, you can only go through the main entrance."</p>

    <p>"Indeed it is."</p>

    <p>In a daze, Zhang Zhui also felt that his memory seemed to be a little confused: "In my memory, it was very smooth when I first entered the Central Auction House. There were not so many gatekeepers at all."</p>

    <p>"So. I have always wondered if you were bragging." Emperor Dongda was speechless.</p>

    <p>He never had a good impression of Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>The only good impression he had was limited to Zhang Zhui's experience of taking Emperor Xi's concubines in subsequent history.</p>

    <p>Although a small number of Emperor Dongda's own harem concubines were taken by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui was a disaster. He did not leave any seeds of his own to sprout in the Eastern Region Imperial Palace next year...</p>

    <p>Unlike the West Dadi side, it was already a vast prairie.</p>

    <p>"Are you bragging? We'll find out later." Zhang Zhui chuckled.</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Let's not talk about this for now. Let's talk about it after we go in." Dongda waved his hand, too lazy to argue with Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Wearing casual clothes, they entered pretending to be passers-by cultivators. The "Eastern Emperor" played by Wang Ling was at the forefront.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling could feel the eyes of the auction house administrator focusing on him as he set off. The four lion dragon beasts at the town gate also focused their attention on him.</p>

    <p>It was a shock. Everyone who entered the Central Auction House would experience this baptism of staring eyes to prove that they were worthy enough to enter the auction house and participate in transactions.</p>

    <p>But something unexpected happened.</p>

    <p>Just when the sight of these four lion dragon beasts fell on Wang Ling, a terrifying and dangerous aura instantly rebounded!</p>

    <p>All spiritual pressure and sight pressure are ineffective against Wang Ling. This will instead trigger Wang Ling's ability to passively reflect pressure...</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>The four lion dragon beasts that guarded the gate all had their eyes widened and started to sweat profusely.</p>

    <p>Since there are so many people entering the industry at the same time, they have no idea who is reflecting this pressure.</p>

    <p>It's just that they can clearly feel that when the person passes by the gate, it seems as if a machete is directly placed on their necks, making them feel chilled all over.</p>

    <p>Boom...</p>

    <p>Just after Wang Ling entered the auction house, there was a roar of huge objects falling to the ground in front of the door.</p>

    <p>The movement was so huge that it made the ground beneath their feet tremble.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, he just passed the gate. He actually scared four lion dragon beasts alive.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>This is too wasteful.</p>

    <p>What kind of mythical beasts are they...</p>

    <p>Not as strong as his Er Ha.</p>
