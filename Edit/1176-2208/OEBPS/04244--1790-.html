  <h1>Chapter 1790 Wang Ling's power</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chilan Society Office. Levis used a huge satellite telescope to remotely monitor the situation ahead. The armed bus that he had tampered with was moving forward according to the original plan.</p>

    <p>"Tengu's hands and eyes are really powerful. There are even Tengu people in the Huaguo Shuilian Group." Levis said with a proud smile.</p>

    <p>"They have been cautious enough. They have brought in old employees who will not betray easily. But we can use some means to replace those people without anyone knowing it. Imitate their daily habits and appearance." Sister Alley said.</p>

    <p>"In another twenty minutes, they will follow the navigation system I deployed and directly cross that area..."</p>

    <p>Levis hummed; "As long as they pass through there, it will be a big incident that they cannot solve, whether it is the Huaguo Shuilian Group or the Office of Strategic Deception..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When the cunning electronic prompt sound of the evil navigation sounded, Butler Lin immediately knew that this armed bus had been tampered with.</p>

    <p>Obviously everything was still normal during the acceptance check last night.</p>

    <p>He also tried the navigation system himself to make sure everything was accurate before getting out of the car.</p>

    <p>And the commissioners from the Huaguo Shuilian Group he arranged to protect it throughout the night...</p>

    <p>When Butler Lin thought of this, an idea suddenly flashed in his mind.</p>

    <p>If under such circumstances, the system of the armed bus has still been modified, then it can only mean that one of the two employees he arranged to follow last night is a member of Tengu.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin raised his eyebrows. He never expected that this trip abroad would not only turn into a confrontation between cultivating countries, but also start an espionage war... Isn't it too exciting?</p>

    <p>"Miss and classmates, don't worry. I'll stop the car right away," Butler Lin said.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin, don't be busy. The bus can stop at any time. What we should figure out most now is what their purpose is in tampering with the system." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin slapped his head: "Yes! Miss is right! Let me see..."</p>

    <p>After speaking, he stared intently at the route determined by the bad navigation screen. Then he frowned deeply: "I remember this direction is... the Mixiu Country Cultivation Army Garrison Base in Glio City?"</p>

    <p>"Oops. It seems they want our armed buses to force their way into the military base!"</p>

    <p>"When the time comes, if they report this move with embarrassment, it will be interpreted as a provocation! The problem we are facing will become an international dispute! And we will still be on the rude side."</p>

    <p>The other party's methods were more sinister than Wang Ling imagined. He came to Glio City for two days just to use his world snack coupons.</p>

    <p>As a result, the person behind all this did not even give him such an opportunity. This made Wang Ling feel unbearable.</p>

    <p>He never advocated taking the first action. But at this time, he felt that he had to issue a warning to the opponent.</p>

    <p>"Dad?" At this time, Wang Muyu said to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He deliberately called Wang Ling. But he found that Wang Ling did not respond to him.</p>

    <p>Even if you know what is going to happen next.</p>

    <p>It's obvious. Wang Ling is going to take action.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was sitting on Wang Ling's lap. Although he couldn't hear Wang Ling's inner voice, he could feel a kind of free anger from the slightly trembling fingers of this crispy noodle maniac dad.</p>

    <p>Next, Wang Muyu felt a deep light flashing in Wang Ling's King's Eyes. This was a kind of pupil summoning ritual. It seemed to be summoning something terrible to the scene...</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>What's wrong with this group of people? Why bother with such a monster?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just when the armed bus was less than 10 kilometers away from the garrison base, the ground began to shake. A huge, inaccessible black mountain rose from the cracked ground in front of it, roaring continuously.</p>

    <p>"What... what is this..." Everyone in the garrison base saw this scene. They all looked shocked. They are all outstanding soldiers.</p>

    <p>They had strong enough psychological qualities, but they couldn't help but feel weak in the face of the sudden situation before them. This giant beast that was spawned directly from the earth was too terrifying, its dark back was like a row of mountains, glittering with a kind of demonic light.</p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>The huge roar blew up a hurricane, blowing everything in front of it to the sky. The land cracked. Endless trees were uprooted, sweeping the land in front.</p>

    <p>"What is this..." Butler Lin and the rest of the people in the car were dumbfounded. They looked at the giant beast in front of them that was attacking the garrison base in surprise.</p>

    <p>In the car, people were discussing one after another.</p>

    <p>"Is it a monster?"</p>

    <p>"No way... doesn't the demon world coexist peacefully with us now?"</p>

    <p>"It's definitely not a monster. I can feel strong psychic energy from this big guy. And this big guy has no ill intentions towards us at all." Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>Anyone with a keen sense of spiritual power will notice that there is no trace of demonic nature in this giant beast that suddenly rises from the earth. Instead, it is extremely powerful spiritual energy!</p>

    <p>Surpassing all the spiritual beasts currently on earth!</p>

    <p>But there is still a gap between the sacred beast and the divine beast.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still kept his hand.</p>

    <p>Just a small punishment.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, with his ability, he could summon any holy beast or divine beast, which would be enough to destroy a cultivation country.</p>

    <p>The giant beast in front of him was the spiritual beast he summoned from the hole from the center of the earth using the power of King's Eyes. It had never appeared on the surface of the earth, so most cultivators knew nothing about its identity.</p>

    <p>Although there are many hypothesis studies about the hollow center of the earth in the world, no one has ever reached there. This is why Wang Ling confirmed that there is such a place.</p>

    <p>It was because he once made the spirit of the earth cry that he knew there was such a place.</p>

    <p>The world in the hollow center of the earth is huge.</p>

    <p>Like the spiritual beast summoned by Wang Ling now. It is more than thirty feet long. But it is just a cub inside.</p>

    <p>Before being summoned here, this giant beast cub from the center of the earth was having a meal with its mother. As a result, it was sucked to the surface world in the next moment.</p>

    <p>This made the giant beast from the center of the earth feel inexplicably frightened. So the moment it appeared, not only the people at the garrison base were frightened. Even the giant beast itself was frightened.</p>

    <p>It opened its steps and aimed one foot in the direction of the base in front of it...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the entire Mixiu Country Cultivation Garrison Base in Glio City panicked.</p>

    <p>Although the armed bus mark Wang Ling had appeared on their radar signal before, the signal mark of the armed bus had now been completely covered by this sudden behemoth.</p>

    <p>"Hurry and report to the colonel! There is a giant beast attacking! And there is no record in the database! It popped out of the ground like bamboo shoots!"</p>

    <p>"Sir! We have to give it a name!"</p>

    <p>"Fool!"</p>

    <p>A commander in the base shouted: "Since it popped up like bamboo shoots, let's call it a bamboo shoot monster!"</p>

    <p>"Sir! What about the signal from the armed bus that was captured earlier?"</p>

    <p>"It goes wherever it likes. The garrison is about to be demolished. Do you still have the mind to care about this?"</p>

    <p>The base commander rubbed his head with a headache.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Levis, the president of the Chilan Society, who captured this scene through a satellite telescope, and Sister Alley beside him, couldn't help but open their mouths...</p>
