  <h1>Chapter 1680 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Only those who are also at the Eternal level and have come from that era know just how powerful the Eternal-level powerhouses are.</p>

    <p>A monk has four thousand reincarnations. But the Tao practice is far more than four thousand lives. If each reincarnation lives for a hundred years, then there are 40,000 years of Tao practice. It can be said that it is a true cultivation of 40,000 years.</p>

    <p>However, only Monk Jin Deng himself knows how many specific practices there are.</p>

    <p>Even though Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were hung up and beaten by Wang Ling, it was because their opponents were Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the Supreme Corpse Map, any Eternal-level powerhouse cannot be underestimated.</p>

    <p>Take Master Wu Xin as an example. He had the ability to escape the restraints of Dao Ancestor Wang and sneak away under his nose. His strength is naturally unparalleled.</p>

    <p>As the battle continues, Nawei and the ancient god giant controlled by his divine brain become stronger and stronger as the activation of the divine brain increases. As a hostile enemy On the one hand, the Office of Strategic Deception and others cannot ignore it.</p>

    <p>Just in the next second, the Ancient God Giant changed again. Along with the brilliant light blooming from his head and eyes, blood streaks appeared all over his body. There was a certain ferocious and domineering aura that roared throughout the supreme world.</p>

    <p>This aura was so shocking that it exploded. It turned into circles of air waves that impacted everything around him, sweeping across thousands of miles. Then, fresh nerves and blood vessels condensed from these blood lines, causing his body size to skyrocket again.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, the Ancient God Giant's muscles expanded and his bones were elongated. He reached a height of one hundred feet! His body was more than a circle stronger than before. Black armor began to condense all over his body.</p>

    <p>"Pangu body protection?" Jin Deng frowned slightly. Now things seemed to be a little troublesome.</p>

    <p>He could feel that this was not the final perfection of this ancient giant.</p>

    <p>The current Nawei's divine brain activation level has only just reached 80%. He can actually form this "Pangu body protection." Under such a hegemonic body, let alone Xiang Yi's eight-thousand-year-old bullet just now. Pierce it. It's just itching.</p>

    <p>This breath was so amazing. It suddenly increased the sense of oppression brought by this supreme world. It made people feel suffocated for a while.</p>

    <p>"You two girls, be careful!" Upon seeing this, monk Jin Deng quickly protected Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi, and immediately took them into his core world.</p>

    <p>What he is most worried about is the safety of Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Because once these two people are injured.</p>

    <p>The result is terrible.</p>

    <p>It's nothing more than triggering two endings.</p>

    <p>That's the end of the world. And the destruction of the universe...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the world of the heavens, Wang Ling also felt strong fluctuations coming from another supreme world.</p>

    <p>He controls the heavens.</p>

    <p>The power of this world of heavens reaches any space in the universe. Even if you are in the world of heavens, you can easily feel the resonance from other lower spaces.</p>

    <p>He knows. This is not all of Nawei's power.</p>

    <p>As time goes by, he will become stronger.</p>

    <p>Although there are Ah Nuan and Leng Ming in the supreme world over there, they are obviously enemies that he can easily deal with. Wang Ling feels that he cannot let his sister take this risk.</p>

    <p>After all, Ah Nuan was just born not long ago.</p>

    <p>As the Lord of Shadow, she is certainly powerful, but she still has to bear some risks when dealing with map boss-level monsters.</p>

    <p>For example, hair loss and so on.</p>

    <p>If it's more serious, it might cause bruises and broken skin?</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling decided to resolve the battle under his control as soon as possible and stopped playing.</p>

    <p>Of course, the reason why he did this was not entirely for Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>After all. My birthday is coming soon.</p>

    <p>If this is not resolved, it will be postponed until the day after tomorrow...</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be a loss if you don't receive a birthday gift?</p>

    <p>Right...</p>

    <p>He didn't go there just to save Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Just to ensure that these people who can buy gifts for themselves will not get hurt.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, in the world of the heavens, a huge millstone appeared from the sky with the endless pupil power released by Wang Ling's King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>The radius of this millstone is thousands of feet. It is so shocking that people are speechless. At this moment, the sky and the earth seem to be connected. Endless thunder falls from the clouds. Electric current rushes across the millstone. There are mysterious things that people can't understand. Runes emerge from the millstone.</p>

    <p>At this moment, these nine sheltered creatures were completely stupid.</p>

    <p>They thought they could fight Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the moment the millstone offered by Wang Ling appeared that they realized that this was a match with almost no chance of winning.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the remaining nine sheltered creatures felt their eyes darken, and a sharp pain erupted from their bodies!</p>

    <p>They were shocked.</p>

    <p>I never expected that the man in front of me would have something so terrifying!</p>

    <p>--The Chaos Millstone of the Great Universe!</p>

    <p>This is the most powerful chaos weapon derived from the power of multiple avenues and the power of chaos!</p>

    <p>Back in the God's Domain, even a chaotic magic weapon with only a few percent of the chaos power could be overtaken by several Dao God family heads.</p>

    <p>As for the "Great Cosmic Chaos Millstone" presented by Wang Ling in front of me, its chaos power as a chaos weapon has reached 97%... almost approaching saturation!</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>What is the function of this Chaos Millstone?</p>

    <p>From the perspective of cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>Spell levels can be divided into levels one to fifteen.</p>

    <p>Among them, spells that exceed the tenth level can be recognized as super-level spells.</p>

    <p>This "Cosmic Chaos Grinder" is a combination of super level spells! And the lowest spell level starts at 99! The highest level is 999!</p>

    <p>That is to say. All beings targeted by the Chaos Grinder. Will be randomly selected from a minimum of 99 levels to a maximum of 999 levels of spells. One of these spells will be chosen at random by the lucky selector. And they will be punished!</p>

    <p>If you don't die directly after the punishment. Relatively. You'll be rewarded with the Chaos Grinder. Maybe you'll be elevated to the next level.</p>

    <p>But if you die... You won't even be eligible for reincarnation. You'll be destroyed.</p>

    <p>The nine sheltered creatures are all eternal creatures. They have only heard the legend about the Chaos Millstone. But they have never seen it with their own eyes! Let alone believe that such a thing actually exists in the universe!</p>

    <p>Until now, this chaotic millstone appeared in front of them.</p>

    <p>They instantly realized that their fate was over.</p>

    <p>Now. These nine sheltered creatures are aware.</p>

    <p>Just now Wang Ling has been using more than ten levels of spells. He is basically playing tricks with them...</p>

    <p>A dozen levels and a minimum level of ninety-nine. This gap is really outrageous.</p>

    <p>No matter how strong their resurrection ability is, under the bombardment of ninety-nine-level spells, they will definitely be beaten to nothing.</p>

    <p>Can you survive to receive the reward?</p>

    <p>This doesn't exist at all...</p>

    <p>Because no one has ever survived the attack of the Chaos Millstone.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is... before this Chaos Millstone launches its attack.</p>

    <p>A nice female voice actually came out of the millstone: "Congratulations. Creature No. SCB-002. You are about to be punished by a level 99 spell. The punishment spell is: Sky Burial Divine Fire. The spell will be configured in 1 second."</p>

    <p>There is no reaction time.</p>

    <p>The next second, with the gentle rotation of the chaotic millstone, a pillar of fire rose out of the sky at the foot of Number 002.</p>

    <p>For a moment, flames shot up into the sky. Hell-like red light illuminated the entire world. Number 002 was burned to ashes on the spot and became dust in the universe forever...</p>
