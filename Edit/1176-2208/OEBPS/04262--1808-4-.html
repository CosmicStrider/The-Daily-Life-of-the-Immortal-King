  <h1>Chapter 1808 Unimagined Road 4</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the critical moment, Wang Ying appeared on the shores of the Immortal Female Lake. Facing Levi's double-teamed by the Dark Wings, he took action to save him.</p>

    <p>Facing the sudden appearance of the white-haired boy, all the shadows here were stunned. They wiped their smart law enforcement mirrors. The technological means were completely ineffective in front of Wang Ying. They could not see Wang Ying clearly. That face just felt like a mass of nothingness.</p>

    <p>Someone took off the smart law enforcement mirror and tried to test it through his own spiritual power. As a result, he screamed in public, his eyes oozed blood, and he knelt on the ground.</p>

    <p>The existence that cannot be seen...</p>

    <p>This is something only a powerful person can do!</p>

    <p>For a moment, the eyes of these dark wings were straightened, and their nerves became tense. Who is this person...and why is he here?</p>

    <p>"Captain, what should we do now?" Upon seeing this, the members of Dark Wing used team communication skills to communicate. They really didn't know what to do. Wang Ying's strength was too strong. If there was a head-on confrontation, the only outcome would be death.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand, they came under the orders of Maiko Assi. The military orders were overwhelming. Levis must be brought back. If the mission fails, they will probably be punished.</p>

    <p>If we just go back unharmed, I'm afraid we'll all end up dead.</p>

    <p>After thinking again and again, the leader of the Dark Wing captain took a deep breath. He took off his smart law enforcement glasses and took out a cigarette in front of Wang Ying. After lighting it, he held the cigarette in his mouth and stared at Wang Ying: "Senior, we are here at the behest of General Maiko Assi. I hope you won't embarrass us. Otherwise it will be very difficult for us."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying narrowed his eyes and smiled. He did not answer the group's words directly. He only smiled and said: "I'll give you ten. Run away. If you don't evacuate here after my countdown, you will all die."</p>

    <p>He stared dimly at the dark wings in the sky. He was completely fearless.</p>

    <p>"Then senior, please forgive me for the offence."</p>

    <p>Captain Dark Wing took a step forward. He used hand gestures as a signal. He instantly linked the surrounding team members to form a sword formation. The immortal female lake shrouded in moonlight rippled at this moment. The spiritual light emitted by the combined sword formation was projected from the sky. It was reflected in A clear spiritual pattern disk formed on the lake surface.</p>

    <p>He didn't believe that Wang Ying would really take action against them. This was in Glio City. It was a modern cultivation city with strict discipline and cultivation laws!</p>

    <p>Publicly killing law enforcement officers in such a place. Even a powerful person would not be able to do such a thing. If it is traced later, isn't the other party's force afraid of becoming the target of public criticism?</p>

    <p>So this Dark Wing captain is betting.</p>

    <p>He bet that Wang Ying would not dare to actually kill them, so he ordered a sword formation to be formed in an attempt to compete with Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying lifted Levis up and carried him over his shoulders. Facing the thousands of sword shadows with strong murderous intent on the lake, he kept his promise.</p>

    <p>Ten...nine...eight...</p>

    <p>He kept smiling from beginning to end. It was a calm and indifferent posture. At the same time, there was an extremely penetrating and terrifying pressure. Every time he counted a number, Dark Wing could feel a wave of energy flowing on his back. The terrifying murderous intent surging in the sea of blood.</p>

    <p>Seven...</p>

    <p>Six...</p>

    <p>Five...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was still counting down. With the countdown like the bell of death, everyone was shocked. It was clear that Wang Ying was not making any moves at the moment. However, just under this countdown, they seemed to see someone behind the young man. A virtual image of a black-robed god of death.</p>

    <p>It is a skeleton creature in human form. It is tall and majestic. It is as white as jade. There is a kind of arrogance and indifference in its eye sockets. There is a kind of power that despises everything.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ying's Dharma Appearance Spirit. It is completely different from Wang Ling, which has cosmic wisdom and is extremely gentle. It is a veritable war machine! Killing! Terrifying! Ruthless! This is the Dharma Spirit of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>For a moment, there was silence on the Immortal Female Lake. Because with the appearance of this Dharma Appearance spirit, Wang Ying did not even move. The newly formed sword array in the air cracked on the spot.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>They were directly shaken by this momentum. They were so horrified that the Dark Wings were speechless.</p>

    <p>"--quick--run!"</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ying was about to count down the last three counts, the Dark Wing captain roared instantly as if he had woken up from a nightmare.</p>

    <p>He realized that this was no longer something they could contend with. It was a super-dimensional force beyond their knowledge...</p>

    <p>This determined killing intent forced the Dark Wing captain to make the decision to evacuate after Wang Ying's final three countdowns.</p>

    <p>He would rather take the blame himself than watch his young team members die like him.</p>

    <p>"It's so boring."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying snorted secretly.</p>

    <p>He thought this group of people had strong heads. Unexpectedly, he scared them away.</p>

    <p>But in fact, even if he does take action, he will pay attention to the scale and will not really kill these people. Even if he is accidentally beaten to the point of death, he will still find a way to save them.</p>

    <p>After seeing that everyone had completely evacuated, Wang Ying moved with a teleportation method and brought them to a safe place in one go.</p>

    <p>Then he slapped Levi and said, "Wake up. Stop pretending."</p>

    <p>Levis immediately opened his eyes: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying threw Levis down. Only then did Levis realize that he was at the top of the Starry Sky Tower.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, senior, for saving me..." He bowed and said to Wang Ying. Just when Wang Ying was confronting the group of dark wings, Levi's found that all his injuries were healed. It was due to Wang Ying's healing spell. Recovery. This kind of healing speed is faster than going to the hospital for treatment. It requires the output of huge spiritual power in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>But obviously, these spiritual powers are just a drop in the bucket to Wang Ying. They are not worth mentioning at all.</p>

    <p>Levis immediately determined that the person who rescued him was probably the Eternal One mentioned in the previous intelligence. According to the information in the intelligence, there are conservatively estimated to be more than a dozen Eternal Ones in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>It's just that Levi's currently doesn't know which one Wang Ying is.</p>

    <p>"Senior...is an Eternal One?" Levis asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying raised the corners of her lips and smiled: "You know a lot, don't you?"</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ying was extremely disdainful.</p>

    <p>He didn't take any of the Eternals seriously at all. From Wang Ying's perspective, most of the Eternals were rotten fish and rotten shrimps. They were not worthy of comparison with himself.</p>

    <p>"I just heard it from the information I got before." Levis smiled bitterly and said, "Honestly, I never thought that Maiko Assi would do something so absolutely...deliberately introducing the Arch Pope to me. In his courtyard, he asked me to kill the Arch Pope by mistake. Then he hunted me down in the name of law enforcement."</p>

    <p>"So now you have nowhere to go."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said: "If you want to live, you must follow our arrangements."</p>

    <p>"That's for sure, senior." Levi said solemnly.</p>

    <p>"Where is the body of the Arch Pope?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"Here. I carried it with me." Levi's took out the storage bag and took out the refrigerator.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying moved his fingers and opened the door of the refrigerator instantly. Then he took out the body of the Arch Pope from the refrigerator. Then he raised his sword fingers together, as if he was grabbing something.</p>

    <p>Levis rubbed his eyes. Then he was shocked to find that the shadow of the Arch Pope was actually extracted by the senior of the Office of Strategic Deception who rescued him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying sneered. Without saying a word, he directly injected the shadow of the Arch Pope into Levi's body.</p>

    <p>This is the "Shadow Film Assimilation Technique." You can borrow the power of the shadow to attach to another person, so that the original Number 1 shadow is covered by the designated Number 2 Shadow Film. In a short period of time, you can obtain the original owner of the Number 2 Shadow. Exactly the same memory and ability...</p>

    <p>Even the appearance will change to that of the original owner.</p>

    <p>This is a secret method derived from Shadow.</p>

    <p>In the universe, except for the brother and sister of the Wang family, there is currently no way to distinguish the authenticity.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this is also the matter in Wang ***.</p>

    <p>Now I want to keep Levi's.</p>

    <p>The best way would be for him to become the Arch Pope... and reappear before those who actually killed the Arch Pope.</p>
