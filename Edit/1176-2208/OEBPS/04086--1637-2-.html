  <h1>Chapter 1637 What did you say you did to provoke him?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling was not in a hurry to put pressure. He just raised his eyes and stared at Liu Renfeng indifferently. As a result, at this moment, Mrs. Fengchu's mind went blank.</p>

    <p>She was so shocked that she could not speak. She had no idea what was happening in front of her.</p>

    <p>I just felt that the moment I stepped into the secret realm, I felt as if I had stepped into an abyss. It was obvious that I was just being stared at by a high school-looking boy. How could she, Mrs. Fengchu, feel afraid?</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng It's hard to believe the facts in front of you.</p>

    <p>She has been pursuing the infinite secret realm for too long. Now she finally got in but was blocked by a young man. This made Liu Renfeng unable to accept this fact no matter what.</p>

    <p>"I never kill pretty boys." At this moment. Liu Renfeng stared into the air with this pressure. She opened her mouth and said.</p>

    <p>While speaking, she deliberately avoided Wang Ling's gaze.</p>

    <p>Because only in this way can she feel a little normal.</p>

    <p>Even at this moment, her body was still trembling uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can see that. Liu Renfeng actually has a back-up plan.</p>

    <p>As a well-known underground scientist at home and abroad, Mrs. Fengchu now dares to show up in her true form. She definitely did not come unprepared.</p>

    <p>The request from the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaxiu Alliance is to capture Liu Renfeng alive. Wang Ling must also pay attention to the propriety of their actions. Otherwise, they will be killed. It cannot end so easily.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling still stared at Liu Renfeng. He planned to watch the ants dance and see what kind of performance Liu Renfeng would have next.</p>

    <p>"Child, I just need the materials in this secret realm. With these materials and my skills, I can become the richest person in the world."</p>

    <p>At this moment. Liu Renfeng changed her tone. She started to take a gentle line: "If you do not block me. I can guarantee you honor and wealth for the rest of your life. You look young. You should still have a lot of things you want to buy, right? Do you want to take a look at it?"</p>

    <p>If possible. Liu Renfeng also hopes to avoid starting a war with Wang Ling here as much as possible.</p>

    <p>She doesn't know the origin of Wang Ling. She doesn't know how Wang Ling came to this infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>But the only thing that is certain is: Wang Ling is very young.</p>

    <p>On Liu Renfeng. It comes with a built-in AI intelligent analysis system.</p>

    <p>While Liu Renfeng was talking to Wang Ling, she had already scanned Wang Ling's data and found the corresponding answer from the treasury's big data.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why the photo is a mosaic...</p>

    <p>But the information does show that the boy in front of me is only in the Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p>Of course. Liu Renfeng also knows it very well. This is probably because Wang Ling is hiding his true realm.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, why would she feel such oppression?</p>

    <p>"It's really interesting... How can a sixteen-year-old boy have the same fighting power as Soul Formation?" After the initial panic, Liu Renfeng, who had obtained the data, showed a hint of excitement in his heart.</p>

    <p>A sixteen-year-old boy with the combat power of Soul Formation. If this matter is revealed, the world will be in an uproar.</p>

    <p>However, she was not prepared to reveal the matter.</p>

    <p>But I have a new strategy in mind.</p>

    <p>If so. She can trick Wang Ling. Or defeat Wang Ling here.</p>

    <p>Then cut open Wang Ling's belly. Take out Wang Ling's spiritual root and study it. Finally, use her existing artificial spiritual root core technology to recreate it.</p>

    <p>Then... not long after, she will have a group of Soul Formation's legions at her disposal!</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng The more I thought about it, the more excited I became. The corners of my mouth could not help but rise crazily.</p>

    <p>So, after a brief thought, she changed her previous offensive and planned to use the lure of profit to see if she could form a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Because after her intelligent analysis, she can be sure that Wang Ling is indeed only 16 years old.</p>

    <p>Although there are countless beauty elixirs and magical weapons in the world of cultivation nowadays, the kind of sunny aura that belongs to young people cannot be deceived.</p>

    <p>The older a cultivator is, the less "rising energy" he has.</p>

    <p>This is a special method of discernment unique to young monks.</p>

    <p>Even though he is a genius of Soul Formation, he is only 16 years old after all. She feels that Wang Ling may not be able to withstand the temptation of this colorful world with Wang Ling's state of mind.</p>

    <p>"Son, I'm old enough to be your grandma. So, I really don't want to do anything with you." Liu Renfeng said with a smile: "You should have a lot of things you want to buy, right? No matter what kind of magic weapon it is, luxury As long as you like it, I can buy it for you. In addition to these, real estate, cars, toys, beauties... If you are willing to cooperate with me, you can choose. There are also countless snacks."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing the word "snacks", Wang Ling blinked.</p>

    <p>A drop of cold sweat ran down his cheek. He thought to himself that it was terrible.</p>

    <p>I was a little shaken just now.</p>

    <p>But soon, Wang Ling regained his composure. Fortunately, he had always had a paralyzed face. Even Liu Renfeng used his own smart phone to directly scan and analyze Wang Ling's face. I can't see many subtle changes.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling has been silent for a long time. The situation at this moment has reached a deadlock again.</p>

    <p>"Don't you accept these temptations..." Liu Renfeng also found it incredible.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect Wang Ling's Taoist heart to be so stable.</p>

    <p>But when inducements failed, she had only one last option left...</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng doesn't know where Wang Ling came from.</p>

    <p>But a mere Soul Formation would stop her. It would be too underestimated for Mrs. Fengchu.</p>

    <p>"Since the negotiation failed, then, grandma, I have no choice. You are my grandson. So when grandma takes action, she will be as gentle as possible."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>While she was speaking, Liu Renfeng stretched out her hand. Then a ray of light condensed from her palm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed that Liu Renfeng had a special ring on his hand.</p>

    <p>This is a space magic weapon that uses space folding method.</p>

    <p>Unlike those storage rings, this ring can transfer items in a designated space to other spaces by shuttling and folding.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Those spaces that resonated with this space ring. At the moment when the light from the ring emanated, swirling wormholes were formed on the four walls of the void.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, countless mechanical reptiles poured out of the wormhole!</p>

    <p>These mechanical reptiles surged out of space like locusts. They spread their mechanical wings and flew in groups in the air.</p>

    <p>Just after Liu Renfeng gave a high-five, the mechanical reptiles instantly spread out and took root in the earth like raindrops.</p>

    <p>"Throwing beans makes an army." Liu Renfeng said calmly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw. These mechanical reptiles that had penetrated into the earth took root and sprouted in this brief moment!</p>

    <p>In this short period of a few seconds, countless Liu Renfeng were quickly summoned from the earth by Mrs. Fengchu's method of spreading beans into soldiers...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only estimates the number.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the number of planted artificial humans gathered in the secret realm is no less than 300,000.</p>

    <p>However, no matter how many artificial humans there are, in the eyes of Wang Ling, they are just a bunch of scrap metal.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling's expression was still calm, Liu Renfeng couldn't help but said: "I know. These artificial humans below may not be able to deal with you. But if the power of everyone can be superimposed, then it will be possible. It's different."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng had just finished speaking. She stretched out her hand and pinched it gently.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw these androids begin to transform on the spot. They held each other's hands and quickly linked together. They merged into one. They turned into a huge red mecha!</p>

    <p>And Liu Renfeng's true body has already been sitting in the more than fifty-meter-tall mecha during the transformation process.</p>

    <p>This Fire Phoenix Mecha is the proud work of Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>Using artificial spiritual roots as the medium for splicing, all attributes will be superimposed three hundred thousand times!</p>

    <p>In other words, as long as she sits in this mecha, even Lord Diulei, the strongest person on earth who has reached the True Venerated Immortal level, cannot be her opponent!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, after hearing Liu Renfeng's thoughts, Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>He had never expected that Mrs. Fengchu would be compared with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>After all, Lord Diulei is just a unit of measurement for combat power...</p>

    <p>At this time, the huge fire phoenix mecha covered the sky and the sun. It seemed like an invisible shadow covered it, enveloping Wang Ling in its entirety.</p>

    <p>Facing this mountain-like mecha, Wang Ling's mind suddenly went blank.</p>

    <p>It's not that I'm afraid.</p>

    <p>But I don't know where to start...</p>
