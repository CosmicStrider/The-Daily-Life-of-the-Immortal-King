  <h1>Chapter 1686 Sutra of Suicide</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Nuan brings the power of the shadow Dao to protect the body, the power to counter the power of the enemy is equal to the power of the master. The Way of the Shadow is an art that is capable of being strengthened when it encounters strength. There are only a few things that cannot be copied by Shadow.</p>

    <p>Although Ah Nuan is still very young, she can clearly distinguish between good and evil. Facing such an arrogant Eternal One, she can naturally feel the malice emanating from that evil god's brain.</p>

    <p>"Girl, don't look at me like that. Chaos is about to happen in the universe. If I can get the power of you, the Lord of the Great Way, you might be able to help me bring order to the chaos." At this time, Master Wu Xin was holding the rudder. Behind him was The void was constantly being annihilated and reorganized. Cracks spread out in all directions behind him like seven-colored spider webs.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan was the Lord of the Shadow Dao, and also the person that Master Wu Xin had recognized as the most difficult person to deal with in the entire room, bar none, he was indifferent as the helmsman of the universe.</p>

    <p>This Chaos Rudder is the most powerful Chaos Magic Artifact he discovered while traveling in Chaos. It has 60% of the power of Chaos... it can almost be said to be the one that instantly kills all existing Chaos Magic Artifacts!</p>

    <p>Wu Xin knew at that time that as long as he controlled the rudder of the ship, he would control the entire universe.</p>

    <p>However, at his age at that time, he was already half-footed in the grave. Even if he kept replacing his mechanized organs, it would be useless. The aging of the soul was unpreventable.</p>

    <p>Therefore, I accidentally thought of a way.</p>

    <p>That is to find a successor, then turn the inheritance ceremony of the God Brain into a scam, and finally wait for his resurrection.</p>

    <p>A fusion of a younger body, a younger soul... plus a 100% activated divine brain. Use this newly obtained body to control the rudder of chaos. It's a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>"Full right rudder!"</p>

    <p>He drank softly. The horizon of the entire supreme world rotated as he turned the rudder. It began to tilt to the right.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception stood there, their bodies unsteady.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, as the unit of measurement of combat power, was even more miserable. When the earth rolled over, his whole body came into direct contact with the Chaos Fissure. In an instant, he was swallowed up by the fissure and turned into fly ash.</p>

    <p>Then, everyone saw the fly ash transformed by Lord Diulei reorganize in front of everyone at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"As expected of a true king... His reputation as a death-seeking senior has been confirmed." Zhuo Yi felt ashamed inside.</p>

    <p>I have long heard that Wang Ling customized a set of {Book of Death} for Lord Diulei based on his characteristics. Anyway, Lord Diulei had it as a gift from him and it had already been strengthened. +999 soul-suppressing ring. No matter how severe the damage is, it will not die.</p>

    <p>This {Book of Death} is very suitable for Lord Diulei to use.</p>

    <p>It is said that every time a new method of death is unlocked, Lord Diulei's combat power will increase to a higher level based on the original.</p>

    <p>And when the fly ash that Lord Diulei turned into reorganized into a human form, his aura was indeed much better than before.</p>

    <p>"I died and became stronger!" Lord Diulei said excitedly.</p>

    <p>Then the next second.</p>

    <p>Boom! A sound!</p>

    <p>As Master Wu Xin controlled the rudder, a chaotic divine thunder fell from the sky, blasting Lord Diulei into bloody foam again...</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Don't worry about True Lord. True Lord is constantly getting stronger! We still have to find a way to destroy the rudder of this ship!" Monk Jin Deng said. His handsome and fair face was full of words. complex.</p>

    <p>He never thought that he would meet Master Wu Xin in this situation. He hadn't seen him for many years. He felt that Wu Xin had changed a lot. At least the righteous Wu Xin before was gone.</p>

    <p>The world has changed forever. It's not just the epics of the universe that have changed, but also people's hearts.</p>

    <p>"Monk, I don't know what nonsense you are talking about. You can't break the rudder of this ship. You should know it very well." Wu Xin laughed: "With these few pieces of information you have, to be honest, it's not enough for me. It can only barely be regarded as my collection."</p>

    <p>He said this. Then he quickly turned the rudder of his ship. A ripple composed of spiritual energy combined with the power of chaos emanated from the rudder and rushed from all directions.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng set up a barrier of Buddha's light to block it.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>The two ripples collided, creating waves like the vast ocean and making a violent roar.</p>

    <p>The place of impact was accompanied by the formation of a new cosmic black hole. Countless forces of chaos, thunder, and psychic energy were involved. Then a storm formed. It was extremely terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Wu Xin. The person who caused chaos in the universe is not others, but you." Monk Jin Deng frowned and said. He used the Buddha to try to hit the rudder.</p>

    <p>Wu Xin stood still and sneered after hearing the words. He saw the completely disrespectful Jin Deng monk's methods.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He struck harder. He connected his mind with the rudder of the ship in front of him. He didn't even have to raise his hand, and he felt like he was in control of everything.</p>

    <p>The monk's Buddha palm was extremely powerful. It fell from the sky. However, Master Wu Xin did not put up any defense at all. He just tilted his rudder to the right side at the moment when the palm was about to fall.</p>

    <p>As a result, the palm of Buddha seemed to be pressed on a remote control. It shifted from its original extreme direction on the spot and headed towards Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Poor Lord Diulei had just been resurrected and was turned into ashes by this palm...</p>

    <p>"It's actually possible to do this."</p>

    <p>However, everyone has no time to pay attention to the constantly resurrected "unit of measurement" at the moment. All their thoughts are on the rudder of this chaotic ship launched by Master Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that the Chaos Rudder could be so powerful. It could actually change its trajectory...</p>

    <p>If he had this rudder, Master Wu Xin would be almost invincible.</p>

    <p>However, the Buddha Divine Palm is just an ordinary magic after all. It is the most holy method of Buddhism that the monk himself understood. It has no connection with the Great Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the monk was still a bit unconvinced.</p>

    <p>The second palm of Buddha struck quickly towards Master Wu Xin!</p>

    <p>And this time, this palm contains the power of a thousand Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng didn't believe it. With the blessing of Heavenly Dao's power, this palm could still be controlled by this weird rudder.</p>

    <p>However, the result was once again beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

    <p>That rudder was so weird. During its operation, a trace of the terrifying aura of the first Hongmeng emerged. The powerful energy of chaos was as vast as a sea of smoke. It flooded the entire supreme world on the spot!</p>

    <p>Before Monk Jin Deng's second palm struck, it was changed in trajectory and headed towards Wang Nuan's strike over there!</p>

    <p>And!</p>

    <p>This palm actually became stronger in the process of changing its trajectory!</p>

    <p>"How could this be..."</p>

    <p>The power of this rudder has exceeded everyone's expectations</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Nuan was about to launch a defensive stance, a familiar figure suddenly appeared and stood in front of Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>I saw that the man slowly squatted down, picked up Ah Nuan girl with one hand, and put it on his shoulder very skillfully. And Ah Nuan girl was like a pendant, lying on her stomach obediently.</p>

    <p>The movement was extremely slow. Slow enough that everyone could clearly see every movement of this man. But at the same time, it was incredibly fast.</p>

    <p>In the next second, the man came back to his senses. He breathed forward gently and reflected the Buddha Palm, which was turned back and strengthened by the steering of the ship, back with 1000% power...</p>
