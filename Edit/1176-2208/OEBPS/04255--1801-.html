  <h1>Chapter 1801 Forming a group to cheat</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Guo Hao felt tired just by receiving Maiko Abei. The most important thing was that he was despised by Maiko Abei... Although it was not that Guo Hao didn't know what his problem was. Even if he was a little fatter. But he didn't eat the rice that was added! What's wrong with being a little fatter?</p>

    <p>"Don't take it too seriously... it's a blessing to be able to eat." Forced to do so, Li Youyue could only comfort him from a girl's perspective: "You have to believe that you are a flexible fat man!"</p>

    <p>He didn't know why these words sounded good. But Guo Hao felt that the blow to him was even greater.</p>

    <p>After all, it's not his fault that he's fat. It's mainly a genetic problem. Almost 80% of his uncles' weight is calculated by the ton. He can't be blamed for this.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, Guo. Let's look at mine next." Chen Chao saw Guo Hao's uncomfortable look. Naturally, as a brother, he couldn't bear it. He took the initiative to step forward and take over the identity of the temporary Gray Cult leader.</p>

    <p>At this moment, another voice sounded outside the suite door.</p>

    <p>"Hello. My name is Pei Xiaoyuan. I'm here... to see the leader of Gray Cult!"</p>

    <p>It was the voice of a boy about fourteen years old. The slightly hoarse and extremely childish voice fully demonstrated that the boy was in the period of voice change that is common among teenagers.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue stepped forward and opened the door. A young man with short black ear-length hair and a long braid hanging from the back of his head. He had fair skin and a pair of conspicuous ears. He immediately walked in like an elf.</p>

    <p>He was wearing dark purple clothes, thin stockings and a pair of black leather shoes. At first glance, they could tell that he was dressed like a child from a wealthy family in Glio City. The nobility exuding from his body came to the fore. It made people feel proud. A feeling that can be viewed from a distance but not played with.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was sitting on the sofa. Behind him was a row of people from Number 60 High School. He held his chin with his fingers crossed. He looked at the elf-like boy in front of him. His tone was pretending to be low: "Hello. I am the leader of Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>"Eh? You are actually the leader of Gray Cult?" Just like Maiko Abei before. After learning that Chen Chao was the leader of Gray Cult, Pei Xiaoyuan's slightly surprised face revealed a little bit of disappointment.</p>

    <p>"Why. Are you disappointed to see that the leader of Gray Cult is a man? Do you think that the leader of Gray Cult is a big sister? Do you still want to have a vigorous love affair with the leader of Gray Cult?" Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>He was making random nonsense. As a result, Pei Xiaoyuan became red-faced on the spot. Chen Chao's words hit his heart on the spot and he was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Where... there is no way! I have no intention of falling in love with the leader of Gray Cult! Let alone the idea of pursuing her!" Pei Xiaoyuan became anxious and retorted directly.</p>

    <p>Such a reaction made everyone at Number 60 High School, including Wang Ling, suddenly feel like thunder. Even Sun Rong, who was secretly observing in the room, slapped her face. She was shocked in her heart.</p>

    <p>Look at this reaction...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he just wants to fall in love with the leader of Gray Cult!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao just didn't want to make the same mistake as Guo Hao. Therefore, he decided to strike preemptively the moment the boy entered the room. Unexpectedly, he unintentionally hit the boy's mind.</p>

    <p>"You are young and don't study hard. You don't think about these things. Are you fully developed? You just want to fall in love with a girl who is older than you?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao smiled and said: "Children, studying hard now is the right way. There is no future if you mature too early. If you do this, your father will be very disappointed."</p>

    <p>"He can be disappointed if he wants to be, I don't want him to be disappointed more!" Pei Xiaoyuan said in dissatisfaction, "That guy, he's not at home all day! That's why I decided to find a woman to get married and secretly have a child to directly surprise him! As long as he has grandchildren, I'm afraid he won't have time to work, so he can stay home all day and help me bring up my children!"</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan gritted his teeth and said, "I have always dreamed of one day being able to put my father in a cage with my own hands! He has no idea how hard my mother and I live!"</p>

    <p>When everyone at Number 60 High School heard this, they all gasped: "..."</p>

    <p>Why are today's children so extreme...</p>

    <p>Isn't this considered a brace?</p>

    <p>Why do you always like to put your father in a cage and raise him?</p>

    <p>In fact, after Maiko Abei and Pei Xiaoyuan's "scoring twice", Wang Muyu actually had similar thoughts in his heart... But it was a pity. He felt that he couldn't beat Wang Ling with his current strength. Not to mention putting his father in a cage. It's good that he wasn't sent over and locked up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Xiaoyuan, what you are doing is definitely wrong in the first place. If you want to cause trouble for your father, just carry out our Gray Cult mission secretly." Chen Chao said: "From your description, your father is obsessed with work all day long. He must be a big shot, right?"</p>

    <p>"What a big shot. He is a team leader of the Heavenly Dao Alliance." Pei Xiaoyuan spread his hands.</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, the expressions of everyone at Number 60 High School changed instantly.</p>

    <p>The first person to come was Maiko Abei, the daughter of General Maiko Assi...</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan who is here now is actually the son of a team leader in the Heavenly Dao League...</p>

    <p>A positioning coordinate. Actually developed two such outstanding undercover insiders?</p>

    <p>Everyone at Number 60 High School couldn't believe that this was true.</p>

    <p>Everything went so smoothly. It was like a miracle!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also a little confused in the room. She initially suspected that it was probably the senior named Qin Zhong who sent a wave of luck in their direction... and this was the legendary Purple Qi from the East. ah!</p>

    <p>But it is obvious that Pei Luoqi is very secretive about the nature of his work. As a result, Pei Xiaoyuan has no idea what Pei Luoqi does.</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan gave a helpless smile and said, "I don't know what my father does in that inexplicable organization. He can be so happy as a team leader. Isn't he just a collector of homework?"</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling couldn't help but shed a drop of cold sweat on his forehead.</p>

    <p>It's okay to collect homework...</p>

    <p>Given the nature of the work of the Heavenly Dao Alliance, the meaning behind this job is that it is just a loss.</p>

    <p>"So. Do you think there's anything unusual about your father recently?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao asked: "No matter how small the information is."</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan thought carefully for a moment, and then said: "That's right! I remembered... Uh, it doesn't seem right. I don't know if this matter has anything to do with my father."</p>

    <p>"Let's hear it." Chen Chao smiled.</p>

    <p>"It's like this. I found that every time my father left home, the Arch Pope of St. Peter's Basilica would come to my house to preach."</p>

    <p>"Preach?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan nodded and said: "The Pope said, my father is away from home all day because there are evil things in the house. So he brought a cross and holy water. Every time, he and my mother had to work together for a while before he came out..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
