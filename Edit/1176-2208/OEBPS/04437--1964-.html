  <h1>Chapter 1964: All laws are within range</h1>

  <div>

    <p>All Taoist techniques in the world are branches of Heavenly Dao. No matter how profound and mysterious they are, as long as you master the relevant Heavenly Dao, you can easily analyze the principles behind the techniques.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling holds a total of 30,000 Heavenly Dao in ten universes. Therefore, all Taoisms are within the range of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Jinghong Giant Arrow. Wang Ling has never learned it before. But as long as he has seen it once, or even listened to someone describe the relevant data of the spell, it is not difficult for Wang Ling to reproduce it.</p>

    <p>Luo Lan, a tenth-level mist practitioner, comes from Shuangbi District, Shuangxi City. He is also one of the model cultivators who was awarded the honorary title of "City Hero" for fighting against the invasion of the demon world many years ago.</p>

    <p>Such an obscure and unpopular fog method is very difficult to imitate in the eyes of others. Wang Ling not only has to imitate it, but also uses Li Changzhe's hands to imitate Luo Lan's feeling. It sounds impossible to normal practitioners.</p>

    <p>"Master, have you listened clearly to Luo Lan's information?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice of Zhuo Yi came from Wang Ling's ears.</p>

    <p>His electronic bracelet was originally issued by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>With the contact point deliberately set up by Wang Ming, the data needed by Wang Ling can be easily passed on through other insiders at the first time.</p>

    <p>So in fact, in the Jiutian Jingmi Academy Command Center, Teng Luchen and others are closely monitoring the other side of the screen. The Office of Strategic Deception command center is also monitoring this battle simultaneously. And promptly provide Wang Ling with the necessary information. The data is fed back in place.</p>

    <p>"The art of clearing the mist."</p>

    <p>After receiving clear data feedback, Wang Ling's mind suddenly became much clearer. At the same time, he was glad that he patiently listened to the data given by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would be a bit too much to just copy the "Mist Resolving Technique." Luo Lan's Mist Resolving Technique is not as strong as he thought. Although the gimmick is very good...</p>

    <p>The art of mist-resolving is just an ordinary fourth-level spell.</p>

    <p>It is not easy for Li Changzhe to have just entered the third level at this age. If he wants to continue to the next level, it will take decades to repair.</p>

    <p>However, it is a fourth-level spell. If he practice it to the top level, it will still play a huge role on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>Luo Lan is famous because he has cultivated this fourth-level spell to the tenth level. He is also known by a special title: Water Mist Mirror Flower.</p>

    <p>Under the state of water mist, the atomization state of the human body can last up to an hour! Not only that. In such a special atomization state, part of the atomized body can also be transformed into an entity for attack, thus achieving an unprepared attack. It is impossible to predict the effectiveness of defense.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling did his homework on Li Changzhe. He knew very well that Li Changzhe's biggest idol was "Luo Lan."</p>

    <p>And now, if Li Changzhe really has a hidden identity, there is a very high possibility that he is Luo Lan's disciple.</p>

    <p>This made Qu Shuling feel a little shaken for a brief moment. As a lonely genius, he didn't want to accept this unimaginable result...</p>

    <p>He has been practicing alone in solitude since he was a child. He gradually explored to become the person he is today. He never received help from anyone. All the resources he obtained were obtained after he gradually climbed up to the first throne of this "genius." It comes from hard work.</p>

    <p>There was a time when Qu Shuling also longed for how good it would be to have a master who could accompany him on the road of spiritual cultivation.</p>

    <p>But now, as he gradually got used to the path of cultivation alone, he was suddenly shocked to find that those people around him who were also dubbed "elites" and "geniuses" actually had masters!</p>

    <p>"You also have a master. Li Changzhe..." Qu Shuling's eyes turned red. He held Zhanye with one hand and fought fiercely with Li Changzhe. The sword blade cut and sparks shot out.</p>

    <p>"Where do I have a master? Brother Qu... you should calm down a little bit. I feel a little unconscious." Li Changzhe spoke incoherently. He didn't know how to explain to Qu Shuling that he really didn't have a master.</p>

    <p>Even if there is, his master must be Luo Lan. But who is Luo Lan... one of the city's heroes! He is a legendary casual cultivator who was awarded the same honorary title as Zhuo Yi of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>How easy is it to have such a person as your teacher?</p>

    <p>Moreover, Luo Lan also said back then that if he wanted to recruit a disciple, that person's "Mist Resolving Technique" would have to be at least at the sixth level before he could be qualified to be his disciple.</p>

    <p>Where he is now, he's only three levels...</p>

    <p>To cultivate to the state of Luo Lan's "Water Mist Mirror Flower" is completely nonsense!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe felt extremely wronged. He was not good at close combat. What he was better at was using the "Mist Resolving Technique" to carry out guerrilla attacks. He used harassment to wear down the opponent's physical strength, and then seized the opportunity to win with one move.</p>

    <p>But the ones who can conquer Shuling are almost Hexagonal warriors. In such an injured state, his physical strength is still astonishing and terrifying. Li Changzhe feels that he will definitely lose if he continues like this.</p>

    <p>"The Art of Mist Removal!"</p>

    <p>In desperation, he had to use his special skill again to divide himself into a ball of mist. Through the state of mist dissolution, he got a chance to rest and recover some physical strength.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the duration of the "Mist Resolving Technique" of the Third Heaven will not exceed 3 minutes. This is the longest time Li Changzhe has ever had before. If the spiritual power is depleted, the duration of 1 minute is already the limit.</p>

    <p>Hidden in the state of the Mist Resolving Technique, Li Changzhe was trying to think of countermeasures. He could not continue to fight with Qu Shuling like this. He must seize the opportunity to send Qu Shuling away after the next materialization.</p>

    <p>However, what surprised Li Changzhe was...</p>

    <p>This time, his mist-resolving technique seems to have never come to an end...</p>

    <p>Three minutes...</p>

    <p>Four minutes...</p>

    <p>Six minutes...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was completely shocked. He estimated the time it took him to use the Mist Resolving Technique. It actually far exceeded the limit he had used this method before!</p>

    <p>This... what's going on?</p>

    <p>He couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>Even Qu Shuling was a little impatient: "How long are you going to hide in this fog! Come out and fight me!"</p>

    <p>Six minutes passed. Li Changzhe's heart rate had completely recovered. Only Qu Shuling's slightly miserable roar was left in the center of the silent battlefield.</p>

    <p>"What the hell..." Li Changzhe was surprised. His mist-resolving technique had lasted for more than ten minutes. According to the normal level of magic, this was at least the fifth level of magic.</p>

    <p>Could it be that my mist-resolving technique has also been used beyond normal?</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe somehow felt that he was in particularly good condition at the moment.</p>

    <p>He was secretly horrified. In this state of mist-resolving technique, he tentatively punched Qu Shuling in the face.</p>

    <p>When the atomized fist approached Qu Shuling's cheek, part of the atomized fist solidified directly at the moment of approach. It briefly changed into an entity!</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A scene that made everyone unbelievable happened.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe's punch hit Qu Shuling's right cheek firmly, leaving him no time to react. He was beaten away on the spot...</p>

    <p>In front of the monitor, Teng Luchen couldn't sit still at all. He stood up on the spot and exclaimed, "It's the tenth level of Mist Resolving Technique! Water Mist Mirror Flower! I guessed it right. He is Luo Lan's disciple!"</p>
