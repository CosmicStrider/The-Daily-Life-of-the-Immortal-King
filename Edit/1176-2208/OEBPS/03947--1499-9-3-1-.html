  <h1>Chapter 1499 A restless night at the 9th Palace House</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This kiss lasted extremely long.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how much time passed before the two of them separated with blushing faces.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming put his arms around Zhai Yin's slender waist and buried his head deep in Zhai Yin's shoulder. He tasted it greedily and smelled the scent that belongs only to a girl.</p>

    <p>"Yinzi..." He couldn't help but hold her tighter. His voice when calling Zhai Yin was trembling.</p>

    <p>But now Wang Ming only feels regret. He regrets that he did not hold Zhai Yin earlier.</p>

    <p>Obviously he likes her so much...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's whisper in his ear suddenly made Zhai Yin feel a sore nose.</p>

    <p>She tried hard not to let her tears fall down so unsatisfactoryly.</p>

    <p>Let Wang Ming hug him so tightly.</p>

    <p>This situation is extremely unfamiliar but feels like it has been dreamed about countless times in dreams.</p>

    <p>Make Zhai Yin extremely sentimental.</p>

    <p>She reached out and stroked Wang Ming's hair. She couldn't help but laugh: "Others say you are the most powerful brain. But why do I think you are a fool?"</p>

    <p>"I have the strongest brain. It is precisely because of this that I always think too much."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming slowly let go of Zhai Yin and moved his face closer. The distance between him and Zhai Yin was less than an inch. The tips of their noses were almost touching.</p>

    <p>"In the past, I worked hard to design mechas, arm myself fully, and become stronger... Actually, I wanted to get rid of you. As long as I am strong enough, there is no reason for you to stay with me..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled bitterly and said: "But now I find that no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get rid of you."</p>

    <p>"You really don't need my protection now."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin naturally rubbed the host Wang Ming's neck: "So I give you this opportunity. Come and protect me."</p>

    <p>"You are a bodyguard. Do you still need someone to protect you?" Wang Ming couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"Why? Don't want to?"</p>

    <p>"Yes...of course I am willing..." Wang Ming was very happy.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhai Yin suddenly said something that made Wang Ming almost laugh out loud: "Anyway, in the past, you always focused on your brother. In fact, there was a period of time when I was particularly skeptical about whether or not there was an intimate relationship between you and your brother..."</p>

    <p>"What kind of relationship?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suppressed a laugh: "What else can my brother and I do? Bayonet each other?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's face was instantly on fire, burning to the base of his ears: "You gangster...you want all these things..."</p>

    <p>"There is indeed something going on between my brother and I. But it's not what you think."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming gently stroked Zhai Yin's soft earlobe and said frankly: "It's not the time to tell you now. When the right opportunity comes, you will definitely know. But what I must tell you is... He is indeed someone I cherish very much."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin responded: "eh..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming stared at the girl in front of him with tender eyes: "And now, there is one more person I cherish."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhai Yin suddenly hugged Wang Ming again: "I will wait for you to tell me."</p>

    <p>"I won't keep you waiting too long. Yinzi..."</p>

    <p>"In exchange, when you tell me, I will tell you another secret about me." Zhai Yin's face was hot.</p>

    <p>"Your own secret?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was suddenly shocked: "Don't tell me. You are actually a man. You are bigger than me..."</p>

    <p>"Please stop thinking blindly..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin laughed out loud.</p>

    <p>This guy is always so crooked...</p>

    <p>Afterwards, the two returned hand in hand. On the way back, Wang Ming suddenly came up with a spiritual thought.</p>

    <p>"Tell me, the room Jiugong's family has arranged for the night. Is the sound insulation strong? If the sound insulation is not strong, I think it is okay to turn on the magnetic shield."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Just asking."</p>

    <p>"We still have a mission. Don't act recklessly..."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. His heart blossomed with joy.</p>

    <p>In fact, the previous few sentences were testing Zhai Yin's attitude.</p>

    <p>As long as there is no rejection, that means there is a chance.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this has to take into account the issue of realm surprise...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's current combat power comes from mechas. It is impossible to wear a mecha and do shameful things with Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>He could tell that because of his strange state of mind, Zhai Yin didn't dare to kiss too hard just now.</p>

    <p>After all, there had been a passionate kiss between a high-level cultivator and a low-level cultivator before, resulting in the tongue being sucked out...</p>

    <p>But this matter is actually easy to handle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that he needed to obtain the enlightenment technique from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just make your physical body stronger.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling A group of people waited in front of Jiugong's house for a long time.</p>

    <p>Only then did he see the two people, who had been lying under the tree for half an hour, coming back from a distance with red faces.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. It took us a while." Zhai Yin bowed and apologized.</p>

    <p>In order to avoid suspicion, the two of them are not holding hands now. They still have some room to be reserved in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>But in fact, what happened between the two of them under the tree just now...</p>

    <p>In addition to Yingxian Heming. Wang Ling, Sun Rong and monk Jin Deng. They all saw it...</p>

    <p>Sometimes the people we travel with are too powerful, which really makes people feel helpless.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming had an unsurprised expression on his face. He had a humble attitude. Then he walked at the front to lead the way, leading everyone into the Jiugong family, which was like an ancient palace: "Our Jiugong family has arranged a residence. Today, I would like to invite everyone first. Check in at Jiugong's house."</p>

    <p>Their current location is still in the outer courtyard of Jiugong's house. Wang Ling just scanned it with King's Eyes and learned the entire map of Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>As expected, the Jiugong family is so big that it is like a country on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling can tell from the layout of each building in Jiugong's house at just one glance.</p>

    <p>A profound formation knowledge is used here.</p>

    <p>The person responsible for designing the architectural layout for the entire Jiugong family. He is 100% a master of formations and Feng Shui.</p>

    <p>Walking on the road marked with the Jiugong family's crow seal. Wang Ling was also thinking in his mind at the same time.</p>

    <p>He had a rough idea of why the Jiugong family was laid out the way it was.</p>

    <p>It is probably closely related to the secret room deep underground where the {Ghost Book} is sealed.</p>

    <p>This formation layout of the Jiugong family exists to protect the main book of {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>The mobile secret room underground will also change its location every day according to the "dynamic lock password" set by Jiugong's family.</p>

    <p>However, this kind of saving is meaningless in Wang Ling's own opinion.</p>

    <p>Because cracking passwords is very troublesome.</p>

    <p>He can reach deep underground with just one punch...</p>

    <p>Along the way. Wang Ling observed the layout of Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>What Sun Rong is concerned about is the dynamic between Wang Ming and Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>There was a smile on her face. Finally, she couldn't help but stepped forward and gently tapped Wang Ming's shoulder with her finger. Then she whispered: "Congratulations, brother Xiaoer."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stunned. He couldn't help but laugh: "Is it that obvious?"</p>

    <p>"Of course..." Sun Rong nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>Honestly. Congratulations. Congratulations.</p>

    <p>But the sour smell of love makes Sun Rong jealous...</p>

    <p>She looked at the background of Wang Ling in front of her. The sense of distance and helplessness in her heart suddenly came back to her.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin looked at Sun Rong's depressed face. Suddenly, she felt touched in her heart.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, she felt that Sun Rong was very similar to herself.</p>

    <p>The difference lies in the object they pursue. There is an essential difference in "material."</p>

    <p>One is wood. The other is not...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Zhai Yin couldn't help but stepped forward and took Sun Rong's arm.</p>

    <p>She smiled at Sun Rong: "Shall we share a room tonight?"</p>

    <p>The spring smile gave Sun Rong some comfort.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin whispered in the girl's ear: "We both had unrequited love at first. Maybe I can tell you some experience?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's eyes lit up immediately after hearing these words.</p>

    <p>She was so happy. She quickly thanked her: "Thank you for..."</p>

    <p>When the words came to my lips, I realized that I seemed to have spilled the beans.</p>

    <p>Although Yingxian Heming was walking at the front, he could still hear what Sun Rong was saying.</p>

    <p>But fortunately Sun Rong responded quickly. He quickly sang: "Because of love. I will not be sad easily..."</p>

    <p>"So everything is happy" Zhai Yin sang from behind very cooperatively.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ming, Monk Jin Deng: "..."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Sister Yinzi."</p>

    <p>After successfully fooling him, for the second time, Sun Rong carefully chose Transmission.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome." Zhai Yin responded.</p>

    <p>Then the two women held hands and walked in front of them very naturally.</p>

    <p>This situation made Wang Ming sigh from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>The friendship between these women is really simple...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiugong's house is too big inside. Yingxian Heming led Wang Ling them all the way to several pavilions.</p>

    <p>The pavilion is the location of the transfer circle inside Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>They turned around for no less than sixteen magic circles before arriving at the entrance of Yingxian Heming's mansion arranged in advance.</p>

    <p>The name of this mansion is "Yuedu Guan."</p>

    <p>According to Yingxian Heming, this is the Jiugong family's special hall for entertaining distinguished guests.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this name sounds a bit familiar. It seems like I have heard it somewhere.</p>

    <p>"The meaning of Yuedu actually has no other meaning." Yingxian Heming led the crowd and explained: "The actual meaning of Yuedu is: don't forget to vote for the monthly ticket while studying."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>It's time to check in.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming arranged a total of three upper rooms.</p>

    <p>All are equipped with presidential suites.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>Then Monk Jin Deng lived in a separate room.</p>

    <p>When the room assignment was completed, Wang Ming's face was obviously not in a high mood.</p>

    <p>When Monk Jin Deng saw this, he just smiled. He directly sent a message to Wang Ming: "I think Mr. Ming needs a skill very much."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "?"</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng: "I have a method called Qi Ding Shen Xian. Those who learn it can automatically enter the sage mode and eliminate all female sexual attraction. In addition, this method also has the effect of tonifying the kidneys and strengthening yang."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was surprised. He was about to ask why it had the effect of tonifying the kidneys and strengthening yang. But he saw monk Jin Deng exclaiming: "As time goes by, if you don't get close to women, you will naturally feel better. Stocking up more is actually good for fertility." Monk, I have stored up several reincarnations."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ming involuntarily took two steps back.</p>

    <p>He thought this monk was a bit scary...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Overall, the arrangements made by the Jiugong family can be said to be appropriate and perfect. All receptions are of the highest standard.</p>

    <p>This can actually be seen from Yingxian Heming, the foreign affairs liaison chief.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family actually has many foreign affairs liaison officers. Yingxian Heming is the boss of these foreign affairs officers. Generally, he will not show up easily except for specially entertained VIPs.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Jiugong Liangzi still has face in the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>And Yingxian Heming actually supports Jiugong Liangzi's group.</p>

    <p>After all the arrangements were completed, the first thing Yingxian Heming did was to call Jiugong Liangzi: "Ms. Liangzi, I have made all arrangements for the distinguished guests from Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, Uncle Ying."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming has never been careless in her work. She has always been reliable and made her feel at ease.</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way. What are they eating for dinner?"</p>

    <p>"Ms. Liangzi, please rest assured about this. I have dispatched several experts from the Jiugong family. They are all famous chefs. They plan to cook some of our local specialties tonight. They will definitely satisfy the guests."</p>

    <p>"That's good."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded. She was silent for a moment. Then she asked the last question: "By the way, Uncle Ying. I asked you to do something before..."</p>

    <p>"Is it about Madam Six?"</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming said: "Everything is as expected by the lady. After I told Mrs. Six about the exchange student plan, Mrs. Six's first reaction was to go to Tianxuan Temple to pray."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Uncle Ying. If there is any movement from her in the future, please tell me."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Miss."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming nodded solemnly and then terminated the call.</p>

    <p>At this moment. Zhuo Yi is beside Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>"It's so hot, Liangzi. It's so hot inside."</p>

    <p>"If you feel it's too hot, just go out..."</p>

    <p>"Then I think I can still hold on for a while."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "I see you are sweating. Your whole body is soaked."</p>

    <p>"I want you to take care of..."</p>

    <p>Hearing the word "wet", Jiugong Liangzi glanced at the clothes on his body subconsciously.</p>

    <p>Eh...the fabric is quite thick. There is no possibility of penetration. It is very safe.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the girl in front of him with a pity expression: "However, I still don't understand why you chose this place? Can't you go to my house?"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to go to your house..." Jiugong Liangzi rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>In fact, she and Zhuo Yi were steaming in a steam room.</p>

    <p>The appointment was proposed by Zhuo Yi. Today is Wang Ling's first day on Sun Island. There are many things to do on the itinerary. As well as some points to pay attention to when staying at Jiugong's home. Zhuo Yi feels It is necessary to discuss it together.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to invite Jiugong Liangzi to his home.</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Liangzi went back last night, Zhuo Yi got up early and bought a lot of vegetables. He was going to show off his skills to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>To capture someone's heart.</p>

    <p>Then. You must first capture a person's stomach.</p>

    <p>This is the strategy for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But what Zhuo Yi didn't expect was that the girl actually rejected his request.</p>

    <p>Instead, they invited him to such a public place.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Zhuo Yi felt that Jiugong Liangzi was deliberately keeping a distance from himself. He was planning to use this tactful way to peel off the relationship with him bit by bit.</p>

    <p>We can still meet at the steam center.</p>

    <p>What about the future?</p>

    <p>Maybe they will just find an excuse to reject themselves.</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiI don't know what Jiugong Liangzi is afraid of.</p>

    <p>But now, this little girl is still trying to get rid of him...</p>

    <p>Don't even think about this. And there is absolutely no possibility of negotiation!</p>

    <p>The road to pursuing happiness is arduous. He has actually confirmed Jiugong Liangzi's feelings for him. Then it is even more impossible to give up.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you need to be thicker-skinned.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was the high temperature in the steam room. Or maybe it was the burning gaze of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt that the temperature in this steam room seemed to be higher than expected.</p>

    <p>She quickly covered her head with a towel and then stood up. She only said "I'm out." She quickly opened the door and walked out.</p>

    <p>Fresh air finally allowed Jiugong Liangzi to calm down again.</p>

    <p>The hot water droplets condense the sweat discharged from the skin and evaporate little by little with the water vapor.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi hurriedly followed from behind. He was also covered in smoke: "Why don't you steam it for a while?"</p>

    <p>"It's because of you..." Jiugong Liangzi silently rolled her eyes again.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi This old dirty turtle. He has been saying ambiguous words since he started sweating.</p>

    <p>These words may sound fine at first glance.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi is not stupid either.</p>

    <p>Her waist almost broke when she heard it!</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with me?" Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"Humph...you know it yourself!" Jiugong Liangzi stretched out his finger and poked Zhuo Yi's heart hard. Then he turned around.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi grabbed her wrist: "Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I'm going home." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"Go home? What time this time? And you invited me here."</p>

    <p>"The purpose of our meeting is just to discuss the first day they went to Jiugong's house. You just heard it. They are in good condition now. We don't need to worry about it."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi sighed and replied patiently: "So now we go back to our respective homes to find our respective mothers."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi. Excuse me, are you hiding from me?" Zhuo Yi looked at Jiugong Liangzi intently.</p>

    <p>He did not let go of the girl's hand, but very carefully controlled the force on his hand. He did not want to squeeze the girl's hand in pain.</p>

    <p>"If I avoid you, will I ask you out...Don't think too much..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the expression on Jiugong Liangzi's face darkened.</p>

    <p>She originally wanted to explain something directly to Zhuo Yi. But she found that she seemed to be unable to explain everything clearly with only a few words.</p>

    <p>What was beyond Jiugong Liangzi's expectation was.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Zhuo Yi actually let her hand go.</p>

    <p>The moment the temperature on his wrist disappeared, Jiugong Liangzi felt as if his heart was twitched by something.</p>

    <p>She was frozen in place. And Zhuo Yi just looked at her.</p>

    <p>The expression on the young man's face no longer held a smile. Instead, he looked a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>"I understand, Classmate Liangzi. If you want to go back, I won't stop you. Anyway, I am just a tool to you, Classmate Liangzi."</p>

    <p>Saying that, Zhuo Yi turned around, as if he was about to leave.</p>

    <p>On the surface, he looked really disappointed. He felt like he was about to burst into tears.</p>

    <p>But in fact, when Zhuo Yi turned around, Zhuo Yi was also panicking inside.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether his "play hard to get" trick would work.</p>

    <p>One step, two steps... He walked towards the men's locker room.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent Jiugong Liangzi from seeing his true thoughts. Zhuo Yi deliberately walked very fast. He was more decisive than Jiugong Liangzi thought.</p>

    <p>Now, Jiugong Liangzi finally couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>She took three steps at a time and stepped forward to grab Zhuo Yi's hand: "Zhuo Yi wait! Please speak clearly..."</p>

    <p>"Not enough. Are you clear?" Zhuo Yi resisted the urge to turn around and hug the girl.</p>

    <p>The moment Jiugong Liangzi's hand grabbed his. Zhuo Yi felt almost ecstatic inside.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi held back tears in his eyes: "I have never regarded you as a tool..."</p>

    <p>"So. Are we friends?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi turned around and faced her.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said without thinking: "Of course!"</p>

    <p>"Since we are friends, you shouldn't have any scruples."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled again: "Let's go to my house for dinner tonight. I bought a lot of vegetables."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath: "Okay..."</p>

    <p>It was only then that the girl suddenly realized that she seemed to have been tricked by Zhuo Yi again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the evening. After finishing the meal, Wang Ling returns to the room.</p>

    <p>Before going to bed, Wang Ling deliberately wrapped himself tightly in the quilt. Like a silkworm chrysalis. The corners of the quilt were rolled inwards. There was no gap at all.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling? Are you asleep?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming came out of the shower. She was smelling of high-end body wash.</p>

    <p>This greeting immediately gave Wang Ling a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>The three houses arranged by the Jiugong family are all configured as presidential suites. They are very spacious. There are two independent bedrooms.</p>

    <p>And every bedroom has a large bed.</p>

    <p>The only pity is that all the doors here are controlled by the system. For a professional intruder like Wang Ming, even if Wang Ling sets a password in advance, it will be useless.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming only took a few seconds to crack the password and walked in directly.</p>

    <p>Because of my understanding of Wang Ming, Wang Ling actually expected that Wang Ming would come over, and insisted on sleeping with him.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Ling Ling. Why are you so nervous? It makes me feel perverted."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming came up to her so shamelessly: "I can tell you, I have a girlfriend now."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly despised him in his heart.</p>

    <p>Now that you have a girlfriend, why don't you pay attention to avoiding suspicion?</p>

    <p>Why are you joining in the fun...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't cover herself with a quilt either. She just lay next to him and said thoughtfully: "I have something to discuss with you tonight. Of course! The main thing is to ask you..."</p>

    <p>"You said..."</p>

    <p>From the gap, Wang Ling got his head out. It was concise and concise. It was so cute that it made people laugh.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled. Then he connected the quilt on Wang Ling like a koala and hugged Wang Ling directly: "You should know what happened between me and your sister Yinzi today. If nothing else happens, this will be your sister-in-law from now on."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So I was thinking about Ling Ling. Should I also show my cards to Yinzi?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "She is very jealous. If we can show off her cards earlier, I will study Talisman for you in the laboratory. There will be no need to be secretive."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, what Wang Ming said was actually a serious matter worthy of discussion.</p>

    <p>But about this matter. Wang Ling has not thought about it yet.</p>

    <p>So. He sent a message to Wang Ming and said: "I understand."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded with satisfaction: "Okay. With your words, I feel relieved. You can look back and find the right time. I'm actually not in a hurry."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling answered perfunctorily.</p>

    <p>He thought Wang Ming had finished speaking and was leaving.</p>

    <p>It turned out that this girl still had no intention of moving away.</p>

    <p>Those cold feet were like loaches burrowing into his bed: "Ling Ling, it's cold today. It's too hot for me to lie down here... How about we squeeze in tonight?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay if you don't squeeze me. As long as you do the second thing for me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said. Light radiates from his pupils: "Why don't you help my physical body. Why don't you enlighten some of it? As you know, there is still a gap between my actual level and that of your Sister Zhai Yin. There are many things. It's not convenient to do. The realm hinders our imagination to create new life."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
