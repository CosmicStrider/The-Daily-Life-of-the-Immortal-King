  <h1>Chapter 1847 The connection of fate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong and You Yueqing discussed for more than an hour how to help Wang Ling better protect themselves. The friendship between girls is sometimes so wonderful. After having a common goal, the two of them feel that the distance between them seems to have become much closer.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong also felt that You Yueqing was not as dangerous as she had seen before.</p>

    <p>However, she still didn't completely let down her guard.</p>

    <p>Even after the conversation, You Yueqing started to use the camera to play the video footage of Sun Rong that the two of them had celebrated their birthday together when they were children. This made Sun Rong extremely envious.</p>

    <p>Although she has never seen Wang Ling as a child at Wang Ling's house before. But in the video, little Wang Ling can move! This makes Sun Rong ecstatic.</p>

    <p>Little Wang Ling is so cute. Her smiling little face was full of helplessness when little You Yueqing held her arm. Just looking at Sun Rong's inner thoughts were only of Wang Ling at that time.</p>

    <p>She can only say that little Wang Ling is so easy to understand. Even if there is no expression on his face, what bad intentions can a child have... His thoughts are often directly reflected on his face.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing skillfully switched while playing the video. This display is not for showing off, but simply for sharing.</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Rong's transfixed look, she immediately said, "Would you like me to make a copy for you later? You can use the AI to change my face. Just change my appearance to the one you had when you were a child."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is this okay?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked surprised. At the same time, she didn't expect You Yueqing to say that.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong? It's all in the past anyway. Now we are competing fairly." You Yueqing smiled generously. At the same time, it was also very meaningful: "By the way. I remember taking pictures of Wang Ling almost destroying the earth!"</p>

    <p>"Destroy... the Earth?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. He almost fell down when he was a child. Fortunately, my uncle and aunt reacted quickly and pulled him up immediately."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I'll look for this video. I remember it's in my camera."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing frowned slightly and began to search for related videos. She fiddled with the switching button. Suddenly, the video was switched to the scenes taken when she just entered Li Xuan's apartment.</p>

    <p>"Wait!" At this time, Sun Rong suddenly reached out and pressed the pause button.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is there something wrong?"</p>

    <p>"Look. There seems to be writing on that white wall." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Really?" You Yueqing frowned. She stared at the camera and observed it repeatedly for a long time. Sure enough, she vaguely discovered that on the white wall captured by the camera, there were several characters that were faintly glowing with white light.</p>

    <p>However, these characters are not very obvious because they are the same color as the wall. They are also very dim. If you don't look carefully, you can't see them at all.</p>

    <p>"What is this?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said in confusion: "The things that Wang Ling hid from us before are these characters, right? He thinks these characters may be dangerous."</p>

    <p>"That should be right."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing nodded and said, "But I feel that these characters look familiar. It seems like I have seen them somewhere."</p>

    <p>"You have seen it?" Sun Rong was even more confused.</p>

    <p>"I remember that the owner of the shop once wrote similar characters. But I'm not sure if they are the same type." You Yueqing said.</p>

    <p>This is a new clue.</p>

    <p>Originally Sun Rong and You Yueqing had decided not to get involved in this matter. However, this accidental discovery suddenly aroused a strong desire for investigation in the two of them.</p>

    <p>What's more, what Sun Rong didn't expect is that the mysterious characters on the white wall are actually related to the owner of Fenglei Village. In other words, this old owner may actually be related to the video blogger Li, the person involved in the accident who suddenly disappeared from the world?</p>

    <p>This accidental discovery made both Sun Rong and You Yueqing feel the complexity behind the incident. It was as if a pair of invisible hands were promoting the development of the entire incident.</p>

    <p>"We have to go to the village owner and ask." You Yueqing made a decision immediately.</p>

    <p>"This is not stable." Sun Rong said: "We still have to be conservative. It's too unstable for just the two of us. Let's do this. I know a few seniors. If we call them together, then they can keep us safe."</p>

    <p>"Senior?" You Yueqing looked suspicious.</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong immediately took out her mobile phone and sent private message notifications to several people in the core management group of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Monk Jin Deng, Li Xian, Zhang Zhui, Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi, Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi...</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, Sun Rong was fully informed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling is still experiencing the eternal past events in the {Diary of Emperor Dongda}.</p>

    <p>The actions and conversations of the body are all carried out automatically. Although he is already in the body and can control the body, he does not act rashly.</p>

    <p>If the events recorded in the diary are true, it means that the diary itself represents a real event from the past. Wang Ling feels that if he has any abnormal behavior or behavior that violates the normal behavior in the diary it may change history.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of the white-robed manager Ye Ren, Wang Ling finally saw the envoy sent by the Western Emperor in the main hall of the Eastern Emperor's Palace. The envoy was wearing a pitch-black hooded robe, and a long white beard hanging down to the ground like a waterfall, reaching to the toes.</p>

    <p>Even when facing Emperor Dongda, the envoy still showed no fear. He did not take the imperial majesty of Emperor Dongda into consideration at all.</p>

    <p>In such an environment, he stretched out his hand from the black robe and showed a silver dagger. There were traces of the nine-headed devil snake on it. It was the symbol of the Western Emperor. It symbolized that he was the Daixi Emperor.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it. This is an extremely disrespectful and provocative move.</p>

    <p>Ye Reng was about to have a seizure, but was suddenly stopped in place by Dongda's wink.</p>

    <p>But such an arrogant messenger was obviously something that even Emperor Dongda had never seen before.</p>

    <p>Then he still sat on the golden and spacious Suzaku King Chair in his imperial posture, accepting the worship of the envoy from the Western Emperor.</p>

    <p>"Foreign envoy Yan Sanyang visited Emperor Dongda. May Emperor Dongda be blessed with great blessings."</p>

    <p>The sound was not too loud. It echoed in the empty palace. Except for the white-robed steward Ye Ren and several old ministers, the imperial palace, which originally had more than a hundred ministers, seemed extremely empty under the echo of this cry.</p>

    <p>Based on the current plot sequence, Wang Ling can roughly judge. There was a coup in the Eastern Palace not long ago.</p>

    <p>Most of the officials in the Eastern Emperor's camp have defected. Now only these few in the main hall are left to negotiate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is hidden in the body of the Eastern Emperor. Patiently waiting for the next development of the plot.</p>

    <p>Then he heard what Yan Sanyang, the envoy from the Western Emperor, said.</p>

    <p>Yan Sanyang: "In addition to paying compensation and dividing the Star Territory, my Western Lord has additional requirements. If the Eastern Emperor agrees, we will release all prisoners of war and evacuate the Star Territory immediately."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Emperor Dongda was silent for a moment. Then he spoke. His voice was deep and majestic: "Let's talk and listen."</p>

    <p>"I heard that the Eastern Emperor discovered an abandoned palace of the Outer Gods on Youran Planet. It is said that there are heart fragments of a top Outer God inside." Yan Sanyang said: "I, the Western Emperor, requested that the Eastern Emperor will be here in this palace. Things found in the palace of the Outer Gods. Hand them over..."</p>

    <p>These words immediately attracted the attention of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The heart fragment of the top outer god?</p>

    <p>Is it the mysterious thing that was later called "Destiny?"</p>

    <p>What was it that Dao Ancestor Wang tried his best to seal after he discovered it?</p>
