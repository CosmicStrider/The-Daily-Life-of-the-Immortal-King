  <h1>Chapter 1252 Affordable Principal</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even though Tuoyi Delei looks down on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But in fact, judging from the frown on his face, he didn't take this battle lightly at all.</p>

    <p>Apollo Lidman, the messenger of the sun, died at the hands of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>In the same situation where there is a huge gap in realms, how did Zhuo Yi defeat the messenger of the sun? This can't help but make Chariot think deeply.</p>

    <p>As a Sword master, Chariot pulled out his silver knight sword from his waist at this moment.</p>

    <p>The full name of his sword is "Silver God of War." The abbreviation is: Silver God.</p>

    <p>Chariot's expression is calm. After having the experience of fighting against the ethereal spirit, Zhuo Yi can now tell whether a person is infected by the ethereal spirit from his breath.</p>

    <p>Of course, this method of identification may not be completely accurate.</p>

    <p>However, the breath of the chariot was stable. Its breath contained a strong aura of heaven and earth.</p>

    <p>There is a clear difference from Snake who is not a human being.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the probability of the chariot being invaded by ethereal spirits is extremely small. However, Zhuo Yi feels a little uneasy.</p>

    <p>He stared at the thick silver sword in his chariot hand. He frowned slightly. He instinctively felt that something was wrong in it.</p>

    <p>"Your sword..." Zhuo Yi only felt that something was wrong with this silver sword. But he couldn't tell what was wrong.</p>

    <p>"Everyone can tell lies. You will definitely die today. The messenger of the star position is a calculation. In this battle, I have a 95% winning rate!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Chariot was holding a silver sword. He raised the sword high and slashed towards the teaching building.</p>

    <p>The silver sword energy tens of meters high seemed to be slashed out, making a sound of the sky falling apart and the earth cracking. The ground was split into two!</p>

    <p>The entire teaching building was cut in half in an instant. Then it collapsed. The gravel and rubble exploded out.</p>

    <p>Chariot only used a sword. A teaching building of Number 60 High School had been razed to the ground and reduced to ruins.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stood on the ruins and looked around.</p>

    <p>Only then did he realize that it seemed to be more than just the principal's office.</p>

    <p>All classroom tables, chairs, equipment, and teaching instruments have been emptied and removed...</p>

    <p>It seems that Principal Chen has long expected that there will be a battle today.</p>

    <p>So he thought that he could use this battle to demolish Number 60 High School for free.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi was amazed at Principal Chen's calculations.</p>

    <p>It's really scary to have such an affordable man as a principal...</p>

    <p>But in fact, he and Principal Chen had a tacit understanding. The reason why he chose Number 60 High School was for this purpose.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is about to be renovated. If the old doesn't go, the new won't come.</p>

    <p>It will cost extra to hire someone to demolish it. It is not as economical as this.</p>

    <p>After a sword strike, Chariot stared at Zhuo Yi standing on the ruins. The sword he just struck was extremely powerful. Not to mention destroying a teaching building, it could even destroy this area and the land within dozens of miles. All divided into two.</p>

    <p>But what surprised Chariot was that when his sword energy passed through the teaching building and spread backwards, it was blocked by a barrier!</p>

    <p>Then, his extremely powerful sword energy was like a mud cow entering the sea. It was directly transformed into this barrier.</p>

    <p>What the hell is that...</p>

    <p>The chariot messenger felt a little frightened at this time.</p>

    <p>After seeing the astonishing destructive power of the silver sword, Zhuo Yi was also glad that his previous strategy of letting Senior Bai Qiao transform into a "scabbard cage" to surround Number 60 High School was correct.</p>

    <p>This cage can be entered but cannot be exited. It can also block all energy, preventing their fight from spreading to other places.</p>

    <p>"As expected of a foundation under the Alliance. Any messenger has True Immortal-level combat power."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi just smiled calmly at this time: "To be fair, I think SBP is a very promising organization. You once established this foundation with the purpose of exposing the truth. But now it has deviated from the original intention and has become a burying ground." An organization of the truth. If everyone in your organization was like Mr. Keorn and had a sincere heart to pursue the truth, there would not be so many broken things now."</p>

    <p>Chariot was stunned when he heard this and remained silent.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said something that he really couldn't refute.</p>

    <p>However, in this world, people die for wealth and birds die for food. Who can be alone? "Now the world is suffering from the disaster of void invasion. The foundation that originally exposed the truth chose to pretend to be deaf and dumb. Let me ask Mr. Chariot. You Don't you know at all? The so-called True Immortal is just a code name for a realm. You call yourself immortal, but you may not have the character of an immortal."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's words finally made Chariot's expression change drastically.</p>

    <p>A few words. This has already hurt Chariot: "You said I'm not immortal? I actually said I'm not immortal..."</p>

    <p>He was almost shaking with anger. It felt like he had experienced some great humiliation. The angry eyes passed through the silver helmet and hit Zhuo Yi's face directly. It made Zhuo Yi feel a little bit embarrassed on his face. Itchy.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi. You will definitely die today."</p>

    <p>The next moment, Tuoyi Delei took a deep breath. He danced with the silver sword. Then he thrust the sword into the ground!</p>

    <p>Huge spiritual energy fluctuations came immediately. Then they gradually condensed into substance in the void. They were a group of snow-white unicorns. Their whole bodies were airtightly wrapped in silver armor!</p>

    <p>"Is this the sword spirit of the Yin Shen Great Sword?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's pupils shrank slightly.</p>

    <p>The size of this sword spirit is extraordinary. At least according to Zhuo Yi's knowledge, the size of this sword spirit has exceeded the standard! From a distance, it looks like a monster that landed on the earth from an alien planet!</p>

    <p>The human body is as small as an ant in front of this sword spirit!</p>

    <p>There's something wrong with this sword spirit...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned deeply as he looked at Xue Qilin, which was dozens of feet tall.</p>

    <p>He even felt the pressure coming from the sword spirit. It was already greater than Tuoyi Delei himself!</p>

    <p>And soon. Zhuo Yi figured out what happened: "You let your sword spirit accept the void?"</p>

    <p>There was no mistake. He could feel the same feeling of being invaded by ethereal spirits from this Xue Qilin as Snake.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Xue Qilin was summoned as a sword spirit. It was more like wailing than roaring.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi doesn't know what means the foundation used to actually control the fusion of the ethereal spirit and the sword spirit. But he can hear that Xue Qilin, as the sword spirit, instinctively resists the ethereal spirit!</p>

    <p>The invasion of ethereal spirits is devouring Xue Qilin's will, making it feel pain!</p>

    <p>"Have you finally discovered it. Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Tuoyi Delei laughed wildly: "Originally, I didn't plan to use this trump card. Because the fusion of my great sword, Sword Spirit, and Void Spirit is not perfect. It is easy to go berserk. But now I have figured it out. This is not my land. Why do I need to be so polite?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Zhuo Yi looked expressionless.</p>

    <p>Everything is as he thought. Not only does the Foundation have a lot of information about ethereal spirits, but it seems from now on that they even have secret experiments on ethereal spirits...</p>

    <p>They actually used the virtual spirit to combine the virtual spirit with the weapon spirit. This multiplied the power of the magic weapon thousands of times!</p>

    <p>Feeling the sword spirit monster created by his own hands. Tuoyi Delei stared at Zhuo Yi. He smiled solemnly: "To tell you the truth. When I saw my sword spirit grow because of the power of the virtual spirit. Even I am a little moved! Do you know why I investigated the news about Yi Zhiyang? He is my flesh and blood. I want to see what the bastard born of a bitch... can change after being invaded by the virtual spirit. How strong!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Zhuo Yi spat on the spot!</p>

    <p>This scumbag!</p>
