  <h1>Chapter 2029 On how double standards the CP leader has</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Apparently Boss Sun came all the way here because he was worried about Sun Rong's comfort. He even took the unknown and mysterious risk of the seabed and dived all the way to search for Sun Rong's spiritual power. Here, the spirit of protecting the calf is really touching.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Yiyuan was full of doubts. Because he knew that Sun Rong took leave from Number 60 High School today. He said that he was going to the Office of Strategic Deception for special training. But why did he suddenly use a submarine to find other Sun family ancestors? The earth has come?</p>

    <p>Is this also part of the special training?</p>

    <p>But after entering the submarine, when the old man saw the scene in front of him, he began to think in his mind: "Why is the cave immortal here? Could it be that he brought his classmate Wang Ling and my Rongrong to the deep sea for special training?"</p>

    <p>I saw Immortal Toya bowing to Sun Yiyuan respectfully and saying, "Don't be surprised, Mr. Boss Sun. This is indeed a special training session arranged by me. It's just because he mentioned the words "Master and Laojun" too much during the Office of Strategic Deception. The story between the ancestors of the Sun family aroused the curiosity of the two children."</p>

    <p>"Oh, so that's it." Sun Yiyuan nodded. He just said that he didn't have to do special training in the Office of Strategic Deception. Why did he suddenly come to the bottom of the sea to find the Sun family's ancestral land?</p>

    <p>But now after hearing Immortal Toya's explanation, Sun Yiyuan felt that the reason given by Immortal Toya was quite reasonable.</p>

    <p>After all, he is the descendant of Laojun. He has an unusual relationship with the Sun family. There is an ancestor worship event held every five hundred years. As the descendant of Laojun, Immortal Toya has a fixed seat.</p>

    <p>This point alone cannot be matched by others.</p>

    <p>Today, Immortal Toya has multiple identities. In addition to being the island owner of Chrysanthemum Island, he is also the leader of the elixir team of the Office of Strategic Deception and the special alchemy consultant of his Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>He is highly praised in the alchemy industry. He enjoys special subsidies from the Huaxiu National Academy of Alchemy Research.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, I'm sorry. It's all me... I was too willful." Sun Rong apologized quickly. She actually didn't expect Boss Sun to come directly to this place.</p>

    <p>After all, the old man has no idea of her current true strength. The bottom of the earth is filled with many mysterious and unknown risks. It is reasonable for the old man to be worried.</p>

    <p>"Hey, it's actually a good thing for young people to be curious. But you also have to pay attention to safety, you know? The ancestral land. In fact, it's not that entry is not allowed. But it must comply with the procedures and rules." Sun Yiyuan said with a smile. He was as kind as ever.</p>

    <p>"Eh? It turns out that someone who is not from the Sun family is still qualified to enter?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"It all depends on the relationship. If you are a good friend and have a certificate, of course you can enter."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan said: "Look, doesn't Immortal Dong have a pendant handed down from Lao Jun that symbolizes friendship?"</p>

    <p>"Eh? What about classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"You've already said it. Classmate Wang Ling is your classmate. Aren't you yourself a witness?"</p>

    <p>"Is this okay..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Rong felt that this explanation seemed a bit forced. Then he asked: "So... what about Mr. Zanghu? Grandpa should also know him. He is a famous popular science scholar in the cultivation circle."</p>

    <p>"Well, of course I know him, but he can't come in." Sun Yiyuan nodded.</p>

    <p>"..." Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>The name of Mr. Zanghu is naturally well-known in the cultivation circle. Sun Yiyuan has heard about it.</p>

    <p>He had also seen the video on the popular online spirit beast identification series. But he didn't expect that Mr. Zhenren, the Tibetan Fox, was actually a Tibetan fox.</p>

    <p>Apparently, he became like this because he became possessed after practicing cultivation.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Boss Sun... I was rescued by the Sun Rong girl on this trip. I accidentally boarded this submarine. Regarding your Sun family's ancestral land, I was not interested at first. I am really interested. Only the ancient whale."</p>

    <p>"Sorry. Then you can't come in either." Sun Yiyuan said sternly.</p>

    <p>"Why. Girl Sun Rong is also a fan of mine..."</p>

    <p>"It has nothing to do with whether you are right or not. Because you are still an outsider after all."</p>

    <p>"That classmate Wang Ling is also..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I have known him for a long time. And there is a destiny connection between him and Rongrong. Therefore, I consider him a friend of the Sun family."..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Fate connection?" Immortal Toya was also curious: "Dare to ask Mr. Boss Sun. Where does this fate connection come from?"</p>

    <p>"Look. The total number of strokes in classmate Wang Ling's name is nine. And the total number of strokes in Rongrong's name is nineteen. All of them contain the character nine!"</p>

    <p>"so it is..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded: "What Mr. Boss Sun means is that there is a kind of destiny in this?"</p>

    <p>The more Sun Yiyuan spoke, the more unable to conceal the smile on his lips: "It's not that profound. It just means long-lasting..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya can see it. This is the aunt's smile when the CP leader is knocking CP...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face turned red after being said. He quickly covered Sun Yiyuan's mouth: "Grandpa...please. Stop talking..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He just told the truth. Unexpectedly, Sun Rong blushed.</p>

    <p>After all, he is still a young man. He is thin-skinned.</p>

    <p>It's not like when he chased Grandma Sun when he was young. He was completely risk-free. Later, he even used a shameless method to trick Grandma Sun.</p>

    <p>But those old things, in Sun Yiyuan's opinion, it's okay not to mention them.</p>

    <p>He stared at Mr. Hidden Fox in front of him. He frowned and said, "Well, Dr. Xiao, the ancestral land of the Sun family is indeed an important place in our clan. It is true that no outsider has ever entered. But after all, you are a popular science scholar studying the world of cultivation. I You are allowed to enter the belly of the senior ancient whale. But you can only stay in the area I designated. Don't move around at will, you know?"</p>

    <p>"The ancestral land of my Sun family is among the 100,000 mountains in the belly of the ancient whale. It is very complicated. If you walk around without anyone to guide you, there will be risks."</p>

    <p>"..." This blunt statement also made Mr. Zanghu panic.</p>

    <p>Because now. He seems to have heard a terrible secret...</p>

    <p>It turns out that the ancestral land of the Sun family is hidden in the belly of the ancient whale. And that ancient whale does indeed exist! What he saw before was not an illusion!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Boss Sun is so supportive of my research work. I really don't know what to say..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan smiled and waved his hand quickly: "In fact, it doesn't matter. Because there is a restriction on the ancestral land. When Mr. Hidden Fox comes out of the belly of Senior Ancient Whale, he will forget everything that happened inside."</p>

    <p>"..." Mr. Zanghu: "Let's put it this way. Dong Immortal and classmate Wang Ling will also..."</p>

    <p>"Oh. They won't. They are not outsiders. But you are."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
