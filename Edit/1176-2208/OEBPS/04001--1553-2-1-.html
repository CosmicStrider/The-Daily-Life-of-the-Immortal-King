  <h1>Chapter 1553 The Cold War between Wang Ming and Zhai Yin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After listening to Zhang Zhui's introduction to the others, Wang Ling and Wang Ying were able to analyze some of Dao Ancestor Wang's temper and character.</p>

    <p>In terms of feeling, they were all surprised to find that Dao Ancestor Wang was actually a very narrow-minded person...</p>

    <p>The majestic founder of the world of cultivation, is he so intolerant of a grain of sand in his eyes?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has some doubts about this.</p>

    <p>He heard all kinds of weird reasons for being "suppressed." He felt that maybe he couldn't just listen to these people's words.</p>

    <p>These people were once all-powerful and powerful men of eternity.</p>

    <p>I have been suppressed in this Corpse Map for so long. Mental health cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>It is inevitable that mental distortion will occur and distort the facts...</p>

    <p>Based on Wang Ling's experience.</p>

    <p>As long as people from both parties are involved in anything, you must not just listen to one side.</p>

    <p>If you easily believe one party and are eager to take sides, then in the end, once things turn around, you will be the only one who is embarrassed.</p>

    <p>This kind of thing has never happened in ancient times. Even in the current Internet age, Wang Ling has seen too many things.</p>

    <p>There are indeed many people who exaggerate about something in order to attract others' attention...</p>

    <p>A while ago, Wang Ling also saw a matriarch who splashed red ink on her daughter's school uniform because she had a disagreement with a teacher. She said the teacher abused her daughter at school.</p>

    <p>Why is the most basic trust between people now gone?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the reason should be found in these people.</p>

    <p>All those who consume kindness should reflect on themselves.</p>

    <p>Here. Wang Ling is thinking thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui in the picture scroll suddenly laughed: "Dao Ancestor Wang's behavior is unpredictable. Those of us who were suppressed here sometimes doubt whether what we see is really Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>"I know. You must think that Dao Ancestor Wang is the founder of Taoism. You should be more cautious than that. But sometimes. Facts speak louder than words. If you don't believe me. I have no other way."</p>

    <p>At this point, Zhang Zhui seemed to have remembered something. He then said: "By the way. You can ask Old God for confirmation on this matter."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui looked at Wang Ying, and his expression looked a little strange. He seemed to understand something instantly.</p>

    <p>In an instant, even his voice became much lower: "Did she... fall?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Wang Ying felt a little embarrassed when talking about this matter.</p>

    <p>After all, the fall of the Old God is related to them.</p>

    <p>I was hacked to death by Sun Rong not long ago...</p>

    <p>The grass on this grave may be several feet high.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. When Wang Ling restored Zhang Zhui's original appearance through King's Eyes, I saw a deep sense of melancholy appear on his face after he mentioned Old God.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying also saw this scene clearly.</p>

    <p>Although he does not have the ability of King's Eyes, as long as Wang Ling turns on vision sharing, he can see the scene in front of him clearly as the shadow of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although I'm not sure.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ying had an intuition. He felt that the relationship between Zhang Zhui and Old God might be more complicated than imagined.</p>

    <p>Although only listening to Zhang Zhui's words makes people think that the relationship between them may just be a one-time date.</p>

    <p>But the expression on his face cannot be deceiving.</p>

    <p>Skeletons cannot see expressions. And Zhang Zhui, like most people here, forgot how to manage his expressions after becoming a skeleton.</p>

    <p>So now. This scene was captured by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In short.</p>

    <p>This Zhang Zhui is a person with a story.</p>

    <p>There were so many powerful Eternal level warriors suppressed in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's own temper, he is too lazy to continue looking for other candidates.</p>

    <p>He and Wang Ying had the same idea.</p>

    <p>I have decided to dig out some information from Zhang Zhui in front of me.</p>

    <p>"We want to know something. You just need to answer the information you know. My master can rescue you. What do you think of this deal?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>He thought Zhang Zhui would happily agree.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the other party just shook his head: "An eternal thief like me cannot see the light. I can't get out. It doesn't mean much to me."</p>

    <p>"Then what do you want?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"My request is actually very simple. If you want to get information from me, then search for it for me. The descendants of my lineage will do well."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "I have been suppressed here for too long. But I still clearly remember that I have three sons. If they can successfully continue my lineage... there should still be descendants of mine in this world. people."</p>

    <p>"Are you so sure they're still alive?"</p>

    <p>"Honestly, I'm not sure." Zhang Zhui smiled and said, "After all, it's been too long."</p>

    <p>Find your own future.</p>

    <p>This is Zhang Zhui's only wish now.</p>

    <p>"Haha. I just wanted to satisfy my curiosity."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "If my lineage can continue smoothly, the descendants who are still alive in the world, I assert that their cultivation level may not be too high."</p>

    <p>"You are an eternally powerful person." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"So what about the Eternal-level powerhouse. I was suppressed in the Corpse Map. I have ruined the opportunity to pass on the orthodoxy to future generations. Even if they can continue my bloodline, without the inheritance of the original orthodoxy, this generation will continue. Only one generation after another. It will only become weaker and weaker."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "Since your master has the ability to take me out of this Corpse Map, then it must not be difficult to find my descendants."</p>

    <p>"It's natural."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>At this point, the negotiations between the two parties have ended successfully.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling received a new task: to find the descendants of Zhang Zhui as a condition for exchanging information.</p>

    <p>This matter is indeed not difficult for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As long as he uses his pupil power to trace his bloodline later.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui knows. His answer is actually a bit rude.</p>

    <p>Because he himself doesn't know whether people of his own lineage can pass on...</p>

    <p>In case of death, he actually has nothing to say.</p>

    <p>With a little curiosity, Zhang Zhui looked at Wang Ying and Wang Ling and said, "If I have no descendants, then this transaction will be considered a failure."</p>

    <p>Eternal things, many secrets. Although Zhang Zhui knows a lot, he actually doesn't want to say it.</p>

    <p>The so-called Heavenly Dao's law, equivalent exchange.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also understands this truth.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui felt that there was little hope for this matter. It was just a request he made casually.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, Wang Ying looked at him swornly: "Don't worry, my master will definitely find it. Even if he doesn't, he can still help you get it. Even if he digs out his grave and reincarnates, he will find one for you."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Many question marks suddenly appeared in Zhang Zhui's mind.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had noticed something strange about the young man in front of him a long time ago...</p>

    <p>He opened the Corpse Map with his bare hands. With his own strength, he suppressed this group of eternal level experts and lost their temper.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the other party can actually violate the Heavenly Dao rules arranged by Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>What kind of person is this young man?</p>

    <p>At this moment. Zhang Zhui was looking at Wang Ling's red eyes. He was thinking about it in his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The time came to Friday, December 18th. It was approaching noon.</p>

    <p>The "upper-class student exchange meeting" Jisaki mentioned earlier is about to begin.</p>

    <p>There is a small built-in forest in the trench of Jiudaohe High School. This time, the S District exchange meeting was held in this forest hut.</p>

    <p>"It's just ahead."</p>

    <p>Following Jisaki along the long cobblestone road, the group from Number 60 High School finally saw the slightly fantasy cabin in the forest. The entire house was built directly on the big tree.</p>

    <p>This tree is a thousand-year-old tree. Its base is so large that more than fifty people cannot wrap around it.</p>

    <p>The branches above are densely intertwined, and the midday sun penetrates through the gaps in the leaves, leaving broken light that moves with the wind on the ground.</p>

    <p>According to Jisaki, this cabin in the forest was originally used as a place for special training.</p>

    <p>Use requires approval from the Academic Affairs Office.</p>

    <p>The Rainbow Seven Gang chose this location this time. It can be regarded as giving full play to the capitalist advantages of the students in District S...</p>

    <p>This was originally a very quiet place.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not very repulsive to the surrounding environment. On the contrary, he likes it a little bit.</p>

    <p>But as soon as there are more people, his mood becomes less beautiful.</p>

    <p>"Can we really do this?" Zhai Yin held her forehead. She was wearing a dress from Sun Rong. Her face was red with embarrassment.</p>

    <p>Because of her career, she has not worn skirts or other clothing in front of outsiders for a long time...</p>

    <p>Most of my usual outfits when going out are neutral. Occasionally, I wear a skirt when meeting acquaintances.</p>

    <p>But now. Because Sun Rong is pretending to be Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>She had to pretend to be Sun Rong. to fill the vacant position of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School cohort. Everyone's attention will still be on the three students who are exchange students this time.</p>

    <p>As for Zhai Yin, who appears as an assistant teacher, he will not attract too many people's attention.</p>

    <p>"I think this is good. You always wear it like that. It's good to change your clothes occasionally." Wang Ming grinned and encouraged from the side.</p>

    <p>"But..." Zhai Yin was still hesitating.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, she is shy. On the other hand, she feels that the current circuit diagram is starting to become a little confusing.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing to be afraid of. When others come to talk to you, just say no politely with a smile." Wang Ming said, sounding very skilled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong heard this. They began to feel that something was wrong in the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>"If another boy comes to see me, are you sure you won't be angry?" Zhai Yin asked again before entering the room.</p>

    <p>It was only later that Wang Ling and Wang Ming realized that this was actually a proposition...</p>

    <p>But this is where Wang Ming's temperament lies. Because he is used to straight men, he doesn't think too much about it.</p>

    <p>Faced with Zhai Yin's question, he didn't even think of using {mental deduction} to confirm the answer.</p>

    <p>Because he felt that it was just a trivial matter. The two of them should not have a dispute over such a thing.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming replied without thinking: "Why should I be angry? It's just acting."</p>

    <p>"It's acting. But you know clearly... I'm not actually Rongrong!" Zhai Yin said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "?"</p>

    <p>It's not easy to understand a girl's mind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't believe this sentence before falling in love.</p>

    <p>Now. He believes it...</p>

    <p>When he began to realize how strange Zhai Yin's problem was.</p>

    <p>Then use the {brain deduction technique}. The result is already too late.</p>

    <p>Because there are only two roads before us.</p>

    <p>And no matter which way he goes, it will be his fault in the end...</p>

    <p>If you are angry, then you are playing into Zhai Yin's heart.</p>

    <p>This guy just wants to see him jealous.</p>

    <p>However. In the end, it will be labeled as "small-minded."</p>

    <p>If you don't get angry...</p>

    <p>The consequences seem to be more serious.</p>

    <p>He will be labeled as someone who "doesn't care about his girlfriend" again.</p>

    <p>Love is a science.</p>

    <p>Sometimes seemingly simple problems are actually much more complicated than scientific principles.</p>

    <p>So now Wang Ming only feels full of regret.</p>

    <p>I regret that I didn't spend time alone with Zhai Yin in the Jiudaohe dormitory two days ago. I directly helped Zhai Yin get settled...</p>

    <p>The little girl watches too many TV series. She likes to have random thoughts when she has nothing to do.</p>

    <p>The scene fell into an inexplicable silence.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming has the answer in his mind.</p>

    <p>But these two answers will be "labeled" in the end. And neither of them is what Wang Ming wants to see.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming, who really didn't know how to deal with this matter, fell into silence.</p>

    <p>This directly caused the scene to fall into a more powerful low pressure.</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang. Were they like this before?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki asked in a low voice to Sun Rong who was disguised as Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>"I don't know either..." Sun Rong didn't know how to answer Jisaki's words.</p>

    <p>The main girl also encountered a cold war between lovers for the first time. In addition, she didn't have much experience in love herself... she didn't know how to deal with this at all.</p>

    <p>Seeing that we are approaching the cabin. Sun Rong is trying to change the subject. Change the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Then Jisaki suddenly said, "Hey. The married couple quarrel is over. I think the two of you just need to get over it. We have a big enemy in front of us. We can't fight each other, right?"</p>

    <p>"Who's married to him/her?"</p>

    <p>As soon as Jisaki finished speaking, Wang Ming and Zhai Yin crossed their arms in unison and turned their faces to the left and right.</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's view, Zhai Yin was deliberately looking for a fight.</p>

    <p>It's just acting, isn't it? Why do you have to think about so many unnecessary things?</p>

    <p>He felt.</p>

    <p>Ultimately this is still a question of trust.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin doesn't believe in herself.</p>

    <p>This is what annoys him the most.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhai Yin was also troubled by Wang Ming's silent behavior.</p>

    <p>She actually knew that she was looking for trouble... but couldn't this guy give her a step down!</p>

    <p>What does this silence mean?</p>

    <p>Isn't that just... I don't care about her...</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>The two of them are worrying about their own things.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong did not expect that the situation would develop to this point...</p>

    <p>They thought that the situation could not be worse than now.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming's next words directly detonated Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>Before entering the wooden house, Wang Ming became more and more angry as he thought about it. So he said casually: "If you think that way, there is nothing I can do about it."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhai Yin's face turned ugly for a moment.</p>

    <p>Sun RongAs soon as he heard this, he knew something was wrong!</p>

    <p>"If you think that way, I can't help it!" This sentence is one of the top ten famous sentences that girls hate most when boys say it!</p>

    <p>According to the latest ranking statistics!</p>

    <p>This sentence ranked third in overall votes!</p>
