  <h1>Chapter 1780 I crossed the mountains and the sea. Just for...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Helped Li Weiwei to get out of the siege smoothly. Sun Rong quickly returned to the immortal boat. Butler Lin was completely dumbfounded...</p>

    <p>Although he did not see the specific process of the battle clearly. He only roughly knew that Sun Rong and Master Haiyao Jushi seemed to have been sucked into a different space to fight at the beginning of the battle.</p>

    <p>Then within a few minutes, Sun Rong and Master Haiyao Jushi reappeared.</p>

    <p>And then. There will be no more...</p>

    <p>Butler Lin saw Sun Rong dive into the sea and start chasing and beating Haiyao Jushi.</p>

    <p>What did he just see?</p>

    <p>A cultivator in the Foundation Building stage is chasing a master with extraordinary combat power and unknown realm...</p>

    <p>And directly forced him to commit suicide...</p>

    <p>Even if it's an over-level counter-attack, you still have to follow the basic law!</p>

    <p>"Miss... you..."</p>

    <p>"Haha. I hope Uncle Lin will keep it a secret for me today." Sun Rong stuck out her tongue and tried to pass the test in a cute way: "It's not that I am strong. My master's spiritual sword is very powerful. Basically, if you hold the spirit sword , I was possessed by my master's divine power. Basically, the subsequent battles were actually controlled by my master's spiritual sword."</p>

    <p>"So that's it!" Butler Lin nodded. He firmly believed in Sun Rong's words.</p>

    <p>He grew up watching Sun Rong. He knows that lying is not Sun Rong's character. And indeed, this is the only explanation that can reasonably explain why a Foundation Building period can chase after a master who exceed her own level.</p>

    <p>As for the possession by the sword spirit mentioned by Sun Rong, although Butler Lin has never experienced it, it is not difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this is the legendary "substitute attack!"</p>

    <p>"My Sun family is really lucky that Miss can have such a strong person as her teacher this time!" Butler Lin bowed and said respectfully: "It's just Miss. I have one last question..."</p>

    <p>"Yes Uncle Lin."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't the lady tell the master about this?"</p>

    <p>"Because... Master, she has always been used to keeping a low profile..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong tried her best to say with a smile: "This time she accepts me as a disciple. It is also a closed disciple. She doesn't plan to announce it to the outside world."</p>

    <p>"Moreover, my master is afraid of being courteous to others, so if Grandpa finds out about this and arranges for someone to deliver a bunch of gifts, I'm afraid it will cause trouble for my master. Not to mention the fact that my master is a woman who treats worldly things like floating clouds, and money like dirt..."</p>

    <p>"Oh. Got it."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin also laughed: "As expected of you, Miss. The people you like are low-key people."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong immediately turned her head to the window: "I went to Glio City this time... to see Muyu. Not for him..."</p>

    <p>In response to this obvious quibble, Butler Lin still smiled and said nothing: "I discovered a problem."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"I found that good friends can also infect each other. Ever since the young lady became friends with Miss Jiugong Liangzi of the Jiugong family, I felt that what the young lady said was somewhat duplicitous."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong found that there was nothing left to talk about today. It was only because Lao Lin knew her so well.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter. Now as long as Lao Lin doesn't tell Wang Piaoliang's story, it will be fine.</p>

    <p>She wasn't sure how long she could hide it.</p>

    <p>She even thought about whether to directly erase Lao Lin's memory.</p>

    <p>However, after careful consideration, she felt that it would be better to have a trustworthy semi-informed person in the Sun family.</p>

    <p>And Butler Lin is actually a very good candidate.</p>

    <p>The immortal boat passed through layers of clouds and mist in the sky. Just before it arrived at Glio City, Sun Rong heard Lao Lin suddenly say something to her. He said as if he was deliberately giving her a reassurance. : "Thank you, Miss, for telling me these things. Please rest assured, Miss. I will definitely not tell anything about Miss Wang."</p>

    <p>"Young lady is willing to tell me. You must really trust me. But I also need to remind you that not everyone in our group is trustworthy..."</p>

    <p>"I see."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded and said, "Uncle Lin, don't be too pretentious. It's no different from directly naming someone... You are referring to Jiang Xiaoche."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin nodded and spoke bluntly: "This time, the matter about Master Muyu was leaked. The master has already found out. He cannot be separated from it. But... he was thinking of old friendship, so he didn't punish him directly."</p>

    <p>"Why."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed: "Jiang Xiaoche. In fact, he is just a bit stupid... it is too easy to fall into a trap and be used by others. If you want to say that he is particularly bad, it seems that he is not. He underestimated the danger of the Tengu gang."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin nodded: "This time, the lady's whereabouts were leaked. There were also reports from individual employees within the group. It was he who leaked the information."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "It is not Jiang Xiaoche's character to commit crimes against the wind. But after all, my trip abroad was all planned by him. I was ambushed by the Tengu on the road. It must be inseparable from him."</p>

    <p>"What the lady is saying is that within the group, there are many people who covet his position as secretary-general. According to the original plan, the secretary-general should be accompanying him on this overseas trip."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said: "But in the end, the master still chose me to protect the safety of the young lady. This is actually a hint. I just hope that he will not be so confused in the future."</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin is right."</p>

    <p>This heart-to-heart talk made Sun Rong not think deeply deep in his heart.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Jiang Xiaoche was also her playmate who grew up with her. And in fact, she was not unable to detect Jiang Xiaoche's feelings for her... But sometimes, emotions are a very complicated thing. There is no feeling</p>

    <p>She knew very well that she would never fall in love with Jiang Xiaoche in her life. At most, she would treat him as her brother.</p>

    <p>But in recent days, Jiang Xiaoche has repeatedly acted arrogantly. In the final analysis, she thought it was jealousy that was at work...</p>

    <p>We must find a solution as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Thinking from the perspective of a childhood friend, she really didn't want Jiang Xiaoche to make the same mistake again and again.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin, do you think we should let him find a wife as soon as possible? It would be better to settle down..." Sun Rong said, "You should have a lot of connections in this regard, right?"</p>

    <p>"I can give it a try." Butler Lin nodded.</p>

    <p>Among the spin-off industries of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, such as variety shows in the entertainment industry, it is actually managed by Butler Lin. He has a lot of resources for Zhenren Show under his control.</p>

    <p>The idea put forward by Sun Rong coincides with that of Butler Lin. He really thinks that after returning to Huaxiu, he can find a dating Zhenren show or a love-seeking variety show as soon as possible and arrange it for Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Li Youyue and Fang Xing officially arrived in Glio City. And under the arrangement of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, they stayed in a chain hotel.</p>

    <p>"When will Boss Sun arrive? I have crossed the mountains and the sea. Not just to do my homework here..."</p>

    <p>Next door. When Chen Chao's familiar voice came, Wang Ling immediately trembled.</p>

    <p>What a guy...</p>

    <p>This group of people directly surrounded him.</p>
