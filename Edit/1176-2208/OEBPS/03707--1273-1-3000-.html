  <h1>Chapter 1273 1 eye 3000</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Gold--Deng--Grand--Master--!"</p>

    <p>Seeing the terrifying sight of the monk bleeding from his seven orifices in front of him, Lord Diulei could not help but shout loudly.</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng raised his hand and wiped away the dripping blood on his face: "Donor, don't worry. I'm fine..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was really shocked at this time.</p>

    <p>The spiritual power concentrated in that brick.</p>

    <p>As early as the moment Wang Ling threw it over,</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei can already feel it.</p>

    <p>He has a True Venerated Immortal. I don't dare to pick it up at all.</p>

    <p>Just feeling the mental pressure emanating from the bricks already made him feel extremely uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>And Zen Master Jin Deng not only reached out and took it...</p>

    <p>It lasted about ten seconds before letting go...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei calculated it. These ten seconds. If calculated according to the power of one second = one slap.</p>

    <p>This Zen Master Jin Deng has already received Wang Ling ten times!</p>

    <p>The key is. Ten times!</p>

    <p>Still alive...</p>

    <p>This is what makes Lord Diulei feel most horrified.</p>

    <p>In the opinion of Lord Diulei, such tenacious vitality is unparalleled in ancient and modern times and is unique.</p>

    <p>However, although Zen Master Jin Deng survived, his current condition was obviously not very good.</p>

    <p>His face was pale. He looked like he was about to die at any moment, which made Lord Diulei extremely worried.</p>

    <p>"Master... can you still hold on..."</p>

    <p>"Bad monk... it's okay..." the monk said. He took out a Golden Core from his sleeve and threw it into his mouth.</p>

    <p>This is the nine-turn Golden Core. The elixir was refined by Jin Deng in the 2718th life... Originally, Jin Deng was well prepared in that life and left it to die.</p>

    <p>But starting from the 2718th life, Jin Deng found that he seemed to be invincible.</p>

    <p>In this world, except for Dao Ancestor Wang, it seems that no one else is his opponent.</p>

    <p>And this nine-turn Golden Core used to hang one's life has been continuously inherited until now...</p>

    <p>At this time, Jin Deng threw the nine-turn Jin Deng into his mouth. The internal injuries all over his body began to gradually repair.</p>

    <p>He was indeed right.</p>

    <p>This boy's injuries were not only real injuries, but also had the effect of serious injuries... Fortunately, the nine-turn Golden Core he had prepared could ignore the effects of serious injuries. Otherwise, ordinary healing pills would definitely not be able to cure him. His current injury is good.</p>

    <p>"Real injury + serious injury..." Zen Master Jin Deng was horrified in his heart.</p>

    <p>This person is surprisingly similar to Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>But he was sure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not Dao Ancestor Wang himself.</p>

    <p>So. Who is this young man?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling in the atrium has already walked two-thirds of the way.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was still relaxed.</p>

    <p>These floor tiles by Zen Master Jin Deng did not put any pressure on him.</p>

    <p>He can withstand nearly ten palms of damage without dying.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng is also considered the first person.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling reached out and re-directed the reincarnation memory brick in front of Jin Deng into the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>Since he has already made this memory brick.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't think it should be wasted.</p>

    <p>In the future, it can be used to identify whether the other party is an expert...</p>

    <p>If you are a real master, you should be like Zen Master Jin Deng. You can touch it for several seconds without dying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used his index finger to carve a "10" number mark on the brick. Then he put the memory brick into King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>It represents the current record for how long this memory brick has been held in hand.</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng currently holds the record for ten seconds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to see if anyone can break this record in the future...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that this poor monk, who has been reincarnated for thousands of lives, would hit a wall here..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zen Master Jin Deng stopped knocking on the wooden fish.</p>

    <p>Although the Nine Turns Golden Core stopped his physical injuries, beating the wooden fish is also a spiritual practice in itself.</p>

    <p>His wooden fish is called "Fish of the Sky." It is a magical weapon that is bound to the physical body for practice.</p>

    <p>Every time it is struck, the body will simultaneously bear hundreds of billions of tons of blows.</p>

    <p>Essentially, it is a process of tempering the physical body.</p>

    <p>However, with the current state of his body, he can no longer move...</p>

    <p>If he doesn't take a break and hammer him again, he will die.</p>

    <p>In fact, these inner words of Zen Master Jin Deng saved his life again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling although he has not yet arrived at the Main Hall, he has always been curious about the wooden fish under Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>I wanted to take a look at it by tapping it...</p>

    <p>But since the wooden fish is bound to the physical body of Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is better not to continue to "skin."</p>

    <p>If he accidentally smashes this wooden fish, I'm afraid Master Jin Deng will burst in front of him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>One foot steps into the Mahavira. Compare the pressure inside and outside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels really relaxed.</p>

    <p>But the difference is actually not that big.</p>

    <p>This mental pressure is like the weight of a schoolbag being lifted off.</p>

    <p>"This little donor... who are you..." Zen Master Jin Deng looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The question eventually returned to the topic of "who is the god?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fell silent.</p>

    <p>He himself doesn't even know who he is.</p>

    <p>To this day, he has not found the answer to the question...</p>

    <p>"Poor monk. In all these years, I have never wanted to know the answer so urgently."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zen Master Jin Deng turned his attention to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was already prepared in his heart.</p>

    <p>As long as he knows the answer, even if the outcome of his life is death, he is already satisfied.</p>

    <p>"Master..."</p>

    <p>"I may not die in this life. There is a 50-50 probability."</p>

    <p>"But we came to see the Master because..."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said, "So I have already left the answer. You will only receive this answer after I die."</p>

    <p>"Then my brother's eyes."</p>

    <p>"I don't want my eyes anymore."</p>

    <p>The monk shook his head.</p>

    <p>He has now experienced the power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Already fully understood.</p>

    <p>He couldn't afford this pair of contact lenses.</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng sighed slightly: "So now I have changed my mind. I just ask this donor Wang to stand in front of me and let me take a look."</p>

    <p>"Master, can you see clearly?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. But I want to try." Zen Master Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the monk is a very stubborn person.</p>

    <p>You will never give up until you achieve your goal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat cross-legged on the ground. He shrugged his shoulders with an indifferent expression.</p>

    <p>Even he himself couldn't figure out this secret, let alone the monk in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll start."</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng smiled.</p>

    <p>He nodded towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>The swastika Buddha's light bloomed from his eyes again!</p>

    <p>In an instant!</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng's eyes were bloodshot.</p>

    <p>This glance condensed his reincarnation power for 3,000 lifetimes!</p>

    <p>His sight transcends the eternity of time and has insight into the Milky Way of all universes...</p>

    <p>Then, Zen Master Jin Deng closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>One of his pair of swastikas has been scrapped.</p>

    <p>At the same time, there was a bang in the atrium. An explosion occurred!</p>

    <p>On the ground, 3,000 memory bricks symbolizing the 3,000 reincarnations of Zen Master Jin Deng suddenly collapsed and turned into dust all over the floor...</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng never dreamed of this.</p>

    <p>He spent 3,000 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>In the end, it turned out to be only a chaotic world where light and darkness intertwined.</p>

    <p>I found the outline of a human figure...</p>
