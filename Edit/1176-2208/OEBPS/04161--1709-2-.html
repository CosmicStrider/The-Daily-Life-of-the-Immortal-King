  <h1>Chapter 1709. Two little dragonborn babies. What evil intentions can they have?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the immeasurable Buddha court trembled. The earth shook and the mountains shook. The golden Buddha light shrouding this supreme world was struck by the red dragon's breath. The colorful auspicious clouds on the horizon instantly dispersed.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng was secretly shocked. It was just a dragonborn synthesized by extracting the dragon's genes. The power it possessed was far less than the real power of the dragon in the early days of the eons.</p>

    <p>However, the power it unleashed could reach such an extent. Jin Deng couldn't help but feel a sense of surprise in his heart. This blow of the dragon's claw hit a layer of eggshell-shaped body-protecting Buddha's light firmly.</p>

    <p>This baby-faced fire dragon girl did not penetrate Jin Deng's armor. However, she still left the mark of her own dragon ball on the body-protecting Buddha's light.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The body-protecting Buddha's light followed the paw prints of the dragon's claws and quickly cracked in all directions.</p>

    <p>The dragonborn in front of him is clearly in his supreme world, but he is still immune to the suppression and influence of the power of the world. It is really terrifying to explode with such power.</p>

    <p>No wonder Li Xian was seriously injured.</p>

    <p>And Jin Deng could see that Yan's fighting ability was actually not as good as the man in a khaki trench coat standing behind her and watching from a distance.</p>

    <p>It was this man who injured Li Xian.</p>

    <p>This is the first time that Jin Deng has fought against the Dragon Clan. Although the two Dragonborn in front of him cannot be called true eternal dragons, the significance and value of this battle is undoubtedly huge in the eyes of the monk.</p>

    <p>At least it would give him the experience of fighting dragons in this life.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare to be too big.</p>

    <p>Even in his own supreme world, he would not dare to do this.</p>

    <p>In the early days of the Eternal Dragon Clan, when the Dragon Clan was at its peak, its resounding name has lasted from ancient times to the present. If it had not suffered a disaster due to unknown reasons, those giant dragons in Wanlong Mountain could have killed the leaders of the Outer Gods in the Old Dominator if they had taken action.</p>

    <p>"Then it's time for the poor monk to take action."</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Buddha's light is steaming. It spurts out from every pore on Jin Deng's body. Faintly, the thousand-foot-long golden statue of Sakyamuni behind him is also rising sharply.</p>

    <p>All the scenes in the Wuliang Buddhist Courtyard that were disturbed by the dragon's breath are recovering. They are reappearing to their original grandeur. Sanskrit sounds are lingering from all directions, forming a trap and coming from all directions.</p>

    <p>"So strong...this monk is really difficult to deal with."</p>

    <p>Jingze was extremely frightened. His scalp felt cold as soon as he brushed it. He felt deeply unbelievable.</p>

    <p>He and Yan are both dragon-born. They are the incarnations that symbolize the dragon inheritance in the early days of the ages. They are well versed in the way of power.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he also knew how difficult it was for a cultivator to reach such a height as a monk. Therefore, Jingze's originally relaxed and composed spirit gradually became tense in response to the monk's superhuman strength.</p>

    <p>He knew clearly. This was a test.</p>

    <p>This is a tough battle. But no matter how difficult the monk is to deal with, he and Yan will defeat the monk in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Yan. You alone can't deal with this monk. We need to join forces." Jingze said coldly. He had already put on his diamond gloves and was about to take action.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Jin Deng raised his hand. The golden Buddha light in the sky instantly turned into a Buddha's palm a hundred miles wide. He quickly rushed to Jingze, crushing him with a devastating force.</p>

    <p>"The palm technique that falls from the sky!"</p>

    <p>Jingze frowned. The monk's movements were too fast. He just sat there and used the golden Buddha's light all over the sky in this boundless Buddhist court to his advantage! Accurately achieve long-range strikes!</p>

    <p>This is an expression of using the supreme world to its extreme. It can be said that at this time, the monk and the supreme world are no longer separate from each other. The two are one and can be used for each other.</p>

    <p>Yan took a breath, inflating her belly, and then exhaled. A long dragon-shaped pillar of fire spurted out from her mouth.</p>

    <p>This time the pillar of fire accurately hit Monk Jin Deng's body. However, at the moment when the flames burned the monk, his body turned into a blur and turned into a seven-color auspicious cloud. After the flames disappeared, that part disappeared. The body has returned to its original form.</p>

    <p>"Is this? The virtual and the real..." In the distance, Jingze broke away from the palm that fell from the sky. He turned into lightning and quickly moved forward to bring Yan back to him.</p>

    <p>He can no longer let Yan do such useless work. Every next step must be done step by step. This monk is not easy to deal with. It is useless to just bite the bullet and be reckless.</p>

    <p>Although the Dragonborn's spiritual energy is as huge as the sea, it is not inexhaustible.</p>

    <p>After all, one of them is only 1 year old and the other is only 7 months old. Jingze does not have the confidence to compare with the advanced monk in front of him.</p>

    <p>Compared to Jin Deng, the only advantage their dragonborn have is their bloodline.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Jingze is very cautious. Even though he is very strong, he does not act rashly.</p>

    <p>"He is a difficult person to deal with..."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng opened his eyes. The word "Âçç" appeared in both pupils.</p>

    <p>It has been a long time since he used the swastika. The last time he opened his eyes was to get a glimpse of the universe of Wang Ling. As a result, he only saw a trace of the outline and became blind in one eye.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he suddenly realized the past, present, and future three Buddha fires. He used the power of Buddha fire to repair the scrapped swastika.</p>

    <p>Now when he sacrificed the swastika again, he was dealing with two dragon descendants.</p>

    <p>He has enough confidence.</p>

    <p>This time, his swastika will never be scrapped again.</p>

    <p>Brush!</p>

    <p>Jingze took the descendant of Yan, leaving an afterimage on the spot. When his body stabilized, he could feel the monk's terrifying swastika eye power from a distance.</p>

    <p>"Yan. Listen to my command. We are going to sacrifice our Dragonborn's Chaos Weapon next. Otherwise, we will not be a match for this monk." Jingze said. To be honest, he never thought that Jin Deng would be so difficult to deal with before coming here.</p>

    <p>But now when Jin Deng opened his swastika, Jingze recognized the fact instantly.</p>

    <p>This monk cannot be defeated with their current combat power. The only way to find an opportunity is to use the Dragonborn Chaos Weapon!</p>

    <p>He calls out!</p>

    <p>At this time, a powerful golden light penetrated out of the swastika. It rushed towards Jingze and Yan with a breath that purified everything.</p>

    <p>Then Jingze saw the swastikas in the monk's pupils spinning. Dozens of golden objects were instantly summoned from the pupils! They were lingering around him!</p>

    <p>These golden objects have the same appearance. They emit golden light. Each one is carved with a completely different Buddha head pattern on its body. Some have kind eyebrows and kind eyes, some are fierce and evil, some are gentle and careful, or some are angry...</p>

    <p>These are eighty-eight relic vajra pestles refined from the most sacred relics of Buddhism in the past! At this time, all eighty-eight vajra pestles appeared behind monk Jin Deng. The heads of the pestles rotated, aiming at Jingze and Yan.</p>

    <p>In an instant, a Buddhist temple seemed to appear behind Jin Deng. Countless Buddhist images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas appeared. It was so shocking that it was beyond belief.</p>

    <p>What a powerful force this is...</p>

    <p>To cultivate to such an extent with a mortal body is simply unimaginable to Jingze.</p>

    <p>What frightened Jingze the most was that the monk in front of him used all his strength in his attack, without any thought of his back-up plan!</p>

    <p>At this time, his gaze is fixed!</p>

    <p>Eighty-eight relic vajra pestles behind them were launched towards them intensively like missiles!</p>

    <p>"This monk..."</p>

    <p>Jingze is speechless.</p>

    <p>I am speechless towards Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>As promised, monks are compassionate!</p>

    <p>This is all a lie...</p>

    <p>They are just two dragonborn aged 1 year old and 7 months old.</p>

    <p>Two little dragonborn babies. What evil intentions could they have?</p>
