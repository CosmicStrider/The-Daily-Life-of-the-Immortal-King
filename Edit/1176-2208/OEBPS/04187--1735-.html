  <h1>Chapter 1735 The sudden dumpling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned. She stared at the child in front of her who was looked to be only six years old. But she kept staring at the child who called her mother. She was deeply shocked: "Brother Ming... you arranged this... Lotus root person?"</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about? Rongrong. This was not arranged by me. Although I do have this idea, I assure you that I did not create this little guy." Wang Ming raised his head and said: "I just looked at this experiment. Research data in the room. They should be conducting dragon bone gene synthesis experiments..."</p>

    <p>"In other words, this child is also a dragonborn?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. And... he has all the abilities of the Dragonborn. It's just that their data shows that this experiment has failed 1,624,600 times... Who knows we just invaded here. This little guy It was hatched." Wang Ming said dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, she was a little overwhelmed by the current situation. It was her fault that such a thing happened to her. This was something Sun Rong did not expect.</p>

    <p>"Mom, mom..."</p>

    <p>The little guy in front of her was still chattering and calling her. He even opened his little hands to ask her to hug him.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the face that looked so much like Wang Ling. She hesitated for a while, but finally picked him up.</p>

    <p>The child needed coaxing. She decided to explain to him as gently as possible that she was not his mother: "Listen, little one. I am actually not..."</p>

    <p>As a result, she didn't finish her words. The little guy said directly: "My name is Wang Muyu. My father's name is Wang Ling. My mother's name is Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>She was not stupid. She immediately knew that this was definitely the system that was inputting part of the memory in her mind at the same time as it was forming facial features data. This caused the little guy to start thinking about his life experience.</p>

    <p>Things are getting complicated...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned, with mixed feelings in her heart. At the same time, she looked at Wang Ming with confusion: "Brother Ming. Why does Wang Ling's great shielding technique not work on him?"</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling's Great Shielding Technique can limit the prying eyes of most humans and upper-level cultivators. But this little guy is an omnipotent dragon created by combining the power of all dragons... To limit him, I'm afraid it will take a few more improvements." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Mom, mom... who is this person?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu seemed to be particularly sensitive when he heard Wang Ming say something like "restrict him." At the same time, he stared at Wang Ming. He began to be a little wary, showing a defensive attitude. Then he looked at Wang Ming seriously. Ming asked: "Are you... a mistress?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>This little guy is not very old, but he knows a lot!</p>

    <p>They complained at the same time. Why did this system instill so many strange things into his memory?</p>

    <p>Due to Wang Ming's silence for a moment, the little guy's mood suddenly changed. His seven-color dragon horns and dragon tail turned into fiery red. He said in his soft and childish Mandarin: "You... Male mistress! You stole my mother! I'll beat you to death!"</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A powerful spiritual energy burst out from his body. It filled the entire laboratory in an instant like a flood.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was surprised in her heart. She felt Wang Muyu's body temperature rising sharply. Then she suddenly felt her hands were hot and had to let go of Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>The little guy who was let go became more ferocious. His eyes also turned fiery red. The color of his eyes was exactly the same as Wang Ling's. The serious and unsmiling little face bore a striking resemblance at this moment.</p>

    <p>At that moment, even Wang Ming felt in a trance.</p>

    <p>He had watched Wang Ling grow up. And now he was staring at Wang Muyu in front of him. If it weren't for the dragon horns on his head and the dragon tail behind his back, he would really think that this was Wang Ling when he was six years old.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong! Protect me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's face turned pale with shock. This little guy was terrifyingly powerful.</p>

    <p>Even if he merged with the divine brain, he couldn't restrain it. When his mental power was tested, it was actually disintegrated by an invisible magnetic barrier.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's body combines the genes of various dragon powers. The Magnetic Shield Dragon is just one of them. While fighting, the magnetic field on his body will open at the same time, forming a barrier that can block the intrusion of all mental powers.</p>

    <p>"Aohai! Protect Brother Ming!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong reacted quickly. With a thought in her mind, a sea of sea water immediately surrounded Wang Ming and formed a magic ball to wrap it up.</p>

    <p>However, soon she suddenly felt a huge force organizing herself, trying to disintegrate the magic ball.</p>

    <p>This is... the power of Cangyuan Dragon?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was secretly surprised. This little guy actually had the genes of Cangyuan Dragon, one of the three leaders of the dragon clan, incorporated into his body. He was also trying to use the power of Cangyuan Dragon to destroy her magic ball.</p>

    <p>"It's not an option to keep entangled like this, Brother Ming..."</p>

    <p>"I don't know, Rongrong. Why don't you confess?"</p>

    <p>"I'm only sixteen years old... How can I admit this kind of thing casually!"</p>

    <p>She was a little anxious. It wasn't because she couldn't resist. All the power of the nine-core Aohai was sent out. It was easy to deal with such a little baby.</p>

    <p>But if she unleashed an offensive here, she was worried that the entire laboratory would be destroyed. A bunch of data might be destroyed by then.</p>

    <p>After all, the purpose of their coming to the Sky Level Laboratory was not entirely for the dragon bones. They were also looking for some information to study the new Talisman.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, she still had good intentions and didn't want to hurt the innocent little guy in front of her.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu was created by these thoughtful people, he was also an innocent party.</p>

    <p>There is no other way...</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong frowned and stared at Wang Muyu: "You... don't you even listen to your mother? I told you to stop!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was deeply moved.</p>

    <p>I feel that Sun Rong's sacrifice is too great...</p>

    <p>This stern rebuke was extremely effective.</p>

    <p>Mother's majesty was still there. There was an effect of calming oneself without anger. Wang Muyu's fiery red dragon horns and tail immediately faded and turned into seven colors again.</p>

    <p>"Mom..." he shouted softly. This voice made people unable to get angry at all.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong picked him up again and scolded him sternly: "This person is not the mistress you mentioned... he is your Uncle Wang Ming!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, so that's it. Where's my dad?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu asked reluctantly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong was in despair.</p>

    <p>But she didn't want to irritate the little dragon man too much. She could only use one lie to cover another lie: "Your father is waiting outside. We need to find some information now. Once we find the information, we can go out and meet him..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I understand!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu nodded. Then he pointed in a direction: "There is a core secret room here. I will take you there!"</p>

    <p>"The core chamber?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. It's where all the data is stored."</p>

    <p>Then he said. He stretched out his little hand and gently pressed on Wang Ming's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu used his ability to move in space to directly bring Sun Rong and Wang Ming into the entire sky-level laboratory. The most confidential area...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, outside the Sky Level Laboratory, Wang Ling was waiting outside eagerly.</p>

    <p>Although the huge dragon-bearded monster had been turned white and not even a trace of ash was left. But for some reason, he felt an ominous premonition...</p>
