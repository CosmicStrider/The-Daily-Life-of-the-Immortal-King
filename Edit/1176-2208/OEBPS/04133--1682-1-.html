  <h1>Chapter 1682 The most powerful sniper in the universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the brain is gradually activated. The giant of the Ancient God became more and more oppressive. He stood tall. His huge head exudes a certain unspeakable majesty, and he carries an aura of supremacy with his hands and feet. Like Pangu in the myth of the opening of the heavens and the earth.</p>

    <p>At least in Jiugong Liangzi's opinion, there is not much difference between the two.</p>

    <p>She hid in the inner world of monk Jin Deng. Together with Sun Rong. Compared with Sun Rong, who was already used to it, the shock in Jiugong Liangzi's heart could not be greater.</p>

    <p>Only those who have experienced it personally can understand it.</p>

    <p>Such a magnificent scene. Jiugong Liangzi is aware of her own training and talent. If I hadn't met Zhuo Yi, Sun Rong, Wang Ling and the members of the Office of Strategic Deception, I 'm afraid I would never have seen it in my lifetime.</p>

    <p>---</p>

    <p>The visual impact of such close proximity. The sense of pressure and shock is really amazing. Far from the cultivator Zhenren in the cultivation of cinema real battle + CG special effects that fictional scene can be compared.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. Don't be too nervous. We are still very safe in the core world of senior Jin Deng." Sun Rong reassured on the side.</p>

    <p>In fact, with her current combat power and protected by Aohai's sword energy, she doesn't need the protection of the core world at all. But senior Jin Deng still kept her here. In fact, she also understood the meaning of this.</p>

    <p>I just want her to comfort Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>As a young cultivator, it is indeed easy to get addicted when watching such a big scene for the first time.</p>

    <p>It can easily lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and adrenaline hormone overload.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt the same way at first. How could I not understand?</p>

    <p>But now... I'm used to it just by looking at it.</p>

    <p>And in the follow-up. As far as Sun Rong's own conjecture is concerned, with Zhuo Yi's personality, which at first glance is like a peerless good man doting on his wife, there is a high probability that Jiugong Liangzi will apply for many "girlfriend-only benefits." It is certain that the realm will advance by leaps and bounds. Maybe there are all kinds of magic weapons in hand that make people envious...</p>

    <p>Of course. In fact, what Sun Rong is envious of is not his combat power, spells, or magic weapons.</p>

    <p>As long as she is willing to rely on these things, she feels that Wang Ling will never be so stingy to her.</p>

    <p>So the point remains. Spoiled!</p>

    <p>A girl, a young girl, of course, wants nothing more than to be pampered...</p>

    <p>Is she short on money to buy all these blinding spells, magic spells?</p>

    <p>She just hoped that the log would be a little more forthcoming sometime...</p>

    <p>But for now, Sun Rong thinks this is a luxury.</p>

    <p>"The activation of the divine brain is about to reach 100%. Today I will tell you how powerful it is to have the strongest divine brain in the universe." At this time, the voice of Nawei came from the body of the ancient god giant. It was a kind of The mental fluctuations radiated through brain waves. He never spoke, but his voice was transmitted to everyone's ears.</p>

    <p>Then, in a state visible to everyone's naked eyes, the body of the Ancient God Giant was extremely concentrated.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment for it to shrink to the size of a normal person.</p>

    <p>This is a smaller version of the Ancient God Titan. But it is more capable than the original.</p>

    <p>"It actually condensed the New Ancient Divine Weapons absorbed into the body into the size of cell particles on the body..." Monk Jin Deng frowned. He could tell at a glance what the changes in Nawei were.</p>

    <p>A total of 27,000 New Ancient Divine Weapons. After being compressed by the divine brain, they became only cell-sized. This also means that Nawei's physical body is stronger than before! It's like a quilt. A compressed sponge. When the density is smaller, its strength also becomes stronger!</p>

    <p>Of course. This is not the scariest thing.</p>

    <p>The scariest thing is of course.</p>

    <p>These New Ancient Divine Weapons, which are transformed into cell particles, can really divide continuously in the body like human cells!</p>

    <p>Even if a New Ancient Divine Weapons only has Dao God level strength...</p>

    <p>Perhaps when 27,000 Dao Gods merge into one, the Office of Strategic Deception may still have room to contend with the combined efforts of everyone. But if they continue to divide...</p>

    <p>In the end, there will be hundreds of millions, or even tens of billions, or hundreds of billions. The outcome is hard to say.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that this was the idea from the very beginning of the fusion." Er Ha also began to become nervous. Although the Nawei in front of him became smaller, it was compressed and was undergoing continuous division in the body. Its aura continues to superimpose and become stronger and stronger. On the contrary, it is even more difficult to deal with than the original ancient god giant.</p>

    <p>Nawei shrunk into the size of a normal humanoid. His appearance has also changed. He is extremely handsome and charming. He is white all over. Tight and precise muscles are carved on his body piece by piece. They are very similar. A piece of sculpture art.</p>

    <p>He was wearing nothing on his upper body. The white robe was just hanging down, hanging down on his waist. From a distance, it looked like a holy white skirt.</p>

    <p>The original Nawei is an old man with a mole. Who would have thought that after fusing so many New Ancient Divine Weapons, his appearance and body would undergo fundamental changes.</p>

    <p>At this time, his silver hair was flowing down, exuding an astonishing domineering power, and his white robes were swinging in the wind without modification. With one step, he was thunderous, and the wind swept the remaining clouds. He used his body as a guide to turn into a ray of light towards Monk Jin Deng. Impact away.</p>

    <p>This speed is astonishing. It is like thunder on flat ground!</p>

    <p>The speed is even more amazing than shrinking to an inch!</p>

    <p>Although Monk Jin Deng had reacted quickly when Nawei made the move, he had not yet grasped the appropriateness to respond to this move. After just a hasty palm strike, an astonishing explosion exploded from the palm strike.</p>

    <p>In an instant!</p>

    <p>Centered on the explosion point where the two palms met, a bottomless pit with a radius of tens of feet appeared out of thin air in the highest world.</p>

    <p>Then there is the influence of the law of the supreme world that is constantly shrinking and repairing.</p>

    <p>This palm was full of impact. After the palm, a trace of blood oozed from the corner of Monk Jin Deng's mouth, but he was still capable of fighting.</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception also knows that Nawei's divine brain will only become stronger after it is activated to 100%.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this battle must end as soon as possible. It cannot be delayed any longer.</p>

    <p>"Everyone gather fire! Let's go together!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Diulei spoke. In this case, there was no need for strategy and command. Since he decided to focus the fire, he naturally used his unique skills.</p>

    <p>As for the Office of Strategic Deception, everyone's cooperation is also very tacit.</p>

    <p>As if it was agreed in advance, everyone turned their attention to Zhou Ziyi on the side.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi immediately raised his hands in a gesture of surrender: "Seniors... you... what do you want to do..."</p>

    <p>In desperation, there was no need to explain anymore.</p>

    <p>"Ziyi. You obey." Zhuo Yi immediately picked up Zhou Ziyi's collar and threw it directly to Monk Jin Deng: "Come on, Ziyi. Let's go!"</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng took over Zhou Ziyi. He stepped forward and applied a 100% consecration technique on Zhou Ziyi! + a large concentration technique! It actually condensed Zhou Ziyi directly into the size of a sniper rifle bullet!</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhou Ziyi finally understood what this group of people wanted to do...</p>

    <p>However, he was unable to resist at all.</p>

    <p>Because the next second, he had been loaded by Xiang Yi and stuffed into the Nine Sun Divine Sword.</p>

    <p>"I'm here to help too!"</p>

    <p>Then, Lord Diulei gave Zhou Ziyi a copy of the effect of his enhanced soul-suppressing ring, adding a buff! In case anything unexpected happens to Zhou Ziyi, he can be resurrected immediately on the spot!</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha transformed into his dog form again and used the swallowing technique to grow his mouth. Let Xiang Yi enter its mouth to shoot!</p>

    <p>Breathing Technique + Sniper Rifle Blocking. The combination of these two powers will produce a turret effect similar to a big horn!</p>

    <p>"I'm here to help too!" Everyone got on. As a koi, Qin Zhong certainly couldn't sit idly by. He also jumped into Er Ha's mouth. Together with Xiang Yi, he held the Nine Sun Divine Sword!</p>

    <p>And that's when the trigger was pulled!</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan and Leng Ming took action at the same time!</p>

    <p>The power of a Shadow doubles the power of the bullet!</p>

    <p>The other one used his sword energy to clear the way for the bullet to avoid interference from foreign objects!</p>

    <p>So. The next second!</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a loud bang!</p>

    <p>The most powerful bullet in the universe. It was shot from the Nine Sun Divine Sword. It was accurately shot at Nawei's head...</p>
