  <h1>Chapter 1575 Now, I can't explain clearly.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the power of 1% Fenmu Shen is far less than that of the main body, it is enough to deal with a few earthlings.</p>

    <p>In front of the villa. One percent Fenmu Shen appears here.</p>

    <p>Those purple evil eyes emitted a faint light, analyzing the entire villa.</p>

    <p>Everything was as Fenmu Shen thought. Wang Nuan's body was casting a shadow spell. The little girl had no time to take care of herself when this spell could not be interrupted.</p>

    <p>Now in this villa, except for some strange spirits, there are no other masters.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen originally thought that Father Wang and Mother Wang were very powerful. However, after further analysis, she discovered that these couples were actually Muggles.</p>

    <p>It's only at the level of the body refining period...</p>

    <p>Now that the earth has been upgraded, the level of the planes has risen to a higher level. Fenmu Shen feels even more miraculous that a state like this can still exist during the body refining stage.</p>

    <p>He felt that after a period of body refining, he might be able to serve as the Dragon King's son-in-law in ordinary novels.</p>

    <p>But in the world of the Immortal King, he is not even worthy of being alive.</p>

    <p>"Are they just two ordinary earthlings?" Fenmu Shen had a somewhat disappointed look in his eyes. He thought that the source of all evil could give birth to two cosmic monsters in succession. Their strength level should not be too low.</p>

    <p>The result was unimaginable. They turned out to be two losers.</p>

    <p>This made Fenmu Shen very disappointed. But at the same time, he felt lucky.</p>

    <p>Since it is waste, then there are thousands of ways to deal with waste, even with one percent of his power.</p>

    <p>Among the two of them, Father Wang and Mother Wang, one percent Fenmu Shen has decided to kill one first as a warning to others.</p>

    <p>Kill that male Earthling first...</p>

    <p>Then pin down Mother Wang and use it to threaten Wang Nuan and Wang Ling. This is the best strategy Fenmu Shen has thought of so far.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the villa. After Mother Wang gave birth to Wang Nuan successfully, Immortal Toya was relieved.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi are still doing postpartum care for Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>In fact, childbirth is not that troublesome for cultivators. There is no such thing as confinement.</p>

    <p>Ever since Mother Wang became pregnant with Wang Nuan, the most indispensable thing for the Wang family is supplements. Just those pills given by Mr. Sun, the boss of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Just one pill is enough for Mother Wang to quickly regain her strength after giving birth.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is a "Golden Needle Acupuncture Set" presented by Taoist Taiyi, a master of acupuncture in the world of cultivation who is known as the "Dragon King of the East Huaxiu Sea." Mother Wang will be able to return to the original state immediately within today. Maybe even the realm that has not been broken for a long time can be restored. All can achieve breakthroughs.</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya was teaching Father Wang how to acupoint.</p>

    <p>"After ten o'clock tonight, I will start with the Taijia Xuan Needle. Just prick the acupuncture points every hour."</p>

    <p>"Understood." Father Wang nodded: "This Taijia Xuan Needle is followed by Taiyi Xuan Needle. Then Tai C Xuan Needle, Tai Ding Xuan Needle, Tai E Xuan Needle... I've memorized it all."</p>

    <p>"That's very good." Immortal Toya nodded.</p>

    <p>This is the first time for him to take over such a ceremonial delivery scene...</p>

    <p>And even though he came to deliver the baby, he actually didn't help much. He just helped with post-operative cleaning and disinfection.</p>

    <p>Because Nuan Zhenren slipped out of the uterus on his own after the baby was old enough. He even tied the umbilical cord into a Chinese knot.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, he inexplicably entered the trance mode. It was like falling asleep.</p>

    <p>And when she was born, Wang Nuan's body was clean. There wasn't even a trace of blood or dirt on her body. She looked like a little angel who had descended into the world.</p>

    <p>Even with all his years of practice, Immortal Toya has never seen such a magical scene.</p>

    <p>It is said that a daughter is her father's little cotton-padded jacket.</p>

    <p>Now seeing the birth of Wang Nuan, Immortal Toya was particularly touched for a moment. In fact, he actually had the idea of finding a marriage partner, settling down and having a baby.</p>

    <p>And the best. Also a daughter.</p>

    <p>So good.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations again to Senior Wang for getting a little cotton-padded jacket." Immortal Toya bowed his hands.</p>

    <p>"Thank you Immortal Toya for your hard work." Father Wang raised his hand and returned the gift. His face was full of joy, but he couldn't help but reveal a bit of a wry smile.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether their daughter was a little cotton-padded jacket.</p>

    <p>But it is definitely a small explosive that cannot escape...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Nuan neither cried nor fussed after he was born. He looked unusually quiet. This was a bit different from what Father Wang had imagined.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was noisy when he was born. As a result, he became autistic when he grew up.</p>

    <p>Everything has two sides. After Father Wang has experienced it, he knows that this may be an illusion...Ah Nuan girl may be a lively girl when she grows up.</p>

    <p>"Would you like to have a casual dinner together tonight?" At this time, Father Wang asked.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was flattered. He knew that such an opportunity did not come often. He did not dare to refuse: "Junior, it would be disrespectful!"</p>

    <p>"Don't talk like a junior." Father Wang scratched his head in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>To be honest...Immortal Toya is much older than him.</p>

    <p>Including Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>As a result, every time the two of them came to the Wang family's small villa, they would shout one after another. This made Father Wang feel like he didn't know what to do...</p>

    <p>He knows that all this is the result of imagination.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling and Wang Nuan were born one after another.</p>

    <p>Now their whole family has been imagined by this group of people as reclusive bosses...</p>

    <p>Father Wang used to think it was good to put on a disguise to hide your identity.</p>

    <p>But now that they are all so familiar, he feels that there is no need for it.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I'm younger than you. So are you and Diulei. There's no need to be so formal." Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the concept of "hidden boss" has long been ingrained in the minds of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it will be difficult to remove it for a while.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "How dare I..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang's showdown: "I'm actually in the body-refining stage..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Senior is joking again."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Come to the kitchen. Father Wang is planning to prepare ingredients for the evening.</p>

    <p>The person who worked the hardest today was Mother Wang. So Father Wang decided to cook it himself.</p>

    <p>It's not that he doesn't know how to cook. It's just that he's usually too lazy to do it. At most, he just helps out.</p>

    <p>But today alone, Father Wang still wanted to let Mother Wang take a good rest. During this time, he also asked for leave and stopped coding.</p>

    <p>Instead, save all your energy and strength to spend with your family.</p>

    <p>"Senior, do you need help?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"Just sit down." Father Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>I just took out a few potatoes from the bag and picked up the kitchen knife. The villa's alarm suddenly sounded.</p>

    <p>Is someone illegally intruding?</p>

    <p>Father Wang's brows furrowed slightly. He went out with the kitchen knife in hand and opened the door of the villa.</p>

    <p>What Father Wang didn't expect was that what greeted him was an energy ball that looked dazzling than the sun.</p>

    <p>"Go to hell..."</p>

    <p>One percent Fenmu Shen only stretched out one finger and created this extremely terrifying "Eastern Wave."</p>

    <p>Kill Father Wang. More than enough.</p>

    <p>As long as it is hit by this "eastern wave", the hit object will be instantly swept into the space and smashed to pieces.</p>

    <p>Without causing large-scale damage, this single-point spell is what Fenmu Shen thinks is the most ideal.</p>

    <p>"What is this?"</p>

    <p>Looking at the rapidly approaching light group, Father Wang was so shocked that the kitchen knife dropped to the ground. He subconsciously raised his arm to block it.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>After a crisp sound, the ball of light was smashed to pieces by Father Wang's arm like a golf ball.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang did not expect that the "Qilin Arm" that Wang Ling gave him enlightenment before leaving would actually play a key role.</p>

    <p>This situation made Fenmu Shen one percent stunned.</p>

    <p>What the hell is this...the body refining period?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya, who was behind Father Wang, looked at him with admiration: "Senior, you are so strong! I knew you were always being modest!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Now, it seems that his status as a big boss cannot be explained clearly...</p>
