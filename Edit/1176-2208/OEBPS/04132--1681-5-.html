  <h1>Chapter 1681 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Several asylum students suddenly changed their colors. This was too strong. It was basically a dimensionality reduction attack.</p>

    <p>Number 002's combat power has reached the upper-middle level among the creatures they housed. However, under the Chaos Millstone, even the lowest level 99 spell cannot be withstood.</p>

    <p>When the fire bamboo of the God-Burying Fire rose up from the ground that day, it was accompanied by a hell-like devouring fire. It was so hot that it swallowed up the sky and the earth together. The other contained creatures jumped away instantly and hid as far away as possible.</p>

    <p>As for Number 002, who was hit with a targeted and precise attack, he was not so lucky.</p>

    <p>When he looked back, he had been reduced to ashes. The place where he died had turned into a sea of fire. From a distance, it was submerged by the breath of the Dao. Various laws of order were intertwined, forming a forbidden area that no one dared to easily enter.</p>

    <p>Not to mention being hit head-on by the pillar of fire from the Sky Burial Divine Fire. Even the sea of embers and fire left behind after the pillar of fire was not something any of their sheltered creatures could withstand.</p>

    <p>One of them was killed instantly.</p>

    <p>There are now a total of eight remaining sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>And. No one can escape.</p>

    <p>At the same time that the millstone was sacrificed, Wang Ying also appeared. He folded his arms and observed secretly.</p>

    <p>He was glad that he chose to return to Wang Ling's body...otherwise, he might have ended up with these sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>Because this Chaos Millstone is also an ability he has never possessed. He can tell that this Millstone is a product derived from King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>As a shadow, the only thing that cannot be copied from Wang Ling is the King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>He never thought that this man's King's Eyes could actually derive such a magical object.</p>

    <p>A chaos device with 97% of the power of chaos, nearly 100% of it. Just looking at it makes you feel like you have given up hope of survival.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is.</p>

    <p>These seemingly fearless sheltered creatures were actually forced to learn to speak human language at this moment. They knelt down and begged Wang Ling for mercy: "We... were wrong..."</p>

    <p>Several sheltered creatures knelt on the ground.</p>

    <p>Although they have been making strange noises and not saying a word since the beginning of the battle, it does not mean that they cannot speak human language.</p>

    <p>Deep down, these sheltered creatures still have a kind of contempt for human cultivators. They believe that human cultivators are just low-level creatures derived from the Great Dao.</p>

    <p>But now, when such "low-level creatures" appear in front of them with such crushing destructive power, the sense of fear that arises spontaneously, and the resulting sense of awe, make them have to Wang Ling bowed his head in front of him and surrendered. He gave up all dignity and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at a few sheltered creatures without saying a word.</p>

    <p>He is not some devil.</p>

    <p>I did think of leaving a few of the "old world" hostages behind for further study.</p>

    <p>The ones surrendered now. They're "005, 007 and 009" hostages. And they're all from the old days.</p>

    <p>This is exactly what Wang Ling wants.</p>

    <p>So he used King's Eyes to move away the death star locked on the three sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Millstone received the order almost immediately. It canceled the punishment for the three sheltered creatures and dispersed a golden light to protect the three sheltered creatures from being affected.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the next round of punishment began again.</p>

    <p>From the chaotic millstone, the indifferent female voice came again. It conveyed a kind of supreme pressure. It seemed to represent the heavens: "Congratulations. Creature No. SCB-003. You are about to be punished by a level 188 spell." The punishment spell is: Eight-note Death Knell. The spell will be configured after 1 second."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A huge black ancient bell appeared in the void. It was a faint virtual image, but it carried an extremely terrifying death threat.</p>

    <p>An invisible sound wave came accurately. It contained eight different sins and emotions: arrogance, jealousy, anger, laziness, greed, lust, gluttony... and not voting.</p>

    <p>These eight sins and emotions were outlined together. They were integrated. They condensed into a hemp rope and converged into a terrifying torrential sound. It swallowed up Number 003 at once. It was directly hit by the sound wave, and then disintegrated into particles of dust.</p>

    <p>Before he died, he let out an extremely shrill scream and tried to use his own means to resist. However, such resistance was simply a thorn in the side of a tree.</p>

    <p>Because Number 003 faced a level 188 directional spell.</p>

    <p>Being shaken into powder under the sound wave. This kind of pain is tantamount to Ling Chi...</p>

    <p>No! More painful than Lingchi!</p>

    <p>Especially during the period before death, you will feel as if there are countless knives stuck in your body, dividing the flesh bit by bit.</p>

    <p>This is a ruthless massacre and annihilation.</p>

    <p>And at the moment Number 003 was solved, several new sheltered creatures knelt down and chose to surrender.</p>

    <p>But this time, the Chaos Mill did not stop inflicting its own punishment.</p>

    <p>The redemption mechanism of Chaos Millstone exists. But it does not mean that there is no limit to redemption.</p>

    <p>After failing to surrender voluntarily for the first time, Chaos Millstone will automatically add those who have not surrendered to its blacklist. By then, it will be too late.</p>

    <p>Even with the consent of Wang Ling, the millstone cannot be stopped.</p>

    <p>Unless the entire Chaos Millstone is destroyed.</p>

    <p>Facing these creatures from the old factions, it is naturally impossible for Wang Ling to destroy the millstone. The chaos millstone will still be of great use in the future.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that the chance of redemption is in your own hands.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After finishing the third containment creature, Wang Ling opened the King's Eyes space again. Collect the surrendered Number 005, 007 and 009 in his own King's Eyes space.</p>

    <p>The rest. Everything in the world of the heavens can be easily taken care of by the Chaos Millstone.</p>

    <p>The most important battle next is the battlefield on the other side.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan could have his hair burned off or bruised at any time. No matter how paralyzed his brother was, he couldn't just sit back and watch.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that since Ah Nuan was born. He seems to have indeed changed a bit.</p>

    <p>It seems that he can feel a little bit of the warmth of human kindness that he never cared about in the past.</p>

    <p>I just don't know why. He still feels stuck sometimes.</p>

    <p>Especially when he saw Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There's a knot in your heart that can't be untied.</p>

    <p>Sometimes. It even makes him ache for a while.</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling calls it "evil relationship" ... From what he can tell. It doesn't seem to have been broken so easily.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself didn't realize it.</p>

    <p>Unconsciously, some people, have entered, his life...</p>

    <p>She shines, in a world of darkness, she seems to shine less brightly.</p>

    <p>But even so.</p>

    <p>That little bit of light, at this time, is the only light in the world.</p>

    <p>At that moment. When Wang Ling opened his eyes again.</p>

    <p>The view. The world of the Ancient God Giant. He has locked it down...</p>

    <p>Below.</p>

    <p>That's right. Time for the show.</p>
