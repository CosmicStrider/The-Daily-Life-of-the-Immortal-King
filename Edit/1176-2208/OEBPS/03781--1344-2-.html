  <h1>Chapter 1344 Love Experience Exchange Meeting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's straightforwardness and sharp tongue are things that Sun Rong does not have.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that she is indeed the shadow of the Sun Rong girl... The difference in personality is really obvious.</p>

    <p>And the key point is that although Sun Ying'er has a venomous tongue, Liu Qingyi can't get angry at all.</p>

    <p>Ying'er's voice was too soft. Even if she heard something outrageous, she would just want to pinch this girl's face.</p>

    <p>"Girl Sun Rong. If your personality can complement your shadow, I think it might work." Liu Qingyi smiled in the face-to-face video.</p>

    <p>"What?" Sun Rong felt inexplicably hot.</p>

    <p>"With Ling Zhenren! With wood like that, you have to take the initiative to drill nails into it. Only then will the relationship be strong!" Liu Qingyi analyzed.</p>

    <p>"That's right!" Sun Ying'er supported.</p>

    <p>"Girl Ying'er can actually help." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>"Help? Forget it... I still want to live a few more days!"</p>

    <p>Thinking of Wang Ying's terrible punishment, Sun Ying'er became scared: "One day, if I get permission, I will definitely make Wang Ying look good! I have to teach him a lesson!"</p>

    <p>"Miss Ying'er wants to teach Master of Shadows a lesson. I'm afraid it's not as easy as imagined." Liu Qingyi smiled and said: "And how do I feel? In fact, you don't seem to hate Master of Shadows."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Sun Ying'er was instantly excited. Sun Rong saw Sun Ying'er in the shadow state. The outline of the shadow was no longer smooth.</p>

    <p>It was as if Liu Qingyi had said something to his mind. The outline of the shadow looked like a kitten with fried fur. He suddenly became excited.</p>

    <p>"Who said that! The one I hate the most is him!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Sun Ying'er slipped through the gap as if running away. She didn't know what she was doing.</p>

    <p>In front of the screen. Liu Qingyi laughed so hard: "I finally understand why the Master of Shadows likes to bully the Ying'er girl."</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"This reaction is so cute! Even when I ran away, my shadow was red!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi laughed loudly: "Actually, maybe even Miss Ying'er didn't expect it. She might have fallen in love with Master of Shadows."</p>

    <p>"Ah? No way... Wang Ying bullied him like that..." Sun Rong covered her mouth slightly.</p>

    <p>"If she really hates it, why is she blushing?" Liu Qingyi clicked her tongue. She looked like she had seen through everything: "It seems that these shadows are going to start fighting first. You two masters also have to work hard."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liu... what are you talking about..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong touched his face. He felt that the temperature began to rise again.</p>

    <p>"If you don't understand anything, you can ask me at any time. I'll finish my tutoring today, Miss Sun." Liu Qingyi smiled and then ended the video chat.</p>

    <p>The time was fixed at about three o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>She chatted with Sun Rong for less than an hour.</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, along with the words "Video call has been terminated" appeared. Liu Qingyi also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The problem with Sun Rong is finally over.</p>

    <p>The matter between her and Wang Zhen has not been resolved yet!</p>

    <p>The Wang family is indeed made of wood...</p>

    <p>She has already hinted so obviously. Wouldn't Wang Zhen take the initiative?</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi felt very tired.</p>

    <p>However, she also has her own principles.</p>

    <p>In emotional matters, the one who speaks first will definitely lose.</p>

    <p>So she would never speak to Wang Zhen first!</p>

    <p>Instead, he has to wait for Wang Zhen to take the initiative to confess to himself!</p>

    <p>So in this case, it is very important to have a wingman who can make people jealous!</p>

    <p>"Senior Gu." At this time, Liu Qingyi turned his attention to Gu Shunzhi who was watching a drama.</p>

    <p>When Gu Shunzhi was called by Liu Qingyi, goosebumps arose all over his body again: "Miss Liu, what's the matter..."</p>

    <p>"How about going shopping with me today at noon? Let's be a couple for a day?" Liu Qingyi asked.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi choked hard on the Feizhai Happy Water. The expression on his face was extremely shocked: "... Love? Couple?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Ying'er, who was blushing after being talked about, hid aside and wrote a self-criticism.</p>

    <p>Her first review was written under the supervision of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Although the words she wrote were sincere, they were not from her heart.</p>

    <p>But now that Wang Ying is not around, Sun Ying'er can finally speak freely.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ying is a big pervert! Wang Ying is a big pervert... Wang Ying! Big! Change! Abnormality!" Sun Ying'er wrote a self-criticism all by himself while mumbling words.</p>

    <p>800-word review.</p>

    <p>She repeated the words "Wang Ying is a pervert" 160 times...</p>

    <p>Then throw the pen smoothly.</p>

    <p>Hey-hey!</p>

    <p>Finish!!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's still Wednesday, December 2nd. It's five o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He already knows. The memory over there at Sun Rong has not been erased...</p>

    <p>Everyone rushed to help Sun Rong. This made Wang Ling himself very embarrassed.</p>

    <p>A traitor among the crowd is not the scariest thing.</p>

    <p>The most terrifying thing is that everyone is a traitor...</p>

    <p>However, to put it bluntly, these people are all friends of Wang Ling. Wang Ling would not necessarily do anything excessive to their friends.</p>

    <p>So in this dilemma situation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling subconsciously thinks of escape.</p>

    <p>Although it is shameful to escape, it is useful!</p>

    <p>For several hours, Wang Ling has been studying the BUG problem of his {Single Curse}.</p>

    <p>He decided to carry out another loophole repair work on {Single Curse}...</p>

    <p>It's not difficult for Wang Ling to develop spells.</p>

    <p>Checking for vulnerabilities is more difficult.</p>

    <p>Because there are many loopholes in spells that need to be discovered through practice.</p>

    <p>This Wang Ling was used too few times. Every time it was used, loopholes were discovered. Wang Ling only filled it later.</p>

    <p>Just at five o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has filled in the loopholes of the {{Single Curse}}.</p>

    <p>{Single Curse}The bug of the last reverse confession will never appear...</p>

    <p>Now, all you have to do is put the aura of the {Single Spell} on yourself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Believe that you can completely become an insulator in love.</p>

    <p>"Is this really good? I feel like something will happen."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was lying on Wang Ling's bed. He put his head on his arm and asked.</p>

    <p>He said he was concerned about Wang Ling. But in fact, he was only thinking about Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>There are still 16 hours left before the 406th planet wall bang will be executed at 8pm tonight.</p>

    <p>16 hours is 960 minutes. That is 57,600 seconds...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying always has a timer in his heart.</p>

    <p>Regarding "bullying" Sun Ying'er, he felt that he was a bit addicted.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why I could give birth to such a character...</p>

    <p>Regarding Wang Ying. Wang Ling, I feel like I can't understand it more and more.</p>

    <p>This straightforward personality makes it easy for problems to arise in the future!</p>

    <p>But it's not convenient for him to ask about matters between shadows.</p>

    <p>Anyway, now. This {Single Curse} has been upgraded...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's anxious heart finally relaxed slightly.</p>

    <p>This time, there should be no more bugs!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Mr. Sun, the boss of Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>After receiving a secret reminder from Sun Ying'er, I finally remembered Wang Ling's last confession.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be this kid!" The old man rubbed his hands.</p>

    <p>He has always been quite satisfied with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But even if Sun Rong is interested in Wang Ling, he, as a grandfather, cannot force boys to like their granddaughter!</p>

    <p>They are only 16 years old!</p>

    <p>There is still a long road ahead!</p>

    <p>"Come here, send me an internal secret." Boss Sun raised his arms and shouted.</p>

    <p>"Sir, what's the matter?" Jiang Xiaoche asked.</p>

    <p>"There is a young man named Wang Ling. Wherever he goes from now on, as long as it is under our Huaguo Shuilian Group... all services will be upgraded to the highest level. All charges will be borne by our group."</p>

    <p>"All rates? Including booking a room?" Jiang Xiaoche said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Wang, that's not the kind of thing a student would do! You get out!"</p>

    <p>The old man kicked Jiang Xiao Che's butt.</p>
