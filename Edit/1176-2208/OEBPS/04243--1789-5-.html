  <h1>Chapter 1789 Meili died again today - Meili's death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the beginning, Levis admitted that he just wanted to make the Huaguo Shuilian Group disgusted. He knew that the strength of the Chilan Society was not enough to bring down such a huge consortium that was gaining momentum. Moreover, it might lead to death.</p>

    <p>So he could only find a way to disgust the other side. Chilan would find a way to continue to survive in Glio City.</p>

    <p>But now that the Tengu forces have intervened, and with the support of the largest cultivation country, all kinds of forces are coming in one after another. The clergy of the church, the cultivation country... all revolve around the relationship between the Chilan Society and the Huaguo Shuilian Group. The grievances between the two unfolded.</p>

    <p>It seems that compared to being simply disgusting, there is nothing more exciting than watching a huge consortium sink like a sun that has lost its energy.</p>

    <p>And Levi's believes that moving to the Huaguo Shuilian Group will inevitably cause a chain reaction. Even the Office of Strategic Deception will also suffer.</p>

    <p>A consortium force. A super sect. The scene of both of them falling gives Levi an exciting feeling just thinking about it. This battle is no different from the six major factions besieging Guangmingding... The only difference is the ending.</p>

    <p>Levi's thought they had a high probability of victory.</p>

    <p>Chilan Club has been developing in Glio City for so many years, relying on illegal transactions to accumulate capital. In the past two years, Levi's has gradually realized that this is not a long-term solution. He wants to let Chilan Club develop for a long time. We can only get rid of the cloak of the mafia little by little and begin to realize transformation.</p>

    <p>And now what was before him was an excellent opportunity.</p>

    <p>With Tengu's power and eye-witnesses all over the world, if he can perform outstandingly in this operation, the Chilan Society will be able to complete the cleansing under his leadership.</p>

    <p>"Alley, you know what my purpose is in deploying in so many industries over the years." Levis took a deep breath. He stood in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window and asked, looking at the drizzle falling outside the window.</p>

    <p>"Tengu. Knows everything."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said with an expressionless face: "As long as President Levi cooperates with us sincerely, helping the Chilan Society to transform is just a matter of effort for us."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Since it's not convenient for you to come forward for the time being, I will take care of all the wolf hunting and fishing."</p>

    <p>Levis looked at Sister Alley and muttered: "But this is the last time."</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley nodded: "I just hope President Levi will not waver."</p>

    <p>"Waver?"</p>

    <p>Levis smiled: "Don't worry. I am a mature businessman. I will not do anything treacherous. Chilan will develop for so many years. I am the only president. Brothers are willing to follow me. Sister Alley should know what I am like."</p>

    <p>"It's natural. I don't mean anything else. It's just a reminder."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said: "As far as we know, the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family, Jiugong Liangzi, is already on her way to Glio City. Because she is not a member of the Office of Strategic Deception, she is not restricted from entering."</p>

    <p>"Oh. It turns out to be her." Levi suddenly said, "I have some impressions of this little girl. I heard that she had a falling out with Miss Sun of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, and then the two families formed an alliance inexplicably. I thought the two of them was just a pretense, in order to stabilize the stock price, I didnâ€™t expect that Miss Jiugong was willing to wade into this muddy water."</p>

    <p>"This is not surprising. According to the information we have received, Miss Jiugong Liangzi is in a relationship with a core member of the Office of Strategic Deception. But the specific identity is still under investigation."</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>Levis nodded. He already knew it.</p>

    <p>In his eyes, she is just a little girl. Be it the Jiugong family or the Sun family, no matter how powerful these two consortiums are, Glio City is their territory.</p>

    <p>Facing two little girls who are inexperienced in the world, Levi has enough confidence to defeat them until... there is no recovery.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At nine o'clock in the morning, an armed bus specially prepared for Number 60 High School people appeared in front of the Volute Hotel on time.</p>

    <p>This was urgently mobilized by Butler Lin last night. As the name suggests, it is a bus armed to the teeth.</p>

    <p>The glass of the bus is specially made. It is not only bulletproof but also blastproof. The most important thing is that the entire bus uses an amphibious system. It can run, dive and fly...</p>

    <p>In addition, additional psychic barriers, anti-missile systems and defense devices are installed on the roof.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this fancy configuration. He couldn't help sighing in his heart. But when he thought about it carefully, Butler Lin was an uninformed person. There was really nothing he could do about it.</p>

    <p>The enemies are crazy when they are ruthless. Today's evil elements are always in the Soul Formation realm. The overall mystery and comprehensive quality of the Soul Formation realm are directly reduced to the price of cabbage.</p>

    <p>Although these people are not worth mentioning in front of Wang Ling, ordinary defensive measures are ineffective against the Soul Formation environment. Wang Ling does not think these security measures are of any use. But it seems that they can at least give Butler Lin some psychological comfort.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin also made the travel plan last night. He tried his best to find places with a lot of people. The first stop was Walwolf, which Wang Ling had not been to before.</p>

    <p>Yesterday he did not buy the "No one knows better than me the crispy noodles series crispy noodle snack gift pack." The first stop today was arranged here. Wang Ling was very satisfied.</p>

    <p>"Everyone can buy whatever they want. Not just snacks. Just take it. The most important thing in life is to be happy." Sun Rong, who has restarted the rich woman mode, said with a smile.</p>

    <p>While speaking, Wang Ling could feel that the girl's whole body was glowing... and it was the kind of radiance that a female Bodhisattva could bring to save all sentient beings.</p>

    <p>This armed bus does not have a driver. It uses an intelligent driving mode combined with Beidou navigation. It is safe and stable. It looks bulky but actually operates extremely smoothly. It gives people a very safe feeling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was sitting in the last row of the bus. Wang Muyu sat obediently on Wang Ling's lap... This scene made Sun Rong envious.</p>

    <p>She knows. Normal people don't get this treatment...</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Muyu can do it. If it were anyone else, they would definitely be pushed down by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Wang Ling has such a good relationship with his brother." Guo Hao couldn't help but sigh when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>"Really, don't talk about the younger brother. I don't think it's a crime for Muyu to call Wang Ling "Daddy"." Chen Chao spread his hands.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When the armed bus was driving on the highway, Wang Ling, who was sitting comfortably in the back seat, suddenly realized that something seemed wrong with the route.</p>

    <p>He has already been to Walwolf once. He still knows the route very well.</p>

    <p>As a result, the route taken by the armed bus seemed to be a long way.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin. Did it yaw? Why does it feel like it's going further and further away?" The two of them had a good rapport. Soon Sun Rong also felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin was sweating profusely. When he checked the posture function, his face changed drastically: "Oh no! This... this automatic driving. Why can't I control it?"</p>

    <p>He screamed. Everyone in the car was shocked: "This... this navigation system is wrong! It's not Beidou navigation at all! I clearly installed the Beidou navigation system!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, inside the armed bus, a clear and somewhat cunning and beaten electronic voice came from the bus: "Hello! - Bad Navigation. At your service!"</p>
