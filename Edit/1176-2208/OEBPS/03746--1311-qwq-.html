  <h1>Chapter 1311 Lord Gray Mist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Buried in the soil has always been a big worry.</p>

    <p>That is, not only does his name sound very tacky, but his appearance also looks exactly like a prairie dog.</p>

    <p>This resulted in Tu Limi always having a very low self-esteem.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he learned to use the power of chaos in his body to merge with the gray mist in the air to hide his true body that he regained his confidence bit by bit.</p>

    <p>That's right. Buried in the soil.</p>

    <p>It is the real name that the gray mist creatures hate so much.</p>

    <p>Now, he has changed his name to: Gray Mist Lord.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang gave him three names casually at the beginning. It was relatively good to bury him in the ground.</p>

    <p>Originally, Dao Ancestor planned to call him Tu Jian Buri, or Tu Li Jian Zi... but the gray mist creature resolutely refused.</p>

    <p>He thinks his name should be more domineering!</p>

    <p>However, Dao Ancestor doesn't seem to think so.</p>

    <p>After Dao Ancestor Wang gave birth to him, he was only favored by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that he was a fighting beast.</p>

    <p>But Dao Ancestor Wang seems to just regard him as a mascot for fun when he is bored.</p>

    <p>They even launched a series of "pig raising" plans against him at one time!</p>

    <p>When he was first born, he weighed less than 10 pounds.</p>

    <p>With the efforts of Dao Ancestor Wang, he was raised to five tons alive.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the gray mist creatures had another alias from that time: tons tons tons tons tons...</p>

    <p>Just ask!</p>

    <p>Is there any more miserable beast in this world than him?</p>

    <p>As a mythical beast whose appearance is 99.99% similar to that of a prairie dog, the prairie dog feels extremely painful.</p>

    <p>And all of this changed after Dao Ancestor Wang entered reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Using the gray fog to hide his identity, Woodchuck began the path of establishing a fierce persona for himself.</p>

    <p>He is not willing to be an ordinary "groundhog" anymore!</p>

    <p>So. He changed his name and started to become a mysterious creature hidden in the gray mist... "Gray Mist Lord!"</p>

    <p>For thousands of years, the prairie dog has worked hard to subvert his pet persona and shape himself into a mysterious and ferocious creature wrapped in gray mist.</p>

    <p>He made a big fuss in Heaven. He even harassed the Gods Abandoned Land several times. He left a deep impression on the Cat in the Abandoned Land and all the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>And after the Heavenly Dao Golden Men passed through constant changes, the "mystery" he created became more and more outrageous, and the description of him became more and more terrifying.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how many years have passed. The groundhog... oh no. It's Mr. Gray Mist!</p>

    <p>He finally changed his appearance and got rid of his identity as a pet beast!</p>

    <p>Now the powerful Heavenly Dao revealed his true face. This made him unable to accept it no matter what!</p>

    <p>"Who is it! Who revealed his true appearance!" Lord Gray Mist was furious.</p>

    <p>He has murderous intentions in his heart. He wants to destroy all the Heavenly DaoGolden Men here who know his true appearance!</p>

    <p>However, at the critical moment, Mr. Gray Mist still remained calm.</p>

    <p>He had endured it for so many years. He finally changed his face and hid his ugly appearance as a prairie dog... He endured it for a while longer. From these Heavenly Dao's mouths, he found out who was the culprit behind revealing his identity. It's not too late.</p>

    <p>"Haha. It's because I'm too violent. It's really disgraceful."</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Mr. Gray Mist withdrew the claws on Heavenly Dao's neck. At the same time, the density of the gray mist became thicker.</p>

    <p>He's putting pressure on Heavenly Dao around here.</p>

    <p>"Let's do it. We can discuss the whitelist of the three heads of the God's Domain."</p>

    <p>At this time, Mr. Gray Mist, who was hidden under the mysterious gray mist, smiled slightly: "I just need you to tell me, who is supporting you? If I know the answer today, I will give up. Otherwise, I will let you know today. There is no peace in heaven."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, several of the main hosts, Heavenly Dao, felt speechless.</p>

    <p>Who is behind this? Isn't it obvious...</p>

    <p>You are a mythical beast beside Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Don't have any AC numbers?</p>

    <p>You yourself go to the Land Abandoned by the Gods and fish out the heads of the three God's Domain families...</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, it is impossible not to know the existence of Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Of course. Power Heavenly Dao then thought about it and suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>Because of the existence of the "Great Shielding Technique." In fact, the six Dao Gods who were crushed to death still don't know Ling Zhenren's true identity...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that these six people died too quickly!</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist actually didn't see how these six people died!</p>

    <p>"It seems that this groundhog still doesn't know the truth of the matter."</p>

    <p>In the mental space. Power Heavenly Dao couldn't help laughing at this time: "And this girl has a criminal record..."</p>

    <p>"He just wants to cause trouble." Space Heavenly Dao couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>In the past, prairie dogs actually had the behavior of forcibly going to the land abandoned by God to "protect people", and then taking the little brother they saved to cause trouble everywhere.</p>

    <p>He relied on his own strength and thought he could disrupt the land abandoned by God.</p>

    <p>Let Heavenly Dao obey his orders obediently.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he developed a arrogant personality.</p>

    <p>To the prairie dog, it doesn't matter how these people ended up in the Forsaken Land.</p>

    <p>Because as the "boss", he has the ability to fish out everyone who goes in.</p>

    <p>Only this time. The Marmot didn't expect that the luxury Titanic cruise ship he was driving... was about to hit a big iceberg!</p>

    <p>"How is it? Everyone? Do you want to say something?" Power Heavenly Dao was actually still hesitating.</p>

    <p>"This is a good opportunity." Time Heavenly Dao laughed at this time, Ling Zhenren is actually waiting for us to sell him out ...... As far as I know, that Qingtong cat in the Abandoned Land just made a deal with Ling Zhenren, only that Ling Zhenren doesn't have a reason to make a move right now."</p>

    <p>"you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Just talking is not enough. You have to anger this groundhog and make him cause trouble. Only then will Ling Zhenren have a reason to deal with him."</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space, several themes are combined into one Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>So, their plan on how to deal with the "groundhog" in front of them suddenly became clear in their minds.</p>

    <p>"Lord Gray Mist, please calm down. It's not that we don't want to say it. It's just that if we say it, I'm afraid... hey..." Power Heavenly Dao said with a sad tone.</p>

    <p>"What are you afraid of?"</p>

    <p>The groundhog wondered.</p>

    <p>"That senior is difficult to deal with..." Power Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is said intentionally.</p>

    <p>Their current purpose is to incite this prairie dog to actively fight Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Eh? In this world, apart from the monk on Earth, who is also worth mentioning. He can compete with me. Who else can be my opponent? Of course! If it weren't for the restriction left by Dao Ancestor on Earth. Let my strength be reduced. The monk went to other places and let me meet him... He will also die!"</p>

    <p>The groundhog was very unconvinced. He put his hand on his waist and said, "Tell me! Who is this person? I will destroy him!"</p>

    <p>"Senior, can you destroy him? That will really be a great thing for my heaven. I believe Dao Ancestor will be pleased to hear it!" Power Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"Just kill one person. If you are a real master, I will kill each one for free!" The prairie dog sneered. His paws could not wait to kill the person that Power Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>How dare you reveal his identity...</p>

    <p>He wants to dig out this man's eyes! Take out his heart!</p>

    <p>Then he would trap this person in his black mist forever and ever, and become his Gray Mist Lord's slave!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>
