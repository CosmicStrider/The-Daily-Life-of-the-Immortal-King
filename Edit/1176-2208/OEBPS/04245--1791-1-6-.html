  <h1>Chapter 1791 I didn't expect that Meili would die after one chapter.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sudden appearance of the giant beast from the center of the earth plunged the city of Glio into a sudden accident. Its body was surging with pure blue energy. Its mountain-like backbone was constantly flashing, revealing a wild atmosphere.</p>

    <p>The powerful spiritual pressure is overwhelming. It brings great oppression to everyone on the earth except Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>A catastrophe is coming. The garrison base has to respond quickly to counterattack in self-defense.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, several fighter jets took off from the base and headed towards the behemoth from the center of the earth. Psychic missiles were fired from all directions, passing by with a harsh sound of friction with the air.</p>

    <p>The giant beast from the center of the earth frowned slightly. It roared in a low voice. It opened up a space and formed a world of its own. In the end, all these psychic missiles bombarded the barrier it opened.</p>

    <p>It has never taken the initiative to launch an attack. It stands in front of the garrison base. It is an active deterrent and seems to be guarding something. It makes the sky and the earth tremble, and it has an unimaginable power.</p>

    <p>"What on earth does it want to do... stand on the street!"</p>

    <p>"No. Such a huge beast can't come out of the ground out of thin air just to scare us!"</p>

    <p>"Is it because its hands are too short to use its left jab on us?"</p>

    <p>"Then it's even more impossible... Anyway, it's not actively attacking us now. We'd better not take action."</p>

    <p>Their psychic missile attack is originally ineffective. Continuous firing is nothing more than a waste of ammunition. The driver is still more realistic. It needs to be considered based on the actual situation.</p>

    <p>After all, in Ultraman, it is Ultraman's light wave that finally defeats the monster, not the fighter's missile. Except for the ultimate move launched by Ultraman at the end, the previous scene of flying a fighter jet to attack the monster is nothing more than water... And tell the audience in a subtle way, using missiles to fight monsters is to fight loneliness.</p>

    <p>Since the giant beast from the center of the earth did not take the initiative, the entire garrison base also stopped the next round of attacks. At the same time, everyone was speculating on the true intention of this giant beast.</p>

    <p>Where does it come from?</p>

    <p>And why would they suddenly launch an offensive here?</p>

    <p>When will reinforcements arrive?</p>

    <p>These are all problems.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current results, this is obviously a confrontation.</p>

    <p>As for how long the confrontation will take, no one can predict it.</p>

    <p>At this time, the armed bus Wang Ling was riding in was retreating. It did not stop and watch from a distance until it reached a safe location.</p>

    <p>This was not a restoration of control of the armed bus. It was a spontaneous act by the unscrupulous navigation.</p>

    <p>The evil navigation originally contains artificial intelligence ai. And Wang Ling discovered it early on. Although this navigation is evil, it is extremely afraid of death.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he directly summoned such a giant beast from the center of the earth to block the entrance of the garrison base. It had no choice but to retreat and keep a safe distance.</p>

    <p>"So you're also afraid of death?" Fang Xing sat at the front.</p>

    <p>He crossed his arms and stared at the steering wheel of the bus.</p>

    <p>Bad Navigation never replied.</p>

    <p>"Fang Xing. What are you doing...talking to a navigation..." Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"This is not an ordinary navigation. It is a navigation with artificial intelligence." Fang Xing said, "Look, after this giant beast appeared, the armed bus has been retreating. This can only prove one point. It is scared."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Guo Hao nodded.</p>

    <p>"But this guy is still pretending to be dead. He refuses to cooperate. He doesn't say a word. I don't know if you can do anything about it."</p>

    <p>"This is easy to handle. It's just a torture system. I'm familiar with it!" Guo Hao laughed gloomily.</p>

    <p>Then he opened the display inside the armed bus, pulled out the link device, and took out a dark USB flash drive from his pocket.</p>

    <p>"What is this?"Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Known as the system sector of the deep water bomb, originally an uncle of mine taught me this tricky method." Guo Hao said: "Inside the installation is the Teng smoked computer butler, thousand degrees of security assistant, 361 security guards and Yinshan Viper, the four security software giants within the 214 computer antivirus security software ..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Fang Xing, Chen Chao, Li Youyue: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Of course it will be fine if you only install one anti-virus software.</p>

    <p>But if you install and run it at the same time, something terrible will happen! Haven't you ever been curious about what would happen if you let these anti-virus software kill itself? "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the Bad Navigator couldn't help but start to tremble a little.</p>

    <p>As a newly born artificial intelligence AI, it has not experienced the wonderful prosperity and beauty of the world. It does not want to die like this.</p>

    <p>If so many anti-virus software were installed in its body at the same time, what kind of consequences would it produce? It was hard for the bad navigation to even imagine it.</p>

    <p>When that time comes, I'm afraid these anti-virus software will directly follow the system and cause its core to crash...</p>

    <p>It's so scary!</p>

    <p>Boohoo!</p>

    <p>These people have no heart!</p>

    <p>Are they all devils?</p>

    <p>Just as Guo Hao was about to plug the USB drive in, the unethical navigator finally couldn't resist the pressure and said, "Wait... young hero! I'm sorry, but I don't know what to say! Don't move your hand! If you insert it so recklessly, I will die of pain!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Bad Navigation: "What do you want to know? I'll tell you! As long as you don't put weird things into my body! That's right! That's right! The person who instigated me to do this is the Chilan Society! The president's name is Levi's! My father It's him too!"</p>

    <p>"dad?"</p>

    <p>"Because he is my developer..."</p>

    <p>"He has several wives. He lives a disorderly life! He is an out-and-out scumbag! Please, young heroes, be sure to annihilate him!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone in the armed bus was in shock.</p>

    <p>Good guy...</p>

    <p>A loving father and a filial son.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, at the end of the horizon, a man with long blond hair, wearing a dark blue uniform and white trousers appeared. His clothes were fluttering, dancing in the strong wind, coming on the wind.</p>

    <p>"Reinforcements are coming! It's General Maiko Assi!" someone at the garrison base exclaimed.</p>

    <p>This is the Army General of the Mixiu Country Cultivation Corps! Maiko Assi! He is a legend in Mixiu Country!</p>

    <p>He is a famous strategic commanding genius. He has never failed in combat commanding in his life. He entered the True Immortal realm a long time ago and cultivated to the top of the Nine Levels Peak.</p>

    <p>Now that the earth has been upgraded, the level of combat power is no longer restricted. No one knows how high the level of this legendary general has been raised.</p>

    <p>"Evil beast."</p>

    <p>He came from the sky. His whole body was radiating golden light. He was like the sun god. There was a kind of arrogance in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi has been in seclusion for a period of time since the earth was upgraded. But he has just come out of seclusion. The opponent in front of him is this giant beast that appears inexplicably. A sense of excitement surges through his body.</p>

    <p>"Today, I am here. No matter who you are appointed by, along with the people behind you, I will definitely eradicate you!" He shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>The next second, the dark blue uniform behind him in the void was shrouded in a halo of flames. Like a golden crow!</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that the war is about to start. A battle between a legendary figure and a giant beast is about to begin!</p>
