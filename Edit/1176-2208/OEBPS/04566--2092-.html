  <h1>Chapter 2092 Space Betrayer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhang Zhui spoke eloquently. Tell everything.</p>

    <p>According to current popular discourse, to put it bluntly, there is no doubt that the behavior of former Feng Hua (now Bai Yinshou) does have the flavor of what Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>Low emotional intelligence: dog-licking behavior.</p>

    <p>High EQ: Consensual liking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened to everything. He felt that this operation... seemed a bit familiar. It almost reminded him of Sun Rong at this moment.</p>

    <p>It feels like what Zhang Zhui said is all it takes to report the ID number of Sun Rong. But there is no evidence.</p>

    <p>But to be honest. For Sun Rong...Wang Ling, I think this may not be wishful thinking. To like someone wishfully is to give one-sidedly and never get a response.</p>

    <p>To Sun Rong. Wang Ling, I feel that the relationship between me and her now should be a pure friendship.</p>

    <p>Is there no pure friendship between boys and girls?</p>

    <p>Do you have to have love and love?</p>

    <p>He feels that he and Sun Rong are in good shape now.</p>

    <p>And he owed those favors. They were all turned into toffee and sent back.</p>

    <p>To each other. It is a state of helping each other.</p>

    <p>Now he has a useful place to get Sun Rong. And Sun Rong can also help him provide good cover.</p>

    <p>It is also an important source of supply of crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>This is a collaboration between close allies.</p>

    <p>It is a strategic partnership.</p>

    <p>Fall in love.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not interested.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for him to fall in love in this life.</p>

    <p>Living a Neptune life like Zhang Zhui. Wang Ling would not feel the slightest envy.</p>

    <p>All in all, it's nice to be alone.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the ancestral land of the Sun family. Sun Rong sneezed hard.</p>

    <p>Ice Purgatory. Thanks to the restoration by Zhenyuan Immortal people, it was almost completely restored to its original state. It is absolutely no different from what I saw before.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is amazed by this ingenious repair process. It is also the accumulated experience of Zhenyuan immortal and his team who have worked tirelessly to play the real version of "Minecraft" on Drought Star again and again.</p>

    <p>She has been taking care of Sun Yiyuan. I wonder what happened to Wang Ling deep in the ancestral land. Has the identity of the founder of the Sun family been verified?</p>

    <p>On the other side of the Internet, the public opinion news Sun Rong here is one that has not been missed and everyone is paying attention to it.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. There's something big going on in the Hai restricted area. It's about to start a fight! Muyu, Zhang Zhui, and Yue Lingwei have formed a team!"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong felt that Sun Ying'er had been watching too many of those useless idol variety shows recently. He quickly asked: "Who is Yue Lingwei?"</p>

    <p>"It's Ling Zhenren's real clone!"</p>

    <p>So there is such a thing as a nesting doll clone?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>She knew that the real clone would greatly reduce the original basic combat power.</p>

    <p>But after all, the real body is Wang Ling. Even if this discount is applied, it is still an existence that crushes all living beings.</p>

    <p>As for Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's clone, I don't know how powerful Sun Rong is. But there is a high probability that this Moon Spirit Crisis is also an extremely powerful existence.</p>

    <p>"What does it look like?" Sun Rong was curious.</p>

    <p>He knows. Crispy Noodles Dao Lord looks very similar to Wang Ling. But in fact, the real clones have their own thoughts and ideas.</p>

    <p>So the ordinary Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is a little different from Wang Ling. He is taller and more mature. It can be seen as the kind of social elite version Wang Ling who is already working.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Sun Ying'er didn't mention the appearance of the new real clone Yue Lingwei, she knew that it must have other characteristics.</p>

    <p>"It's the pure ancient style Ling Zhenren! The one with long hair!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>Since it can be directly synchronized with Wang Ying's side, Sun Ying'er is very clear about the current situation under control.</p>

    <p>This conversation made Sun Rong fall into endless imagination. Long hair...ancient Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It feels a bit nice!</p>

    <p>But appreciation is appreciation. What she really likes...is the original body that is currently busy in the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>Why did she fall in love with some bloody romance novels like a substitute because her main body didn't like it? This would never happen in her life!</p>

    <p>The Old Sun family is always proactive! And they are dedicated proactive individuals! She will not give up as long as there is even the slightest chance!</p>

    <p>If it doesn't work in one year, just two years! If it doesn't work in two years, then ten years... She felt that as long as she was sincere enough.</p>

    <p>One day, this piece of wood will be able to awaken. "Rongrong..." At this moment, Sun Yiyuan called out.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, are you awake?" Sun Rong hurriedly walked over. At the same time, he was secretly rejoicing in his heart. I am grateful to the Zhenyuan Immortal people for their speed in repairing the ancestral land. Not only was it repaired quickly! It was also perfect!</p>

    <p>"Why...there are so many people?" Boss Sun opened his eyes and saw Zhenyuan immortal, Zhuo Yi standing in front of him. A look of surprise appeared on his face.</p>

    <p>He looked at Zhenyuan. He felt a little familiar, but he didn't recognize it completely: "Zhuo Yi I know. Who is this?"</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, I'm sorry. Senior Zhuo and this... elder of the Office of Strategic Deception. I entrusted Lord Diulei to invite them here." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>After saying that, Zhenyuan Immortal secretly gave Sun Rong a like.</p>

    <p>That's a perfect explanation. And it's not a lie.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was originally one of the elders of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Although he is a legendary Venerated Immortal on the earth, his current state is even more transcendent. It is not just a Venerated Immortal state... But if this identity is directly revealed, the amount of information will be too much to let this newly awakened person Mr. Boss Sun quickly accepted.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong's mind turned very quickly. He quickly found a reasonable explanation: "I saw grandpa passed out. I had no choice but to ask for help from the True Lord. Then Senior Zhuo brought this elder over. I checked your injuries and said you are fine. I feel more relieved."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right." Sun Yiyuan nodded. He felt a little pain in his head. He even forgot what happened before.</p>

    <p>Here he was just about to stand up.</p>

    <p>The result is in the void of Ice Purgatory. A space crack is generated at this time...</p>

    <p>The incident happened suddenly, leaving everyone here confused.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan's reaction was extremely fast. He single-handedly protected everyone here behind him. He immediately set up a shield to prevent everyone from being sucked away by the sudden crack.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>Why did a space crack suddenly appear in Ice Purgatory?</p>

    <p>It shouldn't be...</p>

    <p>When repairing it, he had obviously checked the entire map.</p>

    <p>All spiritual pressure is very stable.</p>

    <p>Just after finishing wondering, a shining meteor slid directly into the map along the crack. It caused a huge earthquake in the front! The strong explosion and roar lasted for a long time. The ice purgatory was once again plunged into a sea of fire.</p>

    <p>The ravine that had been repaired before was opened again in front of Boss Sun...</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong discovered that not only the ice cracked again, but her grandfather also cracked.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa...Grandpa, please wake up..."</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Yiyuan fainting again. The expression on Sun Rong's face was also extremely complicated. She no longer knew how to describe it. She shook Sun Yiyuan's body. But Sun Yiyuan did not react at all.</p>

    <p>At this time, the crack that suddenly appeared in the void also disappeared.</p>

    <p>Instead, there was a figure stumbling towards them...</p>
