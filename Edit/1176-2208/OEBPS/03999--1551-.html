  <h1>Chapter 1551 The weird one among the eternal strong men</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At that time, Dao Ancestor Wang's "Method of Immortal Grip" only existed in theory.</p>

    <p>This is an unlimited imprinting powerful resurrection technique.</p>

    <p>By shaking hands, the engraving can be placed.</p>

    <p>You can increase your resurrection speed by constantly being "killed."</p>

    <p>And ultimately achieve a state of immortality.</p>

    <p>That is... even if the whole body has been shattered into pieces. Only a ball of fly ash is left.</p>

    <p>It can also be restored to the original state immediately within a few seconds.</p>

    <p>"As expected, the tombkeepers of the Sky Tomb are not ordinary people. I am looking down on you."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen stared at the old woman in front of her with her purple eyes.</p>

    <p>He was thoughtful and seemed to be planning something.</p>

    <p>"As long as I am here, you can't even think about stepping into the tomb behind this place."</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern sighed slightly.</p>

    <p>The next second, the flame of the lamp in her hand suddenly surged. It seemed to represent her anger and endless fighting spirit.</p>

    <p>The temperature in the nearby void continues to rise.</p>

    <p>This little lantern shines like a star, releasing endless light and heat.</p>

    <p>The surrounding space seemed to be burned, like window paper, melting holes one after another under the strong temperature.</p>

    <p>These burned space holes look chaotic.</p>

    <p>In fact, there are certain rules and ordering.</p>

    <p>The old woman holding a lantern arranged these caves into a formation and surrounded Fenmu Shen layer by layer.</p>

    <p>She tried to burn him completely with the flames of the Holy Flame!</p>

    <p>Since a large-scale attack is easily broken up by the "weak retreat" move.</p>

    <p>Now, it is the best choice to adopt a horse-fighting battle and launch attacks from all directions at the same time.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's expression remained unchanged.</p>

    <p>He stared at the lantern in the old woman's hand for a few seconds and opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>With a sound of "rua", he spit out a golden sword from his mouth and shot it straight upward!</p>

    <p>Then. There was a buzz!</p>

    <p>A golden rain of swords burst out and struck down densely.</p>

    <p>Wherever the sword energy of the golden sword passed, all the molten holes arranged by the old woman with the lantern were instantly cut open and disappeared.</p>

    <p>"You can't escape now." Fenmu Shen chuckled.</p>

    <p>I don't even pay attention to the old woman holding the lamp.</p>

    <p>Now that you already know the opponent's method of resurrection.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he had already thought of the way to solve it.</p>

    <p>His evil eyes are not blind.</p>

    <p>You can tell that the old woman in front of you is not a normal human being.</p>

    <p>If he judged correctly, the old woman and the lantern in her hand were one and the same...</p>

    <p>This is the weapon spirit of this lantern!</p>

    <p>The other party very cleverly transferred the "Grasp of Immortality" given by Dao Ancestor Wang to the lantern in his hand.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as long as you hold the lantern, the engraving effect will continue to activate, thus resurrecting continuously.</p>

    <p>This roundabout behavior may be for insurance.</p>

    <p>This will prevent this engraving from falling into the hands of others.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen never expected that he would be so lucky to meet him.</p>

    <p>"Old guy... everything you do will eventually become my stepping stone." He sneered.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he immediately stretched out a finger and wrote something in the void.</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern looked at this scene. Her expression changed drastically: "The law of death..."</p>

    <p>This is an extremely powerful curse-killing technique! And it is specifically targeted at weapon spirits!</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern did not expect that the other party would find out her identity...</p>

    <p>For these ten thousand years, she has maintained her body day and night, condensing herself into a body of flesh and blood to make herself look more like a human being.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that at this moment, Fenmu Shen would find out.</p>

    <p>When this "Death Order" was played, the old woman holding the lantern could clearly feel that an invisible decree was being generated in the space.</p>

    <p>No time to think at all.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen wrote the string of black ancient characters in the void. It turned into a long line of laws and decrees to suppress her!</p>

    <p>Huge earthquake in space!</p>

    <p>A strong sound erupted.</p>

    <p>The old woman was surrounded by a black light.</p>

    <p>The powerful power of the law radiated, and her whole body trembled. She felt that all the energy and blood in her body were evaporating.</p>

    <p>"No..." Her body could no longer hold up quickly.</p>

    <p>Under this powerful law of law, his true self manifested.</p>

    <p>"After all, you're just a junior." Fenmu Shen sneered.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he turned his hand and pressed it. The old woman holding the lantern fell to her knees on the spot under the words of the law directed at the weapon spirit. She could no longer lift the lantern in her hand.</p>

    <p>She saw Fenmu Shen's true intention. She used her last bit of strength to try to blow herself up!</p>

    <p>Although "Seal of the Immortal Grasp" is a method of resurrection, if you choose to commit suicide... you will not be able to be resurrected.</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern knew that Fenmu Shen wanted to take away the seal, so she made up her mind to destroy it together with the seal.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, she was still a step too late.</p>

    <p>At the same time as the lantern was released.</p>

    <p>The engraving on the lantern handle actually fell off instantly and flew towards Fenmu Shen's palm.</p>

    <p>Imprint transfer...</p>

    <p>The old woman's eyes were stunned. She didn't understand how the other party did it.</p>

    <p>"Your use value is gone."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen received the seal with satisfaction. He felt that his combat power was much stronger than before.</p>

    <p>He stared at the old woman, determined to give the old woman a good time.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the next second, the words of the law erupted, giving off a dazzling light.</p>

    <p>The old woman holding the lantern was instantly killed by the Law Order.</p>

    <p>Became dust in the universe...</p>

    <p>"Down below, no one will stop me from entering this tomb." Fenmu Shen smiled proudly.</p>

    <p>Then he took one step and stepped into the rift in space that he had longed for.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The agony of being disintegrated by the spell's laws is tantamount to capital punishment by delayed death.</p>

    <p>However, everything happened too suddenly.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was so powerful that the old woman could no longer scream.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this scream actually spread to other dimensions.</p>

    <p>In "The Place Abandoned by Gods", the bronze cat squatting on the Pillar of Gods Abandonment is licking its paws leisurely.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the place abandoned by God suddenly started to shake.</p>

    <p>The bronze cat's eyes shrank in alertness. It quickly jumped down from the pillar and began to search for the source of the vibration.</p>

    <p>The next second, it suddenly raised its head.</p>

    <p>Because this is not an earthquake. It is a feeling of vibration in the universe. It causes the entire God-Forsaken Land to shake...</p>

    <p>"Such a strange phenomenon. Could it be..." The bronze cat frowned.</p>

    <p>Then it saw in the dark sky of the land abandoned by the gods. Suddenly, another bright light flashed across like a meteor...</p>

    <p>An old woman whose whole body was ignited with divine fire. She was being roasted in the fire while letting out a scream of pain as she approached the place abandoned by the gods.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it's exactly what the bronze cat thought.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of resonance wave produced after someone's soul is ignited and falls into the place abandoned by God.</p>

    <p>It is actually a reminder of it. There are customers whose souls are burning. I hope it can go to remedy the situation.</p>

    <p>However, the old woman's soul burned too quickly.</p>

    <p>That soul has not completely fallen into the land abandoned by God.</p>

    <p>It was completely burned in mid-air...</p>

    <p>Even if the bronze cat wanted to save him, there was nothing he could do.</p>

    <p>"How could this be..."</p>

    <p>The despair of the old woman. It empathizes with it.</p>

    <p>As the person in charge of the God-Forsaken Land, it could only watch helplessly as its "customers" were burned to the ground.</p>

    <p>Such shrill screams and horrific death methods that went beyond the laws of the land abandoned by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Almost immediately, Bronze Cat thought of someone.</p>

    <p>"Did that person do it..." The bronze cat was still frightened.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, one day in an eternity, the evil god from back then would actually break out of the ground!</p>

    <p>That old woman holding the lantern is the guardian of the tomb!</p>

    <p>He was actually killed by the opponent so easily...</p>

    <p>The Bronze Cat thought this was unusual.</p>

    <p>The evil god reappeared. This is a big deal!</p>

    <p>You must find someone to discuss it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Otherwise there will be chaos in the universe...</p>

    <p>However, its movement is limited. It can only move within the area of the God-Forsaken Land.</p>

    <p>How to send this warning to people who are still alive is a question...</p>

    <p>So at this time, the Bronze Cat thought of another person.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Among all the regular customers in the Land Forsaken by God, there is one guy who comes and leaves as soon as he says it.</p>

    <p>Don't give it any face at all.</p>

    <p>This guy is none other than that stupid prairie dog...</p>

    <p>It is said that after changing his body, because he lost an important part, this guy is now autistic.</p>

    <p>It is still in a "petrified" state.</p>

    <p>This is actually in line with the bronze cat's wishes.</p>

    <p>Because in this way, it can actually penetrate directly into the soul to communicate with the groundhog.</p>

    <p>Even if you can't leave this god-forsaken place, you can still convey the message in place.</p>

    <p>But the premise is that after you convey it, you must ensure that the groundhog wakes up...</p>

    <p>At this time, the bronze cat sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>Isn't it just that that thing is missing?</p>

    <p>It doesn't know what there is to be autistic about.</p>

    <p>For cats, they can live longer without reproductive function.</p>

    <p>I remember he didn't say anything when he was castrated by Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>On the contrary, for the bronze cat, it was two less burdens.</p>

    <p>Its whole body is made of bronze. Sometimes when it runs, the bottom of its body will keep colliding with it like a bell, making a sound.</p>

    <p>This is so embarrassing.</p>

    <p>So. It's better not to have it at all.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the astrolabe. Zheng and the monk are playing chess in the living room.</p>

    <p>Zheng stared at the chessboard and said: "After this game, you can leave."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said, "I'm afraid this game will last for a long time."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is pouring tea. He looked like a pissed off little daughter-in-law. Can't even take a breath.</p>

    <p>Zheng's mansion has a modern human atmosphere. And every room is so huge... that you need to shrink the floor to enter the next room.</p>

    <p>There are many secrets about Zheng in the mansion. Before the monk finished visiting, he was dragged into the living room by Zheng to play chess.</p>

    <p>It is said to be a living room. In fact, this place is an endless sea.</p>

    <p>I heard that Zheng spent a huge amount of money to build it.</p>

    <p>It can be used as a living room. It can also be used as a swimming pool for swimming...</p>

    <p>There is a chessboard placed by the beach.</p>

    <p>The monk and Zheng. were playing chess on this beach.</p>

    <p>Zheng glanced at the monk: "If you want to eat fruit, please get it from the tree here."</p>

    <p>He rarely has guests here, so he designed the living room like this.</p>

    <p>As for the issue of preparing snacks when guests come, Zheng has also thought about it.</p>

    <p>He planted a fruit grove beside the beach.</p>

    <p>The fruits above are always in the freshest and ripest state. They are ready to be enjoyed at any time.</p>

    <p>The monk held a white piece in his hand. His eyes scanned the chessboard back and forth. He said without squinting, "Aren't you tired of pretending like this?"</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned slightly: "Monk. What do you mean."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng raised his eyes. He smiled slightly and said, "You should have cultivated into a human form long ago, right? In order to maintain your majesty, you still maintain your original appearance."</p>

    <p>ZhengHehe: "It's just a skin. No matter how beautiful the skin is, it is useless to me."</p>

    <p>After all, he is a person of eternity level. Appearance is what the world cares about. It doesn't matter to Zheng at all.</p>

    <p>Because he is a desireless person and has never thought about things like marrying a wife and having children.</p>

    <p>As a special dharma spirit, although Zheng has its own independent consciousness, it can also enjoy the rights that a normal creature should have as a living being.</p>

    <p>But the longer we live, the lighter many things become.</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned: "Monk. Are you delaying time on purpose?"</p>

    <p>He didn't expect the monk to ask this question. He was a little unhappy for a moment. He just wanted to send the monk away quickly so that he could be cleaner.</p>

    <p>"You always have to let the poor monk think carefully. Every move is crucial..."</p>

    <p>"..." Zheng's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>This was really the first time I saw him. He was still struggling to play backgammon!</p>

    <p>In fact, the monk was really stalling for time.</p>

    <p>Including the process of playing chess. From time to time, I have to add a little anecdote about family affairs. Everything is based on some subsequent considerations.</p>

    <p>And when the white seed in the monk's hand finally fell.</p>

    <p>The sea water here suddenly began to boil.</p>

    <p>"A great power has fallen." At this time, Zheng said while looking at the sea beside him.</p>

    <p>The sea water he arranged can capture the echoes of powerful people in the universe. Whenever a powerful person dies, a specific wave generated after the death of a powerful person will be captured by this sea water.</p>

    <p>"This sea without beginning is magical." The monk sighed: "This is probably not the first time you have seen it."</p>

    <p>"Someone dies every day, every moment... even every second."</p>

    <p>Zheng said: "There is nothing magical about the death of a great power. Even in the ancestral realm, it will just become dust in the universe after death."</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren looked at the boiling sea of the Sea of Beginning. He seemed to suddenly think of something. His face immediately became ugly.</p>

    <p>"You'd better be more honest. There is no future in hanging out with that kind of evil god."</p>

    <p>Zheng warned coldly, "If Dao Ancestor finds out about this. He would not spare you."</p>

    <p>"No... Brother Zheng. I thought of some bad things..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's face turned pale. He tried to use the power of starlight to call his physical body.</p>

    <p>As a result, I was shocked to find that my body had been moved!</p>

    <p>Not in the Devouring Star at all!</p>

    <p>"No! The celestial tomb has been discovered!" Peng Xiren was shocked.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?" Zheng's expression instantly became solemn.</p>

    <p>At this time, he looked at the monk, as if he already knew something. He gritted his teeth and said, "Monk, are you and the evil god a group? Did you know something a long time ago and are you here to delay time on purpose?"</p>

    <p>"You're only half right."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng smiled and said: "Delaying time. This is indeed the case. But how could the poor monk and the evil god be in the same group?"</p>

    <p>"You already knew he wanted to steal the tomb!"</p>

    <p>Zheng became excited: "You have never thought about the consequences! If the evil god gets the other half of his soul, how powerful he will become!"</p>

    <p>"It's better to be stronger." The monk smiled.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng was confused.</p>

    <p>"I came here to play chess with you. I really wanted to hold you back so that you would not be so anxious to seek death. As for the other side, Ling Zhenren is here," the monk said.</p>

    <p>Zheng looked suspicious: "That's the evil god..."</p>

    <p>The monk was also suspicious: "So what?"</p>

    <p>Zheng: "?"</p>

    <p>Monk: "Ling Zhenren said. This person is stronger. It will feel better to hit him."</p>

    <p>Zheng: "???"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling is really worried about two things.</p>

    <p>The first thing Jisaki informed was that the Rainbow Seven Gang would hold an upper-class student exchange meeting at noon to celebrate "Jiudaohe elected a five-member delegation."</p>

    <p>Thinking that I have to meet people I don't know again. Wang Ling makes my brain hurt.</p>

    <p>Then he heard that he would bring one of his magic weapons to the meeting at noon for display... This suddenly made Wang Ling's brain even more painful.</p>

    <p>He had no shortage of magic weapons. He was mainly afraid that if he took them out, he would blind these people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was going to take his own enlightened pants and jacket over there.</p>

    <p>But the proposal was immediately rejected by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"These pants are a godsend. Those people don't know what they're looking at. It's useless to give it to them." Wang Ming didn't want Wang Ling to take any of the magic treasures.</p>

    <p>Because it's cheaper to take it over to these people...</p>

    <p>This thermal underwear saved his life. Wang Ming still has memories of that incident.</p>

    <p>Is this group of people worthy of his brother's enlightened long johns?</p>

    <p>Are they worthy?</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling had no choice but to think of another way.</p>

    <p>He thinks it's not a good idea. He thought it would be better to let Jingke sacrifice his image... Among all his treasures. Jingke seems to be the only one who looks more ordinary and normal.</p>

    <p>In King's Pants, almost all of the magic weapons given to him by Heavenly Dao are luminous. You can tell at a glance that they are not ordinary objects.</p>

    <p>If those things were taken out, they would be too dazzling and stand out.</p>

    <p>But there is actually still a while until noon.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that maybe he will have a better idea later.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming went to study the small box outside the black stone. He happened to be the only one left in Jiudaohe's dormitory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this is a good opportunity to study the "Supreme Corpse Map."</p>

    <p>This is an eternal chaos weapon. It has infinite power when opened.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made complete preparations before opening it. He used King's Eyes to extract the space he was in separately, forming a kind of mirror space.</p>

    <p>This is an ability similar to parallel space. The Corpse Map will be expanded here. Even if an accident occurs, it will not affect reality.</p>

    <p>Of course. He hung Jingke on the dormitory door.</p>

    <p>It is true that the peach wood sword has the ability to ward off evil spirits. This is actually done to prevent the powerful resentment emanating from the Corpse Map from leaking out.</p>

    <p>These eternal powerful men were suppressed inside long time ago.</p>

    <p>Previously when Zheng opened it in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The sight of white bones wailing and struggling inside impressed Wang Ling deeply.</p>

    <p>These eternal strong men were forcibly suppressed in the picture. Since they could not escape, they could only gradually grow old and die in the picture, becoming a white skeleton inside.</p>

    <p>How sad this is.</p>

    <p>Although they cannot be defined as ghosts, one can imagine that the resentment among them is extremely heavy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has not fully opened the Corpse Map. This map is a thousand miles long at least.</p>

    <p>He only opened a small part, about two meters, and the chilling air of Xue Hai was already coming to his nostrils.</p>

    <p>"What an amazing picture." Wang Ying was also alarmed by the aura surrounding the Corpse Map. He took the initiative to manifest a figure next to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He folded his arms and stared at the bones in the picture.</p>

    <p>It only expanded two meters. There were no less than hundreds of bones inside.</p>

    <p>This Corpse Map has been passed down to this day. How many eternal warriors have been suppressed by this?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ying sighed in unison.</p>

    <p>Eternally strong. This sounds like a very rare existence.</p>

    <p>But the universe is so big. Compared to the vastness of the universe, these ancient powerful men are just a drop in the ocean.</p>

    <p>These suppressed eternal masters have been waiting for the Corpse Map to one day change hands to someone who is not so strong.</p>

    <p>They have been waiting for an opportunity in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>The existence of Zheng is a kind of psychological shadow for them.</p>

    <p>That extremely ugly Dharma Appearance Spirit. It looks terrible, and its strength is also terrifying.</p>

    <p>They don't want to be beaten to ashes when they go out.</p>

    <p>And now. When Wang Ling opens the Corpse Map by two meters.</p>

    <p>The sight before them made some people feel that the opportunity had come.</p>

    <p>"Corpse Map has changed hands! The opportunity has come!"</p>

    <p>A white and sinister hand seized the opportunity and stretched it out impatiently.</p>

    <p>"Haha. There are actually people who are willing to stretch out their hands to seek death." Wang Ying found it interesting. He also stretched out his hand and gave the bones a warm shake.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>This bone hand was directly crushed into powder by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. It was too forceful." Wang Ying apologized without sincerity.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Under this grip.</p>

    <p>The remaining bones in the picture have become much more honest. No one dares to stick their hands out anymore.</p>

    <p>On the edge. Wang Ling rolled his eyes at Wang Ying...</p>

    <p>Previously, Jingbai chopped the Corpse Map into pieces with a sword. In order to prevent these eternal masters in the map from leaving a psychological shadow.</p>

    <p>When repairing the Corpse Map, he used his pupil power to eliminate the scene of Jingbai slashing the map.</p>

    <p>In other words, all the eternal masters in the Corpse Map are now surrounded. They don't know what happened before.</p>

    <p>Now I opened the picture and saw Wang Ling and Wang Ying. Two teenagers who are identical to each other.</p>

    <p>They thought their chance to escape finally came.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ying's grip instantly exposed his ferocious nature... so frightened that the group of people in the picture were trembling.</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes, an old voice came out from the picture.</p>

    <p>Although his voice was trembling, it sounded like a bold one: "Who are you? Mr. Zheng... where are you?"</p>

    <p>"He imprisoned you ruthlessly in the picture. You still call him Mr. Zheng?" Wang Ying was happy.</p>

    <p>This is obviously the old "Stockholm Syndrome."</p>

    <p>To put it simply, this phenomenon is a kind of psychological dependence of the victim on the criminal...</p>

    <p>"The world in this picture was born from chaos. It sounds like you can get whatever you want. It's just that it's all false. The old people are the first ones to come in. They have already accepted the status quo."</p>

    <p>The old voice said: "But there are also some people who don't want to be in this false world."</p>

    <p>"I see. Then who are you?" Wang Ying nodded and asked.</p>

    <p>"My name is Zhang Qi, and my nickname is Zhang Zhui." The old voice replied</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the old man's life and past through King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Zhang Qi. Also called Zhang Zhui... is actually an eternal thief.</p>

    <p>He's an oddball amongst the greats of the ages.</p>

    <p>No wonder he can adapt to the dilemma of being trapped in the Corpse Map so quickly... I dare to love because I like to steal other people's things. I have been imprisoned in it many times.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wondered if people who like to steal things are put in a prison or some other place. They will feel like they are at home.</p>

    <p>So this is considered an "ancestral skill?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Then why were you suppressed?"</p>

    <p>This is actually a very embarrassing question.</p>

    <p>For those who are suppressed in the Corpse Map, almost everyone has a past that they cannot look back on...</p>

    <p>"Of course I stole Dao Ancestor Wang's things... but I returned them after using them at that time." After a moment of silence, Zhang Xi continued.</p>

    <p>"Then you were suppressed?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah... that old guy is so unreasonable!"</p>

    <p>"What did you steal?"</p>

    <p>"A lonely woman. It is said that she is also the King of the Divine Realm."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>
