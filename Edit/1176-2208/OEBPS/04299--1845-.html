  <h1>Chapter 1845 Who can keep a diary?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facing the menacing You Yueqing. Sun Rong had the illusion that she couldn't resist it for the first time. She never thought that someone could guess Wang Ling based on her own intuition. Extraordinary.</p>

    <p>This woman... is very dangerous. More dangerous than anyone she has dealt with before. She looks innocent but is far less innocent than Jiang Yingying. She is even deeper than Jiugong Liangzi in the city. And she gives people a foggy feeling. No matter how attentively one observes, one cannot see through it.</p>

    <p>While she was dazed, You Yueqing once again put on her calm look and said, "Now, this is the secret shared by my classmate Sun Rong and me. I don't want to give it to Wang Ling either. To cause trouble. So I have kept this secret very well."</p>

    <p>She didn't ask how Sun Rong realized Wang Ling's true strength. Instead, she selectively skipped this link.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that You Yueqing feels that she and Sun Rong have just met. It would be a bit rude to come to visit tonight without any notice. Therefore, she does not want to be so nosy. She asks endless questions like a curious baby.</p>

    <p>And even if she asked the question, she felt that Sun Rong would not answer her honestly. Nine times out of ten, she would find an excuse that was inconsistent with the facts.</p>

    <p>After all, she is not that familiar with Sun Rong yet.</p>

    <p>And it's obvious now. Sun Rong is somewhat wary of her.</p>

    <p>So judging from the current situation, it's not the time for her to be truly open and honest.</p>

    <p>For You Yueqing, helping to investigate the matter of the video blogger Li Xuan is not the key. The key is to use this time to get closer to Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And when that time came, it was the time for her to speak.</p>

    <p>"What does classmate Sun Rong think about the video blogger?" At this time, You Yueqing asked again.</p>

    <p>"Obviously. Wang Ling doesn't want us to get involved. It means that behind this matter, it may be very dangerous." Sun Rong said: "If we forcefully intervene in this matter, I'm afraid we will endanger Wang Ling. It's causing trouble. So... it's better not to do anything."</p>

    <p>"That's true."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing nodded and said: "But it's okay to do some logistical work. I think it's okay? For example, I recently discovered a mysterious organization. This organization seems to have something to do with Wang Ling. I think it will continue like this in the long run. It would be very dangerous... not conducive to Wang Ling hiding his strength."</p>

    <p>"What organization?"</p>

    <p>"What's it called... Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the apartment of the video blogger Li Xuan. Wang Ling's meeting with the three Royal Eternals is still going on.</p>

    <p>Meng Liuli's eyes showed an aurora color. She was working hard to read the dream invasion records of the Dream Clan's shared spiritual space.</p>

    <p>"Found it."</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, she took out a wordless jade tube from her sleeve and mapped everything she saw in her mental space onto the jade tube.</p>

    <p>"Which family's writing is it?" asked the Skeleton Prince.</p>

    <p>"It's still unclear which clan it belongs to. But now the mysterious text I mapped in the jade tube was seen in the library of Dongda Emperor's palace." Meng Liuli said.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>He had never heard of this name before, but he felt that this person seemed to be something special.</p>

    <p>The lion-headed man immediately explained to Wang Ling: "In ancient times, various tribes have been competing against each other. Some tribes with weak strength will form alliance camps in order to survive. In its heyday, it was divided into four major camps. Emperor Dongda was one of them."</p>

    <p>"What about Dao Ancestor Wang?" At this time, Wang Ying's voice came from Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>"Dao Ancestor Wang is elusive. He has no interest in joining the disputes between these Eternal Tribes, and he has no interest in leading the Eternal Ones. He only has a small chance of stepping in to mediate when there are irreconcilable conflicts among the various tribes."</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince said: "This is Dao Ancestor's overall view... Even those self-proclaimed emperors are incomparable. Of course. Being able to become the emperor at that time is naturally unquestionable in terms of strength. Several of us have also relied on them separately. Under the banner of these four great emperors, I also thought about running for the throne, but it was difficult to reach the sky."</p>

    <p>"So now it seems that these mysterious texts are most likely written by a certain emperor?" Wang Ying asked instead of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"uncertain."</p>

    <p>Meng Liuli shook her head and said: "Members of my clan once invaded the dream of the master of the Sutra Collection Pavilion in the Imperial Palace of the East. They also found this mysterious text through the dream of the master of the Sutra Collection Pavilion in the Imperial Palace. The information is very complicated. Therefore, the mysterious text may not necessarily have been written by Emperor Dongda. However, it is obvious that Emperor Dongda has deciphered the mysterious text. He also used the mysterious text to write a diary."</p>

    <p>"Write a diary?" Wang Ling, Wang Ying, the Skeleton Prince and the lion-headed man all looked puzzled.</p>

    <p>"The first half of the jade cylinder contains records of various mysterious texts in the Sutra Pavilion. The content of the second half of the volume was written by Emperor Dongda. The timeline of the content is later than that of the first half of the volume. So I suspect that Emperor Dongda deciphered the mysterious texts. It was written later." Meng Liuli said.</p>

    <p>A great emperor writes a diary using the mysterious script he just learned. What is this operation?</p>

    <p>"So the emperor also writes a diary?"</p>

    <p>When the lion-headed man thought of this, he couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>"Yes. No serious person would write a diary." The Skeleton Prince also nodded and said.</p>

    <p>Having said this, the Skeleton Prince paused and asked: "Lion, do you keep a diary?"</p>

    <p>Lion-Headed Man: "Don't write. What about you. Skeleton?"</p>

    <p>Skeleton Prince: "How can anyone write the truth in a diary? Can it be called the truth if it is written in a diary?"</p>

    <p>The two of them burst into laughter when they said this. They shouted "vile" in unison.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling had a completely different view on Emperor Dongda's behavior of writing a diary in mysterious script.</p>

    <p>This clever Eastern Emperor deciphered the mysterious text and wrote a diary in the mysterious text. He must be very confident in the confidentiality of the mysterious text. Even did not believe that anyone would decipher the mysterious text at all.</p>

    <p>So, use reverse thinking and logic to think about it. What the Eastern Emperor wrote in his diary may actually be true... it may involve a series of eternal secrets.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that after Meng Liuli retrieved it, he could quickly find out who in the Eternal Tribe was using this mysterious text.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Meng Liuli directly searched for the diary of the Eastern Emperor.</p>

    <p>So now there seems to be only one way to crack this by Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>That is to use pupil power to forcibly decode the mysterious text, thereby translating the mysterious text into a language that is closest to modern writing.</p>

    <p>However, these mysterious texts are extremely obscure. Wang Ling is worried that his pupils may be subjected to unprecedented high-intensity pressure during the process of deciphering. If the King's Eyes is damaged, it will not be good.</p>

    <p>So for the sake of caution. In order to prevent this from happening. Wang Ling has already thought of a way...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, he raised his palm to the ground and immediately summoned a glass display cabinet.</p>

    <p>And what is sealed inside is actually a variety of pupils...</p>

    <p>At this point, the Skeleton Prince, Meng Liuli, the Lion-headed Man, and Wang Ying were all stunned.</p>

    <p>They daw Wang Ling taking off his King's Eyes pupils with ease. He kept the King's Eyes in a glass display cabinet like replacing contact lenses. Then he took out a new pair of pupils and installed them back into his eye sockets.</p>
