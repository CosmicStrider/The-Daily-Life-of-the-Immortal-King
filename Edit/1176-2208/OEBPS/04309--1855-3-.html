  <h1>Chapter 1855 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a state of confusion, Sun Rong woke up. Her consciousness was clear. She still remembered what had just happened.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>In order to save people, a group of them connected with Zhang Zhui's body like the gourd baby saving his grandfather.</p>

    <p>Then in the blink of an eye, her body began to twitch as if she had been electrocuted. Under the influence of a mysterious force, her soul was squeezed out of her body and sucked into a vortex full of mystery.</p>

    <p>At this time. After Sun Rong woke up, she felt that her body was covered with bandages. She was lying in a place full of light.</p>

    <p>Infinite light shines in from the huge floor-to-ceiling windows all around and falls on the bedside. The vermilion gauze curtain moves with the wind. There is a Suzaku mark tattooed on it.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately realized that they had entered an unknown area. Just like what monk Jin Deng said at the beginning. He was afraid that they fell into the world outlined in the mysterious text together...</p>

    <p>"What should I do?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stood up. Then she soon realized that this body was not hers.</p>

    <p>Because she could clearly feel that her chest seemed to be a lot heavier. This was not what she should have at her age.</p>

    <p>So even if she didn't look in the mirror, Sun Rong clearly knows that her current self is not her true self.</p>

    <p>Only the soul is her own.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er...Ying'er...are you there?"</p>

    <p>The strong sense of strangeness made Sun Rong feel slightly uncomfortable. She tried to call Sun Ying'er. However, she found that Sun Ying'er did not respond at all.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this body doesn't belong to her, so the shadow doesn't belong to her either? So she can't resonate with Sun Ying'er?</p>

    <p>In other words, in fact, Sun Ying'er also entered this world constructed by mysterious literature and played a certain role?</p>

    <p>For a moment. Sun Rong was a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she could feel that the resonance between herself and Aohai was still there. It was on standby.</p>

    <p>As long as Sun Rong is willing, Aohai can still be summoned to defend herself at any time.</p>

    <p>But now Sun Rong does not dare to act rashly.</p>

    <p>"If the world here is like what those seniors said, it is the past world outlined by the Eternal One."</p>

    <p>"Then everything I do here that goes against the historical trajectory may change the future."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong closed her eyes. Lied on the bed. Calmed down her thoughts. Analyzed the situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>The top priority. She needs to know who her role is in this world.</p>

    <p>"You're awake. Stop pretending. The emperor spared your life, but that doesn't mean the rest of us have forgiven you." At this time, a magnetic young voice came from the side.</p>

    <p>Ye Ren, the white-robed steward next to Emperor Dongda, walked slowly from the side door. His steps were very soft and his clothes were a little messy. He had obviously just finished handling some important matters, and then came here again covered in dust.</p>

    <p>"Where is the emperor?" Sun Rong asked. This was just following the conversation. Mainly because she wanted to find out her identity.</p>

    <p>"Jiao Yang. You are not qualified to take the initiative to see the emperor." Ye Ren said seriously.</p>

    <p>Jiao Yang?</p>

    <p>So, is this her name?</p>

    <p>And judging from the current situation, Sun Rong feels that this arrogant man must have made some mistake. Otherwise, she would not have been beaten like this.</p>

    <p>The most likely outcome is a fight with the emperor that the white-robed manager calls her. Then at the critical moment of life and death, the man called the emperor lets Jiao Yang live.</p>

    <p>After waking up, she entered the body of the lady named "Jiao Yang."</p>

    <p>But entering the body is obviously not the key.</p>

    <p>The key question now is. How should she return to the original real world...</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I don't remember anything."</p>

    <p>Helpless. Sun Rong can only pretend to be a snake, if she doesn't it will give people clues.</p>

    <p>So amnesia is always a very valid excuse</p>

    <p>Since it's amnesia, it wouldn't be too strange if her behavior is different from before.</p>

    <p>"You have committed a heinous crime. Do you want to cover it all up with a sentence of amnesia?"</p>

    <p>Ye Ren smiled. He put his hands behind his back and stared at her: "You should be able to move now, right? Get up. Follow me to a place. The emperor wants to see you later."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has no choice but to obey. After all, she cannot do anything that goes against the historical trajectory now.</p>

    <p>At this time, her body was wrapped in layers of bandages, like a walking mummy. Ye Ren threw a burqa to her. After putting on the burqa, she became even more indistinguishable.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Rong slightly startled.</p>

    <p>She glanced at Ye Ren dully: "Senior, what I committed was a capital crime?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. I can actually become your predecessor to the Sun Goddess. It seems like you really don't remember anything."</p>

    <p>Ye Ren's eyes showed a meaningful smile: "In the past, you were so arrogant. You would never be so polite to others. Jiao Yang. Compared with you now, I appreciate your unruly appearance more."</p>

    <p>"You haven't answered my question yet." Sun Rong said seriously.</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Ye Ren nodded slightly and looked at her: "Since you don't remember anything, I'll tell you. You colluded with the Western Emperor and led a group of Western royal families to try to rebel. If the account is settled, you will die thousands of times. Ten thousand times."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Ye Ren led Sun Rong through the long palace corridor. All the guards here had been removed. Sun Rong saw a mess all around. There were broken walls and rubble everywhere. Obviously these are the traces left after the battle just now.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the decoration style of the room just now was quite modern. Now when we walk to the outside, it is actually an ancient palace-style building. This makes Sun Rong even more surprised by this mysterious world.</p>

    <p>Since this mysterious text was written by the Eternal One, Sun Rong deduced from this that she might be trapped in the world where the Eternal One was.</p>

    <p>While leading Sun Rong. Ye Ren said: "I am the only one who knows the emperor's final choice to spare your life. I hope you will not make any more disobedient actions. Otherwise, even Dao Ancestor Wang will not be able to save you."</p>

    <p>"You have also seen the emperor's supreme light, Kongque Mingwang. It is an invincible existence..."</p>

    <p>"So I'm dead in the eyes of others?"</p>

    <p>"You were burned to ashes by the light of Kongque Mingwang. This scene was seen by everyone in the Eastern Region. Otherwise, the common people would be angry." Ye Ren said.</p>

    <p>After walking in tandem for about ten minutes, the two finally arrived in front of a locked palace. This was already a relatively well-preserved building in the Eastern Emperor's Palace after the war.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought Ye Ren would go directly to the door and unlock it. Unexpectedly, the other party did not take out the key. Instead, he directly grabbed the spiritual lock of the palace and began to study it.</p>

    <p>Finally, he slowly took out a piece of wire from his sleeve...</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>The other party is obviously a member of the emperor. Why do you need to use wire to pick the lock when opening your own palace?</p>

    <p>Almost at that moment, Sun Rong suddenly realized it.</p>

    <p>She stared at Ye Ren's back and asked tentatively: "Um... are you Senior Xiang Yi or Senior Zhang Zhui?"</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Ye Ren's back was obviously startled.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he turned back to look at Sun Rong with a horrified look on his face: "I'm Zhang Zhui. Could it be that you are... the Sun Rong girl?"</p>
