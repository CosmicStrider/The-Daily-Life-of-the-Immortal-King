  <h1>Chapter 1941 Teng Luchen's secret weapon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The wall panel hidden behind the tea rack in Jiutian Tea House is covered with dense memory notes. These are the information that Teng Luchen has collected over the years.</p>

    <p>He was worried that his memory would be erased by physics or magic. Therefore, he left this secret wall panel as evidence of linking clues.</p>

    <p>Of course, the wallboard also collected some information on other young geniuses that he was interested in... but that was all for backup.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen knew very well. The spell that accurately erases memories will only erase a part of specific memories. If the people from the Office of Strategic Deception erased the memory about Wang Ling, he would probably forget the existence of a wall.</p>

    <p>So he also collected the information of other students at the same time. In this case, he would have forgotten the information of Wang Ling. Then the existence of the wall would still be in his mind.</p>

    <p>As long as he opens this wall again, he will definitely see something about Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This is a seamless plan.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is still a flawless trap. If everything goes as he expected, whenever the Office of Strategic Deception makes a wrong move, he will have ironclad evidence of Wang Ling's true combat effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to better implement this plan, Teng Luchen has actually set up his own spies in Number 60 High School to provide himself with intelligence information.</p>

    <p>Less than half an hour after Jing Heqiu left, there was another dull knock on the door of Jiutian Teahouse.</p>

    <p>A nice girl's voice sounded from the door of the teahouse: "Is Mr. Teng here?"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen reacted quickly. He quickly reset the mechanism. Then he unbolted the door and let the person in.</p>

    <p>Because it was not long before morning. The girl in front of him was wearing the uniform of Number 60 High School. She had a well-behaved look on her face. No matter how many times he looked at her, she would still have a similar feeling to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Yingying, come on quickly."</p>

    <p>Seeing Jiang Yingying come to the door, Teng Luchen immediately showed his harmless smile. His kind-hearted look was like the warm old man in the community. It gave people an unimaginable sense of closeness.</p>

    <p>He took the initiative to make a cup of tea and handed it to Jiang Yingying: "Here, let's have a cup of tea to refresh ourselves. You're going to class soon."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Mr. Teng. How are you, Mr. Teng? Did you gain anything?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying took it politely with both hands. Then she took a sip and asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"Not yet. But there will be a conclusion soon." Teng Tianyuan laughed. He shook his bamboo fan with one hand and looked at Jiang Yingying: "I also want to ask you. How is your situation?"</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High School is actually not going well here. I feel like everyone is on guard against me. Maybe it's because I just came here not long ago. I'm not very familiar with everyone... Photos I sent to Teng Lao by express delivery a few times ago. And I took all the photos secretly!" Jiang Yingying said disappointedly.</p>

    <p>"You shouldn't. Yingying, you are so beautiful. How can you not make friends?" Teng Luchen showed a puzzled expression.</p>

    <p>"It's not that I don't have friends. It's just that I feel like I can't go any further. So I've been practicing hard lately."</p>

    <p>"You are the granddaughter of Martial Saint. With his teaching talent, you must be good. As long as you work harder, it will definitely not be a problem to get ahead in the future."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen consoled him: "What's the progress at the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"I was just about to talk to Mr. Teng! The Office of Strategic Deception is making great progress! And I have a senior elder named Wang Piaoliang as my master! As long as I practice diligently, I should be able to know a lot of things. It's just..." Jiang Yingying said excitedly.</p>

    <p>"Just what?"</p>

    <p>"It's just that I noticed that my master seems to be more concerned about love issues. Doesn't it mean that the higher the cultivation level, the less desire? The situation seems to be completely different from what I thought."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teng Luchen couldn't help coughing a few times: "Everyone's situation is different. In fact, there are very few people who have no desires and no demands. And most of them have to maintain a virgin body because of the restrictions on their skills. If a monk wants to continue her Taoist tradition, she should find a suitable male monk to get married and have children. In fact, it is a normal thing. The male monk should marry the female monk. It is also normal..."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen gave an analysis.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was chewing on the name Wang Piaoliang.</p>

    <p>He remembered that when the Office of Strategic Deception was founded, there was no such elder on their official website. In other words, this elder had only recently joined the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>She has just joined the Office of Strategic Deception and already holds the position of an elder. This person's identity is definitely not simple. And there is a high probability that she can have direct contact with the senior management of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Teng Luchen couldn't help but feel happy again. His choice of Jiang Yingying as an undercover agent at Number 60 High School was indeed the right one.</p>

    <p>At least this girl is quite lucky. She immediately managed to win over an elder who may have close contact with the senior officials of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"Since you have already worshiped Elder Wang as your master, then just follow her and practice well. There is no need to rush the matter of intelligence. Doing so will reveal your flaws. Just let nature take its course." Teng Luchen smiled.</p>

    <p>"I understand. Mr. Teng." Jiang Yingying nodded.</p>

    <p>"Right. This is for you."</p>

    <p>As he said that, Teng Luchen took out a small can of tea from the tea shelf and handed it to Jiang Yingying: "There are six tea cans in this box. You can keep them to make tea for drinking. They cleanse the marrow and purify the spiritual roots. Of course, if money is tight, it can be sold. It can be fetched at a good price in the tea market. Don't listen to the tricks of tea bosses. This tea can is worth at least 100,000 immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"One hundred thousand... immortal gold?" Jiang Yingying was shocked. Her hands were shaking: "No. Teng Lao. This is too precious..."</p>

    <p>Although Teng Tianyuan did promise her that if she could collect some useful information for Jingmi Institute, she could earn some pocket money. But obviously, the amount of "pocket money" was far more than Jiang Yingying thought.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Jiang Yingying feels that she didn't actually do anything. She just took a few photos of Wang Ling. Sun Rong is too guarded against her. And it seems that even Jiugong Liangzi has been with her recently. Sun Rong has formed a united front.</p>

    <p>When two female bosses join forces, she really can't get a pin in here.</p>

    <p>"Take it. You deserve it."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen smiled: "I don't have much else here. Just these tea leaves. I also know that your old man is used to being thrifty. He won't give you much pocket money. But cultivation is a waste of money." The job of our Jingmi Institute is to discover talents and pool resources to cultivate them. Yingying, you are my chosen one. So it is very reasonable for me to give you some resources."</p>

    <p>"But this..."</p>

    <p>"No, but Yingying. Take it. You did a good job. Just remember to keep in touch with me from time to time."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen had a firm attitude.</p>

    <p>After all, the chess piece Jiang Yingying is his secret weapon...</p>
