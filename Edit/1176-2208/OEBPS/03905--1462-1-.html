  <h1>Chapter 1462 A surprising glimpse of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Outside Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. Inside a black off-road vehicle.</p>

    <p>A man in black with the Jiugong family's iconic purple-eyed crow family emblem is using binoculars to observe Jiugong Liangzi who followed Zhuo Yi into the ancient street.</p>

    <p>"Command. Entry has been confirmed."</p>

    <p>Then, the man in black put down the telescope and responded to the micro transmitter on his chest.</p>

    <p>At the same time, far away in the huge Jiugong family mansion on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>In a courtyard as large as an ancient palace, a young man with a lower limb disability was pushing a wheelchair to enjoy the cherry blossom garden.</p>

    <p>Cherry blossom petals with a delicate fragrance fell from the surrounding cherry blossom trees. They fell on the young man's sleeves and thighs.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was slightly sad.</p>

    <p>Complex emotions linger in my heart.</p>

    <p>Even under such beautiful scenery, I still can't completely calm down.</p>

    <p>Behind him was always a middle-aged man wearing warrior armor. The man was Duyan. He looked fierce and sinister, making people afraid to approach him.</p>

    <p>This is the exclusive guard assigned by the Jiugong family to the young man. He is responsible for protecting the young man's safety. At the same time, he will also handle some things for the young man.</p>

    <p>The young man's legs and feet are inconvenient, so Duyan needs to complete many tasks for him.</p>

    <p>"I do this. I'm still so sorry for Liangzi..." Jiugong Xiushi frowned.</p>

    <p>"Those who achieve great things must make sacrifices. Maybe this is cruel to Miss Liangzi. But if she is here...the young master with disabled legs will never be able to inherit the throne."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai muttered: "Besides, Miss Liangzi and you are only half-brothers. Miss Liangzi is the eldest daughter of the second wife. You are the son of the eldest wife."</p>

    <p>"But she is still my sister." Jiugong Xiushi was still struggling.</p>

    <p>"Plan big things. Necessary sacrifices are inevitable."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said in a cold voice: "Besides, Master Xiushi regrets it now. It's too late. If you didn't decide to fight for the headship of the Jiugong family from the beginning, then you wouldn't accept my proposal..."</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about my hypocrisy?" Jiugong Xiushi turned his face and looked at him.</p>

    <p>"No. I didn't say that."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai's expression didn't show any abnormality. He just rolled his eyes inwardly.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi's mother-in-law called him early in the morning and wandered around the cherry blossom garden for a long time.</p>

    <p>For Duyan, he, a straight man, came to watch the cherry blossoms with a man. It was really disgusting...</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that Jiugong Xiushi was the only son of the eldest lady, and the eldest lady's entrustment to him during her lifetime.</p>

    <p>He had already broken Jiugong Xiushi's third leg.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi's "hypocrisy" is not fake at all.</p>

    <p>But out of repayment to the eldest lady, no matter how hypocritical the young man in front of him was, Duyan could only endure it.</p>

    <p>It's all about planning.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Xiushi heard the voice from the transmitter.</p>

    <p>He looked at Duyan: "It seems. Everything is going well. Liangzi has already gone in."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Miss Liangzi has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to act alone. She will never miss it this time." One-Eyed Samurai said.</p>

    <p>"Is it really possible to unblock {Ghost Book}?"</p>

    <p>"It is impossible to completely unblock the main account. You can only take action on a certain page or a few pages."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said: "We have already investigated several ghosts commonly used by Miss Liangzi. We only need to tear up the part of the main book separately. These ghosts will be released. And the copy in Miss Liangzi's hand Engraved {Ghost Book}. It is the escape hatch for these ghosts who have released their seals."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling and Sun Rong came out of the bushes, they actually sensed the auras of Chen Chao and the others.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>These three people lied before. There was no accident at all on the subway.</p>

    <p>However, considering that he and Sun Rong teleported here, the two of them had a very tacit understanding and did not walk over immediately.</p>

    <p>It takes half an hour to get here from the entrance of 60 High School. At the fastest speed, it takes half an hour.</p>

    <p>If they went out now, it would be hard to explain why they were so fast.</p>

    <p>The two chose a bench on the west side to sit down.</p>

    <p>From this angle, Chen Chao and the others couldn't detect them at all. "We'll go there in half an hour..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling responded.</p>

    <p>He looked at the girl's test with his peripheral vision, then sat down.</p>

    <p>In fact, the reason why we can't go there now is not only because of the time problem caused by "teleportation."</p>

    <p>Another very important point is that the girl's blush has not calmed down yet...</p>

    <p>After all, the middle-aged woman's speech just now was really shocking.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because Sun Ying'er has been driving. Girls who were not very familiar with these things have become particularly sensitive now.</p>

    <p>Woohoo!</p>

    <p>It's all Ying'er's fault!</p>

    <p>It makes her even unclean...</p>

    <p>Half an hour seemed like an extremely long time, but it also seemed extremely short.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling closed his eyes slightly. He was as quiet as a sculpture. As if he was asleep.</p>

    <p>A fallen leaf fell on Wang Ling's head.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong reached out and tried to pluck off the leaf. However, Wang Ling got up first and shook off the leaf.</p>

    <p>It's been half an hour. Time's up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was just counting with his eyes closed.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to waste a second.</p>

    <p>Because now the crispy noodles flagship store in the ancient street has opened. From a distance, he could smell the aroma of pepper noodles in the plastic bag.</p>

    <p>"eh..."Sun Rong retracted his hand with a little regret.</p>

    <p>It was clearly an opportunity very close to Wang Ling just now.</p>

    <p>The girl found that when she was alone, she was not as brave as she thought.</p>

    <p>Maybe she should be a little bolder.</p>

    <p>Just like Master of Shadows. Just hit the wall...</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling walking towards Chen Chao and the others. Sun Rong suddenly came to his senses. He quickly followed behind and chased after me: "Classmate Wang Ling...wait for me..."</p>

    <p>Hearing the girl's voice, Wang Ling paused in his steps. He turned slightly sideways and glanced at the girl behind him.</p>

    <p>This is a stunning glimpse.</p>

    <p>The moment he turned around.</p>

    <p>A gust of wind lifted the boy's collar.</p>

    <p>With the hair dancing in the wind, looking at it from the perspective of a girl, the overflowing sense of youth can no longer be described in words.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Ying'er, who had been silent for a long time, also screamed loudly in Sun Rong's mind.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: Ahhh! Ling Zhenren! That's awesome! I don't know how many times better than that bastard Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>This shout can be said to be a breakthrough in one second. It instantly brought back all the girl's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that the temperature of his face, which had just calmed down, began to rise again.</p>

    <p>In the distance, Guo Hao and others saw Wang Ling and Sun Rong walking in their direction. They waved hello from a distance.</p>

    <p>To be honest, they thought they would have to wait another half hour.</p>

    <p>"How did you get here? It was too fast..." Guo Hao was in disbelief.</p>

    <p>"Half an hour. It's really fast. It's not teleporting, right?" Chen Chao agreed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly explained: "We took a taxi...Okay! None of this is important! Everyone has been waiting for a long time. Just hurry in!"</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Wang Ling was directly grabbed by Chen Chao and Guo Hao. The three of them walked shoulder to shoulder toward the entrance together. They looked like they were in a good relationship.</p>

    <p>"Man. That's it." Li Youyue sighed.</p>

    <p>"Their relationship is really good..." To be honest. Sun Rong looked at the scene in front of him with some envy.</p>

    <p>Just now. In half an hour, she didn't even have the courage to stretch out her hand...</p>

    <p>As a result, Chen Chao and Guo Hao hooked up so easily.</p>

    <p>"Are you jealous?" Li Youyue suddenly felt funny.</p>

    <p>"No!" Sun Rong retorted.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I'll just pretend it's okay. You are the boss. You have the final say."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue smiled meaningfully: "Let's go together. Don't be thrown away by the three of them."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded: "Yeah!"</p>

    <p>Then, the two girls followed behind, arm in arm.</p>

    <p>At the front. Among the three people holding each other's backs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is caught in the middle and is being questioned...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao chuckled: "Tell me the truth about Wang Ling! What did you do to Sun Rong on the road!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao echoed: "Yes! You must tell the truth! I saw that Sun Rong's face was red just now... You couldn't be in the car. Your hands and feet are not clean..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just after Wang Ling the five people successfully passed the entrance of the ancient street.</p>

    <p>An ancient street cleaning staff who covered himself tightly took off his mask and hat.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling...Sun Rong...on the car?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying probably heard these terms when he was just pretending to be a cleaning staff.</p>

    <p>At this time, she was staring in the direction of Wang Ling the five people. The hand holding the broom was trembling slightly.</p>
