  <h1>Chapter 1869 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The chaos in the scene only lasted for a moment and soon calmed down. The Immortal Stone was stolen by Zhang Zhui, a young man from the Eternal Era. And as soon as he got it, he withdrew without leaving a single cloud behind.</p>

    <p>In a daze, old Zhang Zhui suddenly recalled this legendary experience that spanned eternity.</p>

    <p>At that time, he did receive help from a senior.</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhang Zhui didn't expect that the senior who made him successful would be himself.</p>

    <p>"Zhang Zhui! Don't let me catch you!" King Tiankun slapped him hard, breaking the armrest of the chair.</p>

    <p>He was furious. He never expected that Zhang Zhui would succeed despite his tricks.</p>

    <p>This was a slap in the face.</p>

    <p>And hitting him in the face was actually hitting Emperor Xi in the face...</p>

    <p>This shameless god damn thief!</p>

    <p>When the immortal stone was stolen, the transaction of this mythical beast hair came to a deadlock.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun is certainly very shameless. But the Central Auction House also has an unshirkable responsibility.</p>

    <p>After all, the people escorting the treasure transaction were sent by the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>One party is the mysterious and generous guest in Room 1. The other party is King Tiankun, the representative of the Chinese and Western Emperors who sits firmly in Room 9.</p>

    <p>Neither the Central Auction House dared to offend the people on either side. So in the end, after the administrator Chen Yanan asked for instructions.</p>

    <p>The president's son, Liu Renwen, the auctioneer of the auction, stepped forward to smooth things over.</p>

    <p>"This is a major mistake made by our house. King Tiankun, please rest assured. Since you have taken the hair of the mythical beast, it will count. As for the immortal stone, our bank will be responsible for using other treasures to offset it. It will definitely satisfy you. It will also satisfy the distinguished guest in Room 1." Liu Renwen said respectfully.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter to me. I just want that mythical beast hair. As for what you do, I have nothing to do with it." King Tiankun snorted. His immortal stone was blatantly stolen by Zhang Zhui. He was always holding his breath.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Liu Renwen comforted Queen Tiankun and soon came to Room 1 with Chen Yanan.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, I'm sorry. This was my bank's mistake... which led to an accident during this transaction. It also shocked you." The two of them bowed their hands.</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan's face was covered with clouds. The sadness shown was painful.</p>

    <p>However, when she raised her head, she accidentally saw the group of people in front of her looking at her with a smile.</p>

    <p>She was stunned.</p>

    <p>She was even more curious about the origins of the guests in Room 1.</p>

    <p>This must be someone who has seen a lot of the world. He is not a child of a famous family, but he must at least be a member of the royal family.</p>

    <p>This is too calm!</p>

    <p>Not only was he calm, but he actually looked at her with a smile.</p>

    <p>How big is this heart...</p>

    <p>This made Chen Yanan not able to help but respect Wang Ling and others even more. She didn't dare to neglect them at all.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry for frightening all the seniors. We have issued an Eternal Sea capture notice. Zhang Zhui is wanted throughout the universe. I will definitely give him this bad breath."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan said: "As for the previous transaction, although the 30 million Immortal Stones are still there, the mixed Immortal Stone is now missing... I wonder if we can compensate in other ways? King Tiankun is determined to get that divine beast hair."</p>

    <p>"That's easy to say."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda nodded and smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying passed Wang Ling's instructions in his body and commanded him.</p>

    <p>To King Tiankun, this is a priceless hair of a mythical beast. But to Wang Ling, it is just his own hair...</p>

    <p>In his eyes, this was not that valuable in the first place.</p>

    <p>As for the Immortal Stone, it was originally an object in the Eastern Palace.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda has collected this stone for a long time. He has long been tired of looking at it. Even if it is lost, he will not feel bad.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, now through this transaction, he can get some new things to play with.</p>

    <p>For Emperor Dongda, such a deal is a dream come true.</p>

    <p>"The estimated value of that Immortal Stone is about 30 million Immortal Stones. What do you want to exchange for it?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "My elders are interested in the skull of the mythical beast with a long name."</p>

    <p>"That's easy to say." Liu Renwen said directly: "I have the final say on this sacred beast skull. I will give it to this lord. As for the remaining 30 million shortfall, we will calculate it separately."</p>

    <p>"There are two options now. One is that our bank will directly convert 30 million mixed spirit stones to compensate you."</p>

    <p>"The second option is to do it in the next auction. If you like something, you can choose anything as compensation. No matter what the final price is, it will be borne by our bank."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda waved his hand and made a choice directly without thinking: "Then let's go to option two."</p>

    <p>"That's very good."</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen and Chen Yanan bowed one after another and quickly retreated.</p>

    <p>To Emperor Dongda himself, the Hunling Stone was just trivial money. Besides, Zhang Zhui had gotten a lot of money from him before. They didn't lack these things at all.</p>

    <p>It would be too fun to ask for money directly.</p>

    <p>He knew that King Tiankun also had something he must get at this auction. And with the promise provided by the buying house, he could boldly compete with King Tiankun without any effort.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun had previously tried to humiliate him by auctioning off the Immortal Stone snatched from his Eastern Region Imperial Palace. As the emperor of a region, he should have wanted to get it back.</p>

    <p>Soon, order was restored to the scene.</p>

    <p>The storm calmed down quickly. Guests on both sides were very satisfied with the outcome. There really is nothing better than this.</p>

    <p>No matter whether it is Room 1 where Wang Ling lives or Room 9 of King Tiankun, they are all characters that are not easy to mess with for the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>Unless the president personally suppresses the situation, it will be impossible to suppress it.</p>

    <p>As the president's own son, Liu Renwen rarely presides over such a grand auction in the context of the gathering of the Four Emperors.</p>

    <p>One thing to say. He was a little panicked.</p>

    <p>Although he has inherited the memory of "Liu Renwen" and just follow the step-by-step operation based on experience, he is still worried that an accident will happen.</p>

    <p>So he can only act on intuition.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his "luck" has always been very good.</p>

    <p>Although there was an accident just now, it was handled very well.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that it was precisely because of the accident that he figured out who the guest in Room 1 was.</p>

    <p>He deliberately created a flaw so that the Immortal Stone could be stolen by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>The purpose is to go upstairs in person and have direct contact with the guests in Room 1.</p>

    <p>And with the intuition of the only koi in the world of cultivation, "Qin Zhong" who now plays "Liu Renwen" has already made the most basic judgment about Room 1.</p>

    <p>The people in Room 1 are all our own people who have traveled from modern times.</p>

    <p>And Li Ren. It must be Zhang Zhui!</p>

    <p>It's just that Qin Zhong hasn't thought about who Wang Ling plays.</p>

    <p>"We can only take one step at a time." He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Then he motioned with his eyes to Chen Yanan to take out the next auction item.</p>

    <p>That's a giant futon.</p>

    <p>According to the data, it was something used by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>
