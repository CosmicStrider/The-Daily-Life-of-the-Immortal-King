  <h1>Chapter 2152 Director Wang's performance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The critical moment. Wang Ling appeared instantly. The leader of Fuyun Town and a city lord-level figure suddenly attracted everyone's attention.</p>

    <p>Many people focused their attention on it. They saw that the nickname displayed above Wang Ling was indeed different from that of ordinary players. It read [General Fuyun Town]. Even the font color was consistent with the NPC.</p>

    <p>This is the benefit of having multiple identities. If Wang Ling wants to, he can also change his nickname display to [Floating Cloud Town Baidong Demon Lord].</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling doesn't take the initiative to expose himself, no one will ever know his true identity for so long.</p>

    <p>Even though Sun Rong, Lao Huang had long suspected him. However, there was no evidence at all to prove that Wang Ling was a real person and not just an NPC in the game.</p>

    <p>The two of them have tested Wang Ling many times. Their attitude has changed from being stubborn at the beginning to being calm now. Just like Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>They passed the Turing test. They asked Wang Ling hundreds of questions. As a result, Wang Ling had a specific answer to each question. And even if they messed up the order, they asked again. Wang Ling's answer Still nothing wrong.</p>

    <p>This is outrageous!</p>

    <p>Originally, Sun Rong's defense was so high that it looked like a city wall in the eyes of everyone. The high-defense heavy-armored monk with 5000 drops of blood was considered a rare species. It was a rare creature like a panda.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>They have never heard of an "NPC" with 100 million drops of blood.</p>

    <p>Wipe!</p>

    <p>How can there be an NPC with 100 million drops of blood! Even the boss Hei Long in Hei Long's cave only has 5 million drops of blood!</p>

    <p>Is a creature with 100 million blood real?</p>

    <p>Many people saw Wang Ling appear. There was an expression of disbelief on their faces. They never thought that in the game world of Itinerant Immortal, there was actually a level 1... strange creature with 100 million health.</p>

    <p>Can this really exist in the game world?</p>

    <p>Many people were confused.</p>

    <p>The scene immediately fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Li Bai and Mangshan fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Even Xiong Wu, who was so arrogant before, became silent.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xiongwu felt that the voice he just spoke seemed to be a little louder...</p>

    <p>He shouldn't be so arrogant...</p>

    <p>But the current atmosphere has already reached this point. It would not be a heroic style to back down at this moment.</p>

    <p>You must know that the members of the Four Elephants who are following Xiongwu at this moment are all the core players of Sword Immortal. Which one of them is not an elite of Sword Immortal taught by him personally?</p>

    <p>Now, although the "NPC" standing in front of me has enough health to scare people, it is only level 1 after all!</p>

    <p>Xiongwu secretly told himself in his heart: There is nothing to be afraid of!</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal magic ring. But it has the strongest checks and balances mechanism. Although an NPC like this has high health, its defense must be very low! He may lose hundreds of thousands of health with just one strike of his sword!</p>

    <p>But what Xiongwu didn't expect was that he was right in thinking so. Wang Ling, who has 100 million drops of blood, had the same idea.</p>

    <p>He was thinking about how many drops of blood Xiongwu's sword would cut off him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling possesses two god-level techniques. One is {Heavenly God Descends to Earth}, which is mainly used to stack up the blood volume. The other is {{Heaven Changes Fate}. This is specially used to overcome level differences and skip levels. Passive ability to counter-kill.</p>

    <p>In the map in front of him, the four elephants were approaching fiercely. Xiong Wu alone was 64 levels ahead of him, plus the other players.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling has already obtained thousands of attribute points just by using the god-level technique of {Going Against Heaven and Changing Fate} to reverse the level difference.</p>

    <p>In other words, his comprehensive attribute value is several times higher than Sun Rong. The defensive power is not the city wall. It is the 24k titanium alloy dragon iron skin!</p>

    <p>"I don't care who you are. If you stop our Four Elephants, you will be dead!" Xiong Wu held a big sword. He was angry at the arrival of Wang Ling. At the same time, there was an unknown fear in his heart. After all, a creature with 100 million blood He hasn't seen him since he started playing the game. It's really outrageous.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling acted very blandly. He didn't take Xiong Wu's words seriously at all.</p>

    <p>He raised his sword fingers together and used spiritual energy to transform the sword in front of him. He directly cut a deep ravine. It was burning with golden fire. The hot flames shocked everyone.</p>

    <p>This is another immortal method that no one has ever seen...</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was meditating in the General's Mansion, he also mastered countless spells by trying to figure out Bai Qiao's programming thinking. Now open the skill tree of Wang Ling. The number of skills on the tree is so dazzling. And all of them are orange.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the current Wang Ling is a complete bug even in the game world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>"You are looking for death!" Xiongwu stepped forward. He finally couldn't bear it any longer. He held a big sword and struck at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that the gully cut by Wang Ling was a warning, telling them not to cross the pond. Otherwise, they would bear the consequences.</p>

    <p>But just like Xiong Wu knew.</p>

    <p>The current atmosphere has reached this point. He can no longer back down. Otherwise, the reputation he has finally accumulated will be directly destroyed and become the laughing stock of everyone here.</p>

    <p>Soon he moved. After getting off his mount, Xiongwu held a big sword. His seemingly bulky body was actually extremely fast. Xiongwu was the founder of the violent sword immortal. He was also the first general in the Itinerant Immortal game world. A player with a two-handed sword whose attack speed is above 5.0.</p>

    <p>It is difficult for ordinary greatsword players to increase their attack speed!</p>

    <p>But Xiongwu relies solely on equipment and various equipment enchantments to improve his attributes to the extreme!</p>

    <p>Five swords per second can actually be achieved by a violent sword player. This makes many people feel incredible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood motionless. He was still wearing the general mask of General Fuyun Town. His whole body was covered with light armor.</p>

    <p>Just as Xiongwu approached, countless golden swords appeared behind Xiongwu. At that moment, every player on the scene could clearly feel the pressure brought by Xiongwu.</p>

    <p>"Sword! Come!"</p>

    <p>He roared. For a moment, the big sword in his hand, accompanied by the shadow behind him, turned into thousands of sword lights and struck simultaneously.</p>

    <p>"Incarnate into thousands of thunders... This is the trick that Xiongwu uses against that Hei Long..."</p>

    <p>Both Li Bai and Mangshan played several dungeons with Xiongwu. They were both shocked by Xiongwu's decision.</p>

    <p>He actually used all the tricks to deal with the last Hei Long in the most difficult dungeon. www.uukanshu.net used it directly against an outsider NPC...</p>

    <p>When this move hit Hei Long, it was a critical hit with at least hundreds of thousands of blood!</p>

    <p>Then Xiongwu needs to cool down for a long time before using it a second time. This is a big move that cannot be used continuously in a short period of time. It is one of the few unique skills that Xiongwu can master.</p>

    <p>Li Bai and Mang Shan have the same view. After all, this general from Fuyun Town is only level 1...</p>

    <p>Although there is a lot of health, the defense may be very impressive. This powerful move has been used. Hei Long's damage is hundreds of thousands. So it must be at least millions of damage to Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>The result was very fast. The value that popped up was beyond everyone's expectation...</p>

    <p>Xiongwu's damage to Wang Ling is...</p>

    <p>Miss...</p>

    <p>7017k</p>
