  <h1>Chapter 2149 Tian Ke 4 Xiang Zhong Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: There are many players in this world. Those who can have their own names among the vast number of players are rare. Li Bai and Mangshan are two special cases.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the rankings of the White Horse Guild and the Yamano Murakuo Guild, both of them have very famous names. Guilds like this that are established with the same profession as their attributes are often more cohesive than other professional guilds.</p>

    <p>Although the professions are fixed, the gameplay is indeed endless. A group of players with a common interest in the same profession gather together to work hard and develop new routines together. This is the unique charm of the two major unions from an outsider's perspective.</p>

    <p>It's Li Bai and Mang Shan!</p>

    <p>In addition to Lao Huang, other players who lined up to apply for Wolong recognized the two of them. Their thoughts on joining Fuyun Town became more determined.</p>

    <p>These are the presidents of two major guilds!</p>

    <p>Players at the boss level. Even such bosses choose to join the novice village. This shows that there is indeed something in Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>Many players were shaken in their hearts at first. Now that Li Bai and Mang Shan are here, they suddenly have a strong sense of belonging to Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>Many people also showed surprise in their hearts. While they were stunned by the appearance of Li Bai and Mang Shan, they also began to marvel at the methods of the person behind Fuyun Suppression.</p>

    <p>What kind of player is this? Can he actually create such a novice village in such an impressive way?</p>

    <p>Regarding this, the expressions on Sun Rong and Lao Huang's faces were undoubtedly helpless. Although Sun Rong now began to doubt whether the Fuyun Town general was an NPC pretended by the Zhenren player. But the other party's acting skills were really It was so exquisite that she couldn't find any flaws. She couldn't bear to expose it.</p>

    <p>If it is really an NPC player, everything Sun Rong is doing now is all due to the giant main quest that this NPC issued to him.</p>

    <p>That is to build Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>As for when this main line will be completed, even Sun Rong himself doesn't know. But as long as he can complete the upgrade and various construction activities in Fuyun Town, Sun Rong will be able to get a huge experience reward.</p>

    <p>Her level has also surpassed that of Lao Huang by 10 levels as the town has been upgraded. And Lao Huang has also risen by 5 levels.</p>

    <p>So now Huang's level is level 38. Sun Rong is level 48.</p>

    <p>A novice village. A level 48 ancient heavy armored monk player. This is outrageous!</p>

    <p>"I'm really sorry for disturbing everyone's recruitment. Mangshan and I are here to discuss whether we can build our branch guild in Fuyun Town. But the process of this matter is very long. I'm afraid of wasting everyone's time. I'll just wait for everyone today. After the recruitment is over, I'll come back to discuss it."</p>

    <p>On Pegasus. Li Bai's reply was polite. He didn't want to be offended. It was rumored that high-level players bullied low-level players based on their level and status.</p>

    <p>All replies follow his personal style. They are very polite and rigorous. They are refreshing. They don't feel bullied at all. Instead, they have a sense of equality.</p>

    <p>This is also the impression many players have on Li Bai.</p>

    <p>As for Mangshan...</p>

    <p>Everyone also knows that he has a very good relationship with Li Bai. The two often hang out. Compared to Li Bai, he has a more informal style and is very righteous. Sometimes he will personally lead a team to help low-level players clear dungeons.</p>

    <p>But sometimes when the beating gets too much, all kinds of vulgar words come out. But when Li Bai is around, it's much better.</p>

    <p>Basically, Li Bai did what he said. He just had to follow the example.</p>

    <p>I saw Mangshan hammering his chest. He laughed and said, "Me too!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>But to everyone's surprise, such a harmonious scene was quickly broken by a sudden person.</p>

    <p>Not far away, a large number of people and horses came with flying swords. The leader was riding the iconic armored flying elephant. Behind him were more than a dozen members of the guild. This group of people was surrounded by a huge crowd of people in the sky. Come. From a distance, there is a strong sense of oppression like dark clouds pressing over the city.</p>

    <p>"It's the Four Elephants!" Many people in the city of Fuyun Town recognized this posture. As soon as they saw that they were members of the Four Elephants, and it was led by Xiong Wu, many people immediately felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>It's not just Li Bai and Mang Shan. The rest of the novice players, as long as they are not Jian Immortal players, almost all have some complaints about the Four Elephants. They bully newcomers and organize robberies in the game. Those are all things the Four Elephants have done.</p>

    <p>Although this is just a game. If you die once, you will lose equipment, experience and levels. You will also be resurrected at the rebirth point. However, bullying others is still unpleasant.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that everyone is still helpless against the arrogance of Xiong Wu and others. They do have the capital to be arrogant. The multiple routines of this professional sword immortal were all developed by the members of the Four Elephants headed by Xiong Wu.</p>

    <p>It's like an intellectual property developer. If you use other people's routines to play games, at least the people who use the routines won't be able to criticize you.</p>

    <p>As a result, Xiongwu has gained many loyal fans of sword immortal players.</p>

    <p>If Xiong Wu came here alone, everyone would know what this guy wanted to do. It was nothing more than robbery.</p>

    <p>But now Li Bai and Mang Shan are also present. Everyone knows at once. This matter is going to become more complicated. It has become a battle between the two forces.</p>

    <p>Li Bai and Mangshan can be regarded as one party, while Sixiangzhong is obviously the other party.</p>

    <p>"Fuyun Town. Tell me! How much can you pay? You can sell it to me. I, the Four Elephants, have decided to accept it!"</p>

    <p>On top of the armored flying elephant, Xiong Wu opened his mouth with wealth and wealth. There was a simple stone box in his hand. After opening it, an orange glare emitted from it.</p>

    <p>"The Orange Box!" Many people saw this scene and were horrified.</p>

    <p>This is an equipment box that can open random equipment. The orange light indicates that you will definitely get an orange equipment!</p>

    <p>In the eyes of other players, this thing is priceless!</p>

    <p>"This is the box I just got from Hei Long's cave. I haven't confirmed the box opening yet. But everyone has seen it. You can 100% get an orange equipment in it. I want to use this orange equipment box. Replace this one. City. It shouldn't be difficult, right?" Xiong Wu said confidently.</p>

    <p>The difficulty of obtaining orange equipment is extremely difficult in the world of Itinerant Immortal. The overall value is overflowing.</p>

    <p>Now Xiongwu directly took out this box in exchange, which made everyone find it hard to imagine.</p>

    <p>But Lao Huang laughed and didn't buy it at all.</p>

    <p>He secretly said to Sun Rong: "Don't be fooled. With this guy's character, even if he gives you the orange box, he will definitely let the boys in the guild snatch it back after you open it."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Liu frowned slightly. Of course she knew the stakes here. Seeing that Xiong Wu wanted to take the city by force, she quickly said: "Wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, you are the deputy city lord of this city? In other words, the upgrading of Fuyun Town and the annihilation of the nearby Baidong Demon Lord are more or less related to you?" Xiongwu squinted Sun RongAt a glance. When the player saw that this was a heavily armored monk, he couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, this profession is not very useful. It is too novice-oriented. It has thick health, but the damage is too low. It does not pose a threat to him at all.</p>

    <p>He could even kill Hei Long, let alone a mere heavy-armored monk.</p>

    <p>At this time, Xiong Wu pulled out his sword and pointed it directly at Sun Rong. There was a threat in his words: "Speak. Will you give me your city or not?"</p>

    <p>"This gentleman, isn't he a bit too domineering? There are many masters in Fuyun Town." Sun Rong took a deep breath. She felt Xiong Wu's arrogance and domineering attitude, but she was not afraid at all.</p>

    <p>"Overbearing? Sorry. I've always been like this!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in Xiong Wu's hand burned like a flame. Then he drew a crescent-shaped sword energy and attacked Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>He reserved his strength. He never used all his strength. His purpose was just to injure Sun Rong as a deterrent.</p>

    <p>Li Bai and Mangshan were both worried. They called Xiongwu shameless!</p>

    <p>As for Xiong Wu, he said while swinging his sword: "I'm sorry. My hand slipped..."</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>As a result, the sword energy landed on Sun Rong's armor...</p>

    <p>The damage value turned out to be: 10!</p>

    <p>Many people couldn't help but rub their eyes when they saw this. They thought they had seen it wrong.</p>

    <p>This is powerful!</p>

    <p>There are 60 levels!</p>

    <p>Beat a level 48 player. Even if you swing the sword without using full strength, it won't only deduct 10 blood points!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>She now knows why she exists. Maybe there really is a nemesis in this world.</p>

    <p>To be brave is to be strong.</p>

    <p>But no matter how strong it is, it is impossible to imagine it.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has a divine skill [Jian Lai Gong] in his body at the initial stage.</p>

    <p>The damage of all sword attacks benefits from the passive ability of [Sword Lai Gong]. When hitting Sun Rong, it will be directly reduced by 75%! Not only that. In addition, Sun Rong is also rough-skinned and thick-skinned. Ancient heavily armored monk.</p>

    <p>It can be said that it may be much easier to kill Hei Long than to kill Sun Rong for the current Sixiangzhong Sword Immortal players...</p>
