  <h1>Chapter 1664 Furong's Wrath</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Virtual Realm. The core area of the Imperial City. In the central hall of the huge castle.</p>

    <p>On the gleaming king's chair embedded with various beautiful crystal stones, an old gentleman wearing a gold-rimmed spectacles sat on it. He held the black scepter in his hand with both hands and narrowed his eyes into a straight line. The seam has an invisible air and a very distinctive face. The most conspicuous part is the pitch black mole at the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Sir, Hei Long has been captured. But when he was captured, he had already killed three past commanders." A floating spherical guard entered the palace and emitted an electronic sound to inform him of the current situation.</p>

    <p>"This matter should not be made public. Those past commanders have also made backup avatars before. Have they been replaced?" Nawei responded calmly, holding on to the scepter.</p>

    <p>"All of them have been replaced with the newly developed New Ancient Divine Weapons. As of now, the families of these killed commanders still have not reacted."</p>

    <p>"Yes. this thing was done beautifully." Nawei smiled: "Shou Chong and Hei Long are all in place. The merger of the God's Brain has been completed. Now we are just waiting for Mr. Gong to volunteer his body Have...have they...arrived?"</p>

    <p>"Yes Lord Nawei. They have entered Ducas' mansion."</p>

    <p>"Send people over immediately. Surround the mansion. Be sure to capture Gong alive. Try not to damage her body."</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>After arranging all this, sitting on the king's chair, Nawei breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>At that time, his master, Master Wu Xin, divided the brain tissue of his left and right brains into separate portions.</p>

    <p>One of them had already been implanted in Hei Long when he was created.</p>

    <p>And the other part is in Shou Chong's body.</p>

    <p>After years of painstaking planning, the brain of God has finally been assembled. This makes Nawei feel very unhappy.</p>

    <p>Of course. One thing that makes him more happy is.</p>

    <p>He found a body more suitable for creating New Ancient Divine Weapons for mass production...</p>

    <p>If we could get such a body, we would replace the existing materials with the latest bionic technology.</p>

    <p>His New Ancient Divine Weapons. Will be invincible...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Following the address given by Ducas before, Sun Rong and others arrived at this magnificent private residence. Scardy had already been in the core area through his own connections and channels when he was in the slums. Construction and operation within.</p>

    <p>The purpose is to wait for the day when he gets the pass and becomes a real master. He can drag his family and move directly into this magnificent house.</p>

    <p>This is the lifelong wish of all humble people.</p>

    <p>Although Ducas is different from the ordinary "untouchables", he is the most promising among the "ascended people" in the slums to enter the core area and move to live in this huge and splendid imperial city. But the "ascended people" are in the archives They are still classified in the "low status" area.</p>

    <p>The only difference is that their assets and connections are comparable to those of ordinary Jiji people. They belong to high-level Jiji people.</p>

    <p>But now, the situation has completely changed. Ducas finally realized what he had dreamed of for many years. He moved into a large house that he had already laid out. He could settle down comfortably in this imperial city, take ten or eight wives, and raise a family. Pile of cute babies. Live the life you want.</p>

    <p>At least. That's what Jiugong Liangzi thought when he saw this mansion. Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, when they actually entered the mansion, the strange tranquility inside was beyond Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi's expectations.</p>

    <p>As a powerful ascendant, Ducas had already begun to complete the layout of the interior of the Imperial City since he had the ability to stay in the slums. It is impossible that such a huge mansion does not even have a single hired servant.</p>

    <p>"It's a bit strange. Rongrong..." the team voice channel. Jiugong Liangzi couldn't help but become a little nervous. She grabbed Sun Rong's cloak. She could clearly feel that something was wrong with the atmosphere in the mansion.</p>

    <p>"I can feel the breath of Mr. Ducas. It should be in this room in front of me..." Sun Rong led the way. She actually had an ominous premonition in her heart.</p>

    <p>Relying on the powerful passive perception ability of man and sword, Aohai still recognized Ducas' aura in this mansion. But this aura was very weak.</p>

    <p>He was completely different from the Ducas who had parted with them on the road leading to the core area.</p>

    <p>After they arrived at the core area, their first reaction was not to complete Zhu Yuanrun's mission and really hunt down Hei Long. It was because of what Monk Jin Deng said. They wanted to catch up with Ducas as soon as possible to avoid Ducas being in danger.</p>

    <p>But judging from the current situation, Sun Rong realized that they were still a step too late after all.</p>

    <p>Although Ducas walked in front of them, the time apart was only less than an hour!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ducas..."</p>

    <p>In front of the main door of the inner hall, Sun Rong clicked the door. The door was not completely locked. It opened easily with just a slight click.</p>

    <p>The inner hall was deathly silent. After the call from Sun Rong, there was a strange and slight whimpering sound.</p>

    <p>The voice was muffled. You couldn't hear what was being said at all. And if you didn't listen carefully, you wouldn't even notice it at all.</p>

    <p>Under extreme anxiety, Sun Rong finally walked to a wooden wine barrel hidden at the back of the inner hall.</p>

    <p>And the breath of Ducas.</p>

    <p>Just inside this wooden wine barrel...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong gritted his teeth and mustered up the courage to lift the lid of the barrel. A foul smell immediately hit his face. It was a complex and unbearable rancid smell. It seemed that it had been marinated for a long time. Spoiled meat products.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Because right inside this barrel, an eyeball was looking at them. Even though Ducas's appearance was completely unrecognizable, Sun Rong could still tell that it was Ducas's eye.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ducas..."Sun Rong's eyes turned red instantly. He tried to use Aohai's healing sword energy to repair it.</p>

    <p>However, this is no longer a futile effort.</p>

    <p>Ducas had been killed long before they arrived.</p>

    <p>Such a big piece was chopped into pieces and put in this wine barrel together with the scattered parts...</p>

    <p>"This is his rightful calamity. The healing sword can save the living. But it has no effect on the dead." Monk Jin Deng sighed. He made a Buddhist salute to the barrel. The light of the Buddha has condensed in his hand.</p>

    <p>If this light shines, Ducas can quickly end his pain and enter a new reincarnation.</p>

    <p>But before lighting this light, Jin Deng seemed to have thought of something. He extracted the inaudible whimpering sounds in the barrel.</p>

    <p>Condensed into a short string of words...</p>

    <p>This is the death information that Ducas gathered using his obsession before he was killed.</p>

    <p>There are only two words: run away.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it's because he left his address before. He expected that we would come to him. That's why he left this message."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng sighed. He spread out his Buddha's hands, which were covered with golden light and filled with the boundless power of Buddhism: "Mr. Ducas. Your message has been received by the young monk and the two girls. Have a good trip... young monk Guess, you will be extremely happy in the next life..."</p>

    <p>A ray of light fell down.</p>

    <p>In the wooden barrel, Ducas took his last obsession and turned it into particles of gold powder. It floated to the pure land of bliss...</p>

    <p>After all this. He saw that the two emotional girls were both in tears. He comforted them by saying, "Miss Rong. And... Liangzi. Right now. The battle is not over yet. Keep moving forward."</p>

    <p>He felt that his words were not comforting.</p>

    <p>Modern cultivators have not experienced too many past wars.</p>

    <p>However, the peace that I was used to enjoying has faded away. The true path of cultivation is often much more cruel than modern cultivation.</p>

    <p>This truth can only be understood after personal experience.</p>

    <p>Touching the cycle of life and death...</p>

    <p>Except for that man, no one has the ability to change the determined outcome.</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng. I understand."</p>

    <p>After wiping away the tears from the corners of his eyes, Sun Rong raised his eyes and scanned the surrounding area with his spiritual consciousness: "Come out... I will wait for Mr. Ducas and return his pain to you double. !"</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A powerful sword energy suddenly roared out of Sun Rong's body!</p>

    <p>In this moment, Jiugong Liangzi next to him was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong..." She felt that Sun Rong seemed like a different person. In other words... her previous understanding of Sun Rong was completely incomplete.</p>

    <p>The sword energy emanating from her body is too strong...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi thought that he had only experienced this feeling of awe once since he was so old, when he had the honor to meet the famous sword master in Huaxiu!</p>

    <p>And now, the sword energy erupting from Sun Rong's body... seems to be more violent than the impact she had when she saw the Sword Master!</p>

    <p>This is the real thing. Hibiscus Fury.</p>
