  <h1>Chapter 2137 The world of falsehood and reality</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If someone else had said these words, Shou Chong would only think that this person was probably suffering from some kind of hysteria. No matter how bold his idea was, he would not make such an outrageous inference.</p>

    <p>But if this person is Wang Ming, the situation will be different. This man has received the help of the divine brain. It is no longer the same.</p>

    <p>Maybe you can really see things that outsiders can't see through, but it's not necessarily true.</p>

    <p>"So. What basis do you have?" Shou Chong asked.</p>

    <p>"I saw a layer of gray mist. The world wrapped in the Itinerant Immortal magic ring."</p>

    <p>"But this is just a virtual game... how can you set up a wall in the game..."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was surprised.</p>

    <p>The wall of spiritual consciousness is a real thing. It is equivalent to a magic circle. The layout is very particular and secretive. It has the function of shielding the mind and reversing the thinking and will.</p>

    <p>You can use external force to destroy the basic components that build the wall of spiritual consciousness. But this choice is unrealistic. It is equivalent to starting a war.</p>

    <p>That's why Wang Ming thought of using a roundabout method. That is, this Operation Wall Breaker, to allow the local monks in Mixiu Country whose minds are controlled to have true self-awareness, thereby affecting the equipment of the Wall of Spiritual Consciousness.</p>

    <p>When more Michu monks awaken to their true thinking and will, the wall of spiritual consciousness must use greater power to suppress it. When the core cannot bear it, it will naturally collapse directly from the inside.</p>

    <p>No matter how sophisticated the scientific instrument of cultivation is, without going through the Heavenly Dao enlightenment technique of Wang Ling, its load capacity will be limited after all.</p>

    <p>And Brother Michu, who has awakened to his true thinking, is like a walking high-memory consumption software. When more and more software are opened, the crash will naturally only happen on a thin line.</p>

    <p>But now Wang Ming suspects that there is a wall of spiritual consciousness in the game world of Itinerant Immortal... This seems a bit incredible to Shou Chong...</p>

    <p>This is a game developed and designed by Bai Qiao. As a game developer, how can there be a wall?</p>

    <p>People from the Office of Strategic Deception were involved throughout the entire research and development phase.</p>

    <p>If this is all covered by the existence of a wall... wouldn't it just prove that there is a mole inside the Office of Strategic Deception!?</p>

    <p>This isn't right either...</p>

    <p>This is the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>A place where big bosses gather. It's so easy for moles to appear.</p>

    <p>The most unlikely place in the world for a mole to appear is the Office of Strategic Deception. The other is the Sixty Gates.</p>

    <p>Although the specifications are different, they are both a land of hidden dragons and crouching tigers.</p>

    <p>"Who put up the wall?"</p>

    <p>"It's not clear yet."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned.</p>

    <p>Judging from his current judgment, the gray fog surrounding the Itinerant Immortal game world is unusual.</p>

    <p>It is something similar in function to the wall of spiritual consciousness. But the specifications are far beyond the wall of spiritual consciousness itself.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it.</p>

    <p>This more advanced "Wall of Spiritual Consciousness" is definitely not the work of anyone currently on earth. It is most likely the work of Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>"Has it started since the closed beta..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming quickly thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>He thought of the sudden black screen incident during the closed beta phase of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring.</p>

    <p>That was a bug that even the official could not explain correctly. Bai Qiao also classified that incident as a code conflict error. After all, it is impossible to be completely free of bugs in the programming process of game software. Even after fixing one, there may still be bugs. There are more bugs appearing at the same time...</p>

    <p>But now, Wang Ming felt like something was suddenly enlightening in his mind. He had thought everything clearly.</p>

    <p>After all, the Itinerant Immortal magic ring was established in accordance with the rules of cultivation. It is an extremely strict world of cultivation. It is not impossible if Qiao Yanyuan's forces under Bai Zhe began to make plans during the inner period.</p>

    <p>So in the huge Itinerant Immortal world, among those players! Insiders have been implanted!</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that there would be such a way to invade the earth..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was so frightened that he was sweating when he thought of this. He was shocked: "So, what is their purpose?"</p>

    <p>"On the one hand, I want to use this method to peek at the earth. On the other hand, I also want to use this method to treat trapped players in the entire game world as hostages." Wang Ming analyzed.</p>

    <p>After all. There is still Wang Ling on the earth.</p>

    <p>Neither Bai Zhe, who is in the form of a Yueguang Dragon, nor Fenmu Shen, who has inherited the Heavenly Dao tradition and claims to be omniscient and omnipotent, can peer into the earth from the outside.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the way it penetrates from the game world into the earth is indeed quite creative.</p>

    <p>But they didn't expect it, but they probably didn't expect that the man who acted like a cheater. Even if he entered the game world at this moment, his soul was separated from the body... he could still cheat in the game world...</p>

    <p>"The order will break the gray fog."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>He has every reason to believe it. Wang Ling is probably aware of the anomalies in the world of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The world of Itinerant Immortal is shrouded in an unknown gray fog. Wang Ling has been aware of it since entering the game.</p>

    <p>At first, he thought it was a map setting in the game. It was like many games would define a map range for themselves.</p>

    <p>The seemingly vast ocean actually has boundaries in the game world. The player drives an immortal boat. When it reaches the boundary, it cannot go any further.</p>

    <p>But soon Wang Ling noticed something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because of this layer of black mist, it cannot be converted into data code in the eyes of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yes. In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, Wang Ling is actually in a state of being forcibly weakened by a debuff. After all, it is in the game world. His King's Eyes ability cannot be directly brought in.</p>

    <p>Without the help of King's Eyes, everything will become troublesome.</p>

    <p>But King's Eyes cannot be used.</p>

    <p>It doesn't mean that he can't summon others.</p>

    <p>In his display cabinet of gods, there is a pair of pupils like this, which are specially used when the soul leaves the body or enters the virtual space.</p>

    <p>Dao Number 04 Eye Pupil: The True and True Yuan Shen Dharma Eye. The dark brown appearance is no different from a normal human pupil. But if you look closely, you will find that the periphery of the pupil has a gear shape.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling cannot invoke King's Eyes ability at this moment.</p>

    <p>He can also analyze the reality of this game world through Road Number 04.</p>

    <p>The function of Road Number 04 is very simple.</p>

    <p>It means seeing through all illusions.</p>

    <p>After activating the ability of Eye Pupil Number 04, Wang Ling saw that everything around him turned into codes composed of various characters and 0, 1. Even Sun Rong and Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>When Number 04 is activated, they all become cold code symbols.</p>

    <p>Only the gray fog in the sky has never dissipated...</p>

    <p>A virtual game world. It stands to reason that there can be no real things that are not codes.</p>

    <p>But the emergence of this layer of gray fog means that the nature of the game has changed.</p>

    <p>It affects the virtual world. Not only will it block the connection between players in the game and the outside world, but it will also swallow up the virtual world step by step. It will gradually assimilate this world and turn it into reality.</p>

    <p>That is to say...</p>

    <p>Soon.</p>

    <p>When the density of the fog rises a little higher, all the players in the Itinerant Immortal ring will become real people. Not just simple data.</p>

    <p>That is to say.</p>

    <p>When a player dies in the Itinerant Immortal magic circle, it may directly affect the real world.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling. Bai Zhe and Qiao Yanyuan are quite creative.</p>

    <p>Thinking of invading the earth in this way.</p>

    <p>And it's obvious that they have been plotting for a long time.</p>

    <p>But the only thing these two people missed was...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also entered this world.</p>

    <p>The function of gray fog is to affect players in the entire game world and make players real.</p>

    <p>This also means that Wang Ling himself will gradually become real.</p>

    <p>He was debuffed by the game. But Bai Zhe and Qiao Yanyuan actually tried to strengthen him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that.</p>

    <p>There is such a good thing...</p>
