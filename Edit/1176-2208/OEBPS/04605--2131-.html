  <h1>Chapter 2131 Wang Ling New Identity + Five</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This is just Mr. Zanghu's personal guess. In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, there are very few people who directly seize power and become generals or city lords in places like Novice Village.</p>

    <p>After all, this is just a small town. And the overall rating of all novice villages is the same. They are all the lowest D level. It depends on the resources around the town. It is divided into three levels: upper, middle and lower.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this division is of little significance. After all, with limited troops, resources are mined slowly, and it is easy for the town to lack defense capabilities. Once it is invaded by foreign enemies, it will only take a matter of minutes.</p>

    <p>Even if he becomes the master of Novice Village, he will end up with a failure.</p>

    <p>But if combined with other solutions, it might be feasible.</p>

    <p>This plan is to control the surrounding demon spirit caves so that the demon spirits can become the labor force for their own resource extraction. The demon spirits do not need to consume food and materials. This can be said to be a loophole in the current game settings.</p>

    <p>Collect materials through demon spirits. Replace the town's original resources for mining materials. Let real human monk soldiers return to the city to set up defenses. This way you can get the best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>It can be said that it is the best of all three.</p>

    <p>Because even at this time, when the "Novice Village" is invaded by other foreign enemies, the demon spirits assigned to mine materials can still defend themselves in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that you will never know how much control over the demon spirits the city lord of this town or the general who actually controls the city has.</p>

    <p>Because the number of demon spirits will not be displayed in the game.</p>

    <p>To ensure fairness, when players choose to attack a city, they will only see the estimated strength of the opponent's city the day before, and then decide whether to launch an attack.</p>

    <p>The reason why there is no real-time updated data is also to make players think twice before attacking a city. Some cities seem to have very few troops. The value is deliberately kept at a very low value. Then after receiving information that may be attacked, After the news. Urgently ask for help and borrow troops from surrounding allied towns.</p>

    <p>This directly created a natural trap. When people actually attacked, they found that the number of people was basically different from what the system showed. There was a big discrepancy!</p>

    <p>As I approached the city gate, I discovered that the opponent's strength was actually eight to one compared to my own!</p>

    <p>It's a damn thing if you can beat this!</p>

    <p>In the inner link, many players have formed alliances and deceived many people in this way.</p>

    <p>But the Fuyun Town run by Wang Ling is just a novice village...a novice village with no foundation or heritage at all...</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that the general of this novice village would have such power and courage?</p>

    <p>Therefore, the current Fuyun Town looks like an ordinary novice village, and it is very likely that it is also a hidden trap of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</p>

    <p>It would be interesting if there was a stupid young man who went to attack this without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>What a pity...</p>

    <p>While Mr. Zanghu was collecting mushrooms, he was also thinking about his own little calculation in his mind.</p>

    <p>He has selected a new town map. He plans to develop in a higher-level town. He has to bid farewell to Huanglong Town. The distance from Fuyun Town will also be further increased. Otherwise, with his good-humored temperament that loves to join in the fun, he would really go and see it. Watch the excitement.</p>

    <p>But now all the money for hiring the fleet has been spent. The route cannot be changed at will.</p>

    <p>However, the game has just begun.</p>

    <p>This is Fuyun Town. Mr. Zanghu has finally memorized it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The sentry was killed by Wang Ling. A terrifying tide of monsters roared up within the Baidong area. The Demon Lord of the Hundred Caves woke up. And directly instigated a strange phenomenon - the Ten Thousand Demonic Crystal Flowers.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the entire forest seemed to have fallen into an illusory and alien space. It became a crystallized world. Purple-blue crystals covered the forest. The place was completely covered with a layer of warning color by the Demon Lord of Hundred Cave.</p>

    <p>Blue animals and plants are very rare in nature. Those animals and plants with blue color often indicate warning, danger and poison. Such terrible natural phenomena are rare in real life. After all, the worlds of humans and monsters are currently inseparable from each other. Violation of the state of peaceful development.</p>

    <p>But after seeing it with my own eyes, this shocking feeling is difficult to describe in words. Sun RongAlthough Sun Rong has killed the Old God and been to alien planets, the ancestors of the Sun family also had a history of vigorous battles with the demon world. But as a descendant of the Sun family, her knowledge of the demon clan is not comprehensive. She has only heard about it from Er Ha's mouth.</p>

    <p>After all, the relationship between Wang Ling and Sun Rong is not that close yet.</p>

    <p>In the huge mountainous area, a humanoid creature with one horn appeared. His horn was colored glaze, emitting a dazzling light. When viewed from a distance, there was a sense of majesty. This was the Demon Lord of the Hundred Cave.</p>

    <p>Monsters that evolve into human form are rare. Obviously, this Hundred Cave Demon Lord is not an easy boss to deal with. At least for many people in the Novice Village, this is a monster that cannot be provoked in the early stage.</p>

    <p>No one would meet this monster swordsman directly in the novice stage with a huge difference in level and attributes. He was wearing glazed armor. It was not a manufactured armor, but a naturally formed one. It was on his body. Something that already exists.</p>

    <p>From this Wang Ling can be concluded that the prototype of the Hundred Cave Demon Lord may be a monster beast covered with thick glazed scales.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that he doesn't know much about monsters. There are thousands of races in the monster world. Wang Ling won't remember many useless things... He only remembers Er Ha, Monster Saint and Shen Wuyue. As for the others. Regardless of whether it is the district demon god or the local demon king. Wang Ling feels that there is no need to write down this information.</p>

    <p>Because these creatures cannot defeat him at all. So Wang Ling feels there is no need to remember...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't dare to move at all. She intuitively felt that this Baidong Demon Lord was a question mark-level boss. No matter how ridiculously close Fuyun Town was, it shouldn't be possible...</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she saw Wang Ling walking forward slowly and leisurely like last time.</p>

    <p>"General?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suddenly opened her mouth. No matter what, she couldn't believe that the scene in front of her would happen again.</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Wang Ling said coldly in a changed voice: "Health Bar Clearing Technique."</p>

    <p>The next moment, he raised his hand. A beam of light rushed out from his fingertips. It turned into a terrifying light and directly penetrated the forehead of the glass demon...</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The Hundred Cave Demon Lord, who had hundreds of thousands of drops of blood, fell directly in response. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw it. The Hundred Cave Demon Lord turned into powder and dissipated, leaving behind equipment that fell all over the ground. At the same time, it opened in response. There were also dark clouds that reopened. When the sun shines in the blue sky After it was illuminated again, the glazed equipment here was also reflected and shimmering. Shining...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has no interest in the equipment on the ground.</p>

    <p>This was left to Sun Rong on purpose.</p>

    <p>He is only slightly interested in his new identity.</p>

    <p>Now after opening the character bar, a series of identity information is immediately displayed.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling's identities include [waste], [prison leader], [General Chen of Fuyun Town], [Demon Lord of Ten Caves of Fuyun Town] and [Demon Lord of Hundred Caves of Fuyun Town]...</p>
