  <h1>Chapter 1980 Two fools</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"This man's name is Li Changzhe. He is the chairman of the student union of Jingmen Number 8 High School in Jinghua City. He came to Songhai this time because of the spiritual world trial."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi drove here by himself. While driving, he introduced the situation to Luo Lan: "Because there was an accident at the Spiritual World Training Ground yesterday. He will temporarily stay with the students from other places who came to Songhai City for training. They were arranged to check in at the hotel."</p>

    <p>"Fellow Daoist Zhuo's intelligence network is really powerful..."</p>

    <p>Luo Lan was filled with emotion. He was still very confident in accepting Li Changzhe as his disciple. After all, Mist Technique was an unpopular spell type. And most of the Mist Technique practitioners decided to do so after hearing his legendary deeds.</p>

    <p>In other words, Luo Lan had already guessed it before he came to Songhai City. The probability that Li Changzhe is his fan is very high.</p>

    <p>He is only worried about one thing now. That is that Li Changzhe will be poached by others. And since the spiritual world trial is led by Jiutian Jingmi Institute.</p>

    <p>So for Jingmi Academy, which likes to recruit elites, Li Changzhe must be a key training target. Even if he wants to personally mentor Li Changzhe in the future, he won't have a good time...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi seemed to have guessed what Luo Lan was thinking. He smiled while driving: "It is true that Jiutian Jingmi Academy is recruiting talents. But I think this does not conflict with Master Luo Lan's recruitment of disciples. And there's nothing wrong with receiving the attention of Jiutian Jingmi Academy. That means he can enjoy cultivation benefits that ordinary high school students can't imagine, right?"</p>

    <p>"Master Luo Lan, don't worry too much. At worst, you can try to learn modern technology. If you want to give guidance to Student Li, you can do it through remote online teaching."</p>

    <p>These words made Luo Lan feel enlightened: "This... what Fellow Taoist Zhuo said is true... but you know, I have been living in seclusion in the mountains and forests for a long time. I am still not familiar with these modern technologies..."</p>

    <p>"I can find someone to teach Master Luo Lan. In this way, the master does not have to worry about losing face in front of his disciples. Besides, Classmate Li is so outstanding. There must be many people who want to accept him as a disciple. For such an outstanding person Disciple, Master Luo Lan, should learn modern technology. It's worth sacrificing a little time, right?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Lan felt as if he had been beaten to death. He nodded quickly, like a chicken pecking rice: "Yes! Fellow Taoist Zhuo is right! As long as I can accept this peerless genius as a disciple, there is a successor! The path of a cultivator is to learn endlessly. I am indeed too pedantic... For the sake of classmate Li, it is okay to learn some modern technology!"</p>

    <p>"That's easy to handle."Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was just two hours before meeting Luo Lan.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi just met Li Changzhe in private.</p>

    <p>"Are you... Zhuo Yi!?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe covered his mouth. His face was full of surprise. He never expected that Zhuo Yi would appear in his room without anyone noticing.</p>

    <p>He was so frightened that he almost screamed. But he quickly calmed down after seeing this familiar face. Zhuo Yi's face often appeared on TV... He was so familiar.</p>

    <p>The city hero six years ago is now the idol of almost every high school student. Not just here in Songhai City. He is also very famous even in other places.</p>

    <p>Especially this year. Zhuo Yi is also one of the key candidates for the position of deputy leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance. It has attracted the attention of many people.</p>

    <p>"I am Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi admitted generously. He smiled like a spring breeze: "You can call me Brother Zhuo."</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo... I don't understand everything. What do you mean by showing up in my room this early in the morning?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe looked at him with a hint of horror on his face: "I am a serious person who likes girls!"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! Who doesn't like girls seriously?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I'm sorry. Blame me for coming too abruptly and not explaining the situation to you in advance. Actually, it's like this. Your performance in the spiritual world this time is very good. I have a friend who wants to accept you as a disciple. His name is Luo Lan. I wonder if you are interested."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Changzhe was immediately shocked: "Luo... Master Luo Lan! Brother Zhuo, you actually know Master Luo Lan! He has always been my idol! I have followed him since elementary school! I like him very much. My mist-resolving technique is also related to him..."</p>

    <p>"eh... I understand how you feel."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. His life was saved by Wang Ling. By mistake, he became the city hero who defeated the demon king. The admiration and love for Wang Ling are the same as now. Li Changzhe is so similar. Zhuo Yi is so understandable.</p>

    <p>"But Master Luo Lan is not good at words and doesn't like socializing. His acceptance of a disciple this time is an exceptional act. I'll just tell you straight."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Li Changzhe and said: "Master Luo Lan comes to see you this time. He wants to accept you as a true disciple. In other words, the identity of master and disciple between you and him. Except Master Luo Lan, you can't tell others."</p>

    <p>"Understood. Keep a low profile." Li Changzhe nodded.</p>

    <p>"One more thing. Master Luo Lan will come to your room to see you later. This matter must be hidden from everyone in Jiutian Jingmi Academy. I believe you can handle it, okay?"</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>"Besides this, there is another point. In the future, you still have to obey the arrangements of Jiutian Jingmi Academy. Master Luo Lan's initial teaching for you may be in the form of online classes."</p>

    <p>"Online classes..."</p>

    <p>"It would be a bit unrealistic for him to take you away directly. This is a decision made after comprehensive consideration. If you can worship your idol as your master, and he is such a good master, it should be worth the sacrifice in the early stage. Right?" Zhuo Yi patted Li Changzhe on the shoulder and said.</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Li Changzhe felt as if he had been beaten to death. He nodded quickly, like a chicken pecking at rice: "Yes! Brother Zhuo is right! As long as I can worship Master Luo Lan as my master, I am willing to die. For the sake of Master, I am willing to cooperate with all Master's actions!"</p>

    <p>"Very good."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded with satisfaction: "There is one last thing. That Zhanye. I need to commandeer it."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Don't I need to give this sword to Jiutian Jingmi Academy?" Li Changzhe asked.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he felt uneasy having Zhanye staying with him. This sword was too weird... Carrying it with him was like carrying a bomb.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe didn't sleep well last night because of this incident. Although now he also heard what experts said. It was said that the collapse of the spirit world trial field was because his sword energy happened to hit the secret door...</p>

    <p>But the destructive power of that sword was still frightening to Li Changzhe when he thought about it. He did not dare to use it a second time.</p>

    <p>"Master Luo Lan is also very interested in this sword. So he wants to borrow it for study. But in name, it cannot be said that Master Luo Lan borrowed it. If anyone asks, just say that this sword has been recovered by me. No one will come to trouble you." Zhuo Yi stretched out his hand. Then he showed a kind smile.</p>
