  <h1>Chapter 1997 The Distant Temple</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As an excellent scapegoat. Zhuo Yi has never worried about how to make meritorious deeds.</p>

    <p>Because there are many such opportunities, and they will be sent directly to him from time to time. But the problem is how to transfer this credit to Jiugong Liangzi. This is a big problem.</p>

    <p>The difficulty of handling this matter is not that high. After all, the whole matter must be in line with the interests of Huaxiu. It must make a major and outstanding contribution.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi I really didn't know where to start. He didn't even dare to tell Jiugong Liangzi directly about this matter.</p>

    <p>She is too strong headed. It is precisely because he knows her personality so well that once Jiugong Liangzi finds out about this matter, she may not be so willing to cooperate.</p>

    <p>Saturday, January 18th.</p>

    <p>After chatting with Sun Dakang, on the day Zhuo Yi returned to Songhai City, Jiugong Liangzi personally picked up Zhuo Yi at the airport.</p>

    <p>The stretch limousine with Jiugong's purple crow logo and Jiugong's imprint was parked at the entrance of the airport, attracting many people's attention.</p>

    <p>But in fact it was just a cover-up specially arranged by Jiugong Liangzi. Jiugong Liangzi has become extremely cautious since she got together with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She saw the onlookers taking pictures of the stretched luxury car. Jiugong Liangzi was wearing a down jacket and a hat and a mask. The moment she saw Zhuo Yi, she held his arms and dragged Zhuo Yi away.</p>

    <p>The two of them were silent all the way until they got into a black car that looked unusually low-key.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I told you not to pick me up. It's too much trouble for you." Zhuo Yi smiled. He couldn't help but reached out and pinched Jiugong Liangzi's earlobe.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Jiugong Liangzi blushed and buried her face in her scarf.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was responsible for driving. Just after stepping on the accelerator, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly asked in a low voice: "Went over this time. Did the negotiation go well?"</p>

    <p>"Smooth." Zhuo Yi replied readily.</p>

    <p>"real?"</p>

    <p>"real..."</p>

    <p>"Wrong."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi immediately frowned.</p>

    <p>Her sixth sense told her that Zhuo Yi was hiding something from herself.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Zhuo Yi forced a smile and said: "Hey, it's okay. It's just Principal Dai's matter. It's a bit troublesome. Although the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance is still trying to mediate, I think there will be a fight tomorrow. It's unavoidable."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he was still looking at Jiugong Liangzi with his peripheral vision. He was afraid that the girl would see through his little thoughts.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that women's intuition is really terrible... Even Zhuo Yi didn't expect Jiugong Liangzi to be so sensitive.</p>

    <p>"Just hit him."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi soon replied.</p>

    <p>It seems that she has no doubts for the time being: "You men are just not good enough. You are so panicked about such a trivial matter. When you defeated Tuntian Ha back then, you weren't that panicked, were you? What if Dai Tianchun was like that? If you want to fight, just let senior Jin Deng fight him... Anyone who offended the abbot, can they still leave?"</p>

    <p>"Pfft." Zhuo Yi couldn't help but laugh out loud: "I noticed that Liangzi you seem to have become humorous. Let's do this. I'll reward you. What do you want to eat? I'll take you there. Or... I can make it now."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "What's wrong?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "It's nothing. I just always feel that something is wrong. Are you really worried about that Dai Tianchun thing?"</p>

    <p>"Hey, men have to worry about something. Do you really want to hear it?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi finished speaking. The familiar laughter sounded in the car again: "That's right. I was wondering when we will get married."</p>

    <p>"Who... who wants to marry you! You're shameless!" Jiugong Liangzi snorted and turned her face to look directly out of the car window.</p>

    <p>Originally, this was Zhuo Yi's special move prepared to change the subject. But he never expected that Jiugong Liangzi would react like this...</p>

    <p>With Liangzi's character, isn't this the same as personally agreeing to the marriage?</p>

    <p>So at that moment, even Zhuo Yi's face turned red. It burned directly to the base of his ears...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy. Holy Clan Temple.</p>

    <p>A humanoid creature with a face shaped like a golden swirl and wearing a white robe walked on the red carpet leading to the center of the temple.</p>

    <p>It held the scepter. It came to the front of the throne respectfully. It bowed respectfully to the man with long golden hair on the throne: "His Royal Highness the Great and Eternal Holy King... I heard that you want to cooperate with that Bai Zhe?"</p>

    <p>"That's true." The man on the king's chair said.</p>

    <p>He was dressed entirely in golden phoenix armor. The fiery red magma cloak on his back exuded an astonishing temperature.</p>

    <p>It is an eternal cloak formed by refining several stars and condensing it. It always emits scorching light and heat. It can wrap up and swallow all planets.</p>

    <p>"The old minister has something to say. Please listen carefully to His Highness the Holy King... Bai Zhe. Although he has inherited the Dragon Clan's Moonlight Dragon Tradition, his origin is unknown. Your Highness the Holy King, you have to be careful..."</p>

    <p>"As long as there is strength, alliance cooperation is not a bad idea. Is the Holy Lord doubting my king's strategy?" the Holy King pondered.</p>

    <p>"I don't dare." The humanoid creature instantly knelt down on the ground and kowtowed: "It's just that when the Cosmic Embryo was still in the hands of my holy clan, I saw the origin of this person... He was also originally an Earthling. How can such a soul with a despicable bloodline be qualified to cooperate with our holy race? This person has been defeated repeatedly at the hands of the young man on earth. In the opinion of the veteran, this was done on purpose..."</p>

    <p>"You said... on purpose?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." The Holy Lord of the Holy Tribe nodded: "He was defeated many times, but he recovered even more powerfully than before. In this way, he constantly challenged the boy from Earth. In fact, the boy from Earth gained something in every battle. Extraordinary growth. This is a free gift of experience and life to that boy from Earth. We should strongly condemn it! Cooperate with caution!"</p>

    <p>These words caused the Holy King to fall into a brief silence.</p>

    <p>A moment later, his rich voice sounded in the hall again: "But the Cosmic Embryo of my Saint Clan has already fallen into the hands of that young man. If we want to snatch the Embryo back, with the current strength of our Saint Clan, it may be difficult to do so."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the Holy Lord suddenly laughed: "No matter how strong that boy from Earth is, he still doesn't know the horror of our Holy Clan. He doesn't even know that when the old minister handed over the Cosmic Embryo to him, he also left a mystery..."</p>

    <p>"There are countless beings in the universe who want to get the Cosmic Embryo. The Cosmic Embryo in the hands of that boy at the moment is like a transmitter. It will gather the strong men from all over the universe to compete for it."</p>

    <p>"The old minister deliberately handed Cosmic Embryo to him. It was because he was not aware of it."</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, only one Cosmic Embryo cannot exert its power. Only by collecting two Cosmic Embryo and knowing the secret of Cosmic Embryo can the true role of the embryo be brought into play. The other Cosmic Embryo. Our Saints have been looking for it for a long time. Didn't find it. The old minister didn't believe he could get two..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling was studying the Cosmic Embryo's in his bedroom.</p>

    <p>He just happened to see and hear this conversation from the Holy Clan Temple in the distant infinite galaxy...</p>
