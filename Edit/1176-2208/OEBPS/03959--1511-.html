  <h1>Chapter 1511 Run? Can you run away...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Finally solved the problem of all the students at Jiudaohe High School who were forcibly transformed into "ghosts."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took back the clone. And opened its eyes.</p>

    <p>For those students who have helped them, the appearance of these clones is indeed like a dream that seems to be absent.</p>

    <p>There is a bit of illusion in the reality.</p>

    <p>By the time they/they came to their senses, the young man named "Houlang" in their memory had already left.</p>

    <p>Then they forgot what "Houlang" looked like. They also forgot the oozing appearance after they turned into ghosts.</p>

    <p>The only thing I remember in my mind is the illusory scene when the young man named "Houlang" left with a light like an angel coming...</p>

    <p>Like a young shining angel from heaven. Fluttering his feathers. Not leaving a single cloud behind...</p>

    <p>Later, Wang Ling carved the memories of the clones he had recovered into "dreams" on his hands.</p>

    <p>The content of the "dream" is exactly the feelings of those students who became "ghosts" when their bodies changed.</p>

    <p>That was the most direct impact.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it would not be a bad idea to describe these mental shocks as dreams and then return them to the organizers of school bullying.</p>

    <p>Use his way to return the favor to his body.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, every wrongdoer has his own debtor. The reason why these low-level students of Jiudaohe High School have turned into ghosts today... Among the upper-class students who have participated in school violence, not a single snowflake is innocent.</p>

    <p>So that being the case, Wang Ling plans to be a good person and do it to the end.</p>

    <p>He decided to inflict these collected painful memories on those "school bullies."</p>

    <p>Of course...it doesn't mean they turn into ghosts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not that cruel.</p>

    <p>It just gives them a nightmare.</p>

    <p>Until the bullies fully realize their mistakes and change their ways, they will experience tonight again every night. The same mental shock experienced by these ghostly students...</p>

    <p>After doing this, for Wang Ling, the whole thing is considered to have come to an end.</p>

    <p>However, the staged victory is only temporary.</p>

    <p>The one who really leads all this behind the scenes is Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, he didn't expect that the other party would have the courage to test him.</p>

    <p>Since everyone has already taken action against him...</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ling feels that the second round of warnings may begin.</p>

    <p>I didn't pull out much hair last time. But tonight, the night is still very long.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes has locked onto Jiugong Xinghui's body through the hair just now.</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter what methods Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirit use next, it will be of no avail.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter if it's "the golden cicada sheds its shell" or "the gecko cuts off its tail."</p>

    <p>Or maybe many disturbing ghosts are scattered...</p>

    <p>These are all useless in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>You can escape as you please.</p>

    <p>Escape with you to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p>So what if I run a few hundred million light years for you first...</p>

    <p>Wuzhi Mountain is Wuzhi Mountain</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jiugong Xinghui started his escape plan in a hurry.</p>

    <p>Neither she nor the demon expected that the man named "Wang Houlang" was actually the ghost that stretched out his hand to pull out his hair from the mirror!</p>

    <p>To be precise...</p>

    <p>That's not actually a ghost.</p>

    <p>But a genuine cultivator. A human being!</p>

    <p>They previously understood Wang Ling as a ghost. It was just their own wishful thinking.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>Why can a human cultivator, and also the mascot of Number 60 High School... have such terrifying strength!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui made a deal with the devil back then.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is greedy for the powerful power of ghosts.</p>

    <p>She believes that if she signs a contract with a ghost and becomes one, then her combat power will be greatly improved, even reaching a level that a normal earthly cultivator cannot match!</p>

    <p>But now Jiugong Xinghui realizes that he was wrong.</p>

    <p>There are actually monsters on this earth that are beyond her comprehension...</p>

    <p>The demon inside her is no ordinary ghost either.</p>

    <p>Rather, it is a top-level resentful spirit that has lived for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>Even the demons didn't expect that when a human being is forced to become a ghost, he can actually change back through manipulation...</p>

    <p>This is not a math problem!</p>

    <p>Can it be reversed?</p>

    <p>So. The demon spirit was stupid. Jiugong Xinghui was also stupid.</p>

    <p>They felt the students who had been corrected one after another. The expressions on their faces were so dull that they could not be described in words.</p>

    <p>Under such a severe mental shock.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirits both felt it.</p>

    <p>Their outlook on life is being reshaped and their cognition is being refreshed...</p>

    <p>Then wait until you come to your senses.</p>

    <p>One word came to the minds of one person and one ghost at the same time: escape!</p>

    <p>They can feel the huge gap between themselves and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And such a power gap obviously cannot be filled with a single {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>Keeping the green hills, you don't have to worry about having no firewood.</p>

    <p>Running away is the most important thing right now.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui originally wanted to test the reality of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the end, I didn't expect that I almost lost my life by testing it.</p>

    <p>"We can't just run away like this. We have to plan a route and then release a certain amount of interference to delay the opponent's progress." Jiugong Xinghui suggested.</p>

    <p>"I know." The demon nodded: "I have just released ten thousand ghosts. These ghosts are scattered in various directions on Sun Island. They will cause large-scale commotion. I think it should be enough to delay us."</p>

    <p>"So you've already let go..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui was stunned.</p>

    <p>At this time, she stroked her hair.</p>

    <p>Just grab it casually.</p>

    <p>A bunch of hair fell out from the top of my head...</p>

    <p>This is the effect of the demon unlocking the resting ghost.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Xinghui lost a lot of hair, his heart was bleeding.</p>

    <p>But extraordinary times. Extraordinary measures.</p>

    <p>And Jiugong Xinghui is also thinking about whether these ten thousand ghosts can really delay Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure it's okay to do this? Why do I feel unreliable?" Jiugong Xinghui questioned this.</p>

    <p>"That's ten thousand ghosts! And the ghosts we have are all carefully selected top quality... they are not that easy to deal with!"</p>

    <p>The demon said confidently: "Even if we release ten thousand pigs and let Wang Houlang catch them on Sun Island, it will take a lot of time, right? Not to mention, is it a ghost?"</p>

    <p>"I hope so." Jiugong Xinghui frowned.</p>

    <p>Next step. Her plan is actually to escape from Earth.</p>

    <p>Back then, her natal family, which is now the Akano family that represents the "Zhai Xing Group", had actually dealt with an alien creature with a silver horn on its head a long time ago.</p>

    <p>And now Zhai Xing Group is even more interdependent with this silver-horned creature. It has long been an inseparable part.</p>

    <p>Regarding the plan to escape from the alien world, Zhai Xing Group has actually always been prepared.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect this plan to be implemented today.</p>

    <p>"Let's go. We don't have much time."</p>

    <p>After calculating the last time, Jiugong Xinghui hid himself in a magic weapon the size of a grain of millet. He used it as a hiding container. It turned into a firefly-like light group and quickly left the Jiugong family's residence.</p>

    <p>At the same time, among the grains of rice, Jiugong Xinghui was also paying close attention to the handful of hair that had fallen off his head.</p>

    <p>My current hair color looks very healthy...</p>

    <p>This means that the ten thousand ghosts released by the demons are still in operation. If they are destroyed, the hair on the hands will instantly become dry and gray, losing all nutrients.</p>

    <p>According to the predictions of the devil.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to dispose of these 10,000 ghosts.</p>

    <p>It will take at least a few days of the other party's time...</p>

    <p>But the next moment, the slap in the face came too suddenly.</p>

    <p>Not long after Jiugong Xinghui escaped from Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>The bunch of black hair on my hand dried up in an instant and turned into a mass of nothingness...</p>

    <p>"This!!!" Jiugong Xinghui and the Demon Spirit both had distorted faces. Their faces were colorless.</p>

    <p>They just released ten thousand ghosts...</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, everything was cleared!</p>
