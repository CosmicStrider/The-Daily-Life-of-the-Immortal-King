  <h1>Chapter 1836 Wang Ling's warm-heartedness</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is the first time Wang Ling has encountered this kind of trust between students. In the past, he would always avoid it because he felt that it would cause trouble for himself. And to a certain extent, it would risk exposing his true strength.</p>

    <p>But now. Wang Ling really feels like he has changed. Maybe it's because he has experienced too many earth-shattering and shocking events. But when he encounters such a small commission, he has a sense of calmness that outweighs the big one.</p>

    <p>As for revealing his strength... Anyway, Sun Rong now knows his situation and will also provide him with cover. It seems that he doesn't need to worry too much.</p>

    <p>Of course. A very important aspect is that Wang Ling discovered that he is not a cold-blooded person.</p>

    <p>When wearing the Talisman Seal, his mood never fluctuated much. When he was in elementary school and junior high school, he was often insulted by people who said he was a cold-blooded animal. However, everything seemed to be different in high school.</p>

    <p>He found that he seemed to be quite nosy sometimes.</p>

    <p>Accepting this commission together with Sun Rong. Wang Ling knows very clearly that this is not because of the commission fee promised by the other party...</p>

    <p>Does he look like someone who can't walk when he hears the word instant noodles?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling didn't know why he had such a warm-hearted change, Wang Ling was in a very good mood.</p>

    <p>Because this might be the closest he gets to being a normal person.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, Lao Gudong gave a history class. The issue of conversion between spiritual stones and immortal gold was specifically mentioned.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong held the tip of the chalk and wrote a long list of conversion formulas on the blackboard. Everyone was buzzing with laughter. This was supposed to be the work of the Teacher Pan in the Talisman class. In the end, Lao Gudong did not want to give it to her.</p>

    <p>From another aspect, Lao Gudong's cultivation knowledge is indeed very extensive. In Wang Ling's view, Lao Gudong is not only capable of teaching history courses, but can also teach other courses. He is a serious person.</p>

    <p>"The above formula was something I saw when I was in High School. It's not a test question now. But if you are interested, you can memorize it."</p>

    <p>After finishing writing, Lao Gudong habitually wiped his hands stained with chalk dust with the rag on the table. Then he continued: "There are two ways to extract spiritual stones. One is to collect spiritual minerals and process them with machines. The other is created by artificially extracting spiritual energy from nature and inputting it into a machine to create spiritual stones. The created spiritual stones can then be combined with some other materials and transformed into more valuable immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"The former is more efficient. But the spiritual minerals in nature are often limited. If over-exploited, sooner or later there will be no minerals available. As for the manual input of machine to create spiritual stones, although it is inexhaustible, the efficiency is very low. On the one hand, if you engage in this kind of work for a long time, it may have a certain impact on the foundation of spiritual practice. It may even damage your spiritual roots."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has actually heard these words from Lord Diulei before.</p>

    <p>Previously, when the Tengu were still under the control of the Holy Clan, the Holy Clan also planned to let the Tengu launch a spirit stone trade war against the Huaguo Shuilian Group. As a result, before it could be implemented, the Tengu was annexed by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>At that time, Tengu planned to short the spirit stone market, causing the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception to suffer losses for no reason. And Wang Ling himself was also prepared to save the market.</p>

    <p>It's just an artificially created spiritual stone. With its output power... it can continue to output for a day. He may directly become the richest man in the world.</p>

    <p>At this time, the class was talking about the issue of artificially inputting spiritual power to create spiritual stones that may harm the body.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, Wang Ling is not worried at all. Although his output power is large, it will not have an impact on the body.</p>

    <p>"There will be no problem if you input spiritual power normally and convert it into spiritual stones. As long as you are not working continuously or working tiredly, there will be no impact. Some unscrupulous factories will continue to squeeze the labor force in order to make money."</p>

    <p>"Isn't there any prohibition in that country?" Someone raised his hand and asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"There are clear regulations on working hours for those engaged in artificial spiritual stone creation. All cultivators who are employed to input spiritual power into the machine. The daily working hours must not exceed 5 hours. Once the 5 hours are up, the shift must be changed."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong said: "This is a mandatory requirement for all regular Lingshi processing plants. If this standard is not implemented, once discovered by the regulatory authorities, the relevant companies and processing plants will be fined up to thirty times."</p>

    <p>"Teacher, you said it's formal. Are there any irregular ones?" At this time, Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"The market is so big. It is inevitable that a few fish will slip through the net. After all, as the saying goes... the most profitable projects are in the {Cultivation Criminal Law}. People, for the sake of profit, sometimes take risks. Doing some business even though you know it is against the rules, you still have to do it. In recent years, all parties have severely cracked down on illegal factories. It is also very effective."</p>

    <p>When Lao Gudong said this, he couldn't help but sigh: "Speaking of which, a few days ago I saw a satirical cartoon drawn by a famous CG cartoonist on the Internet. It was specifically aimed at those black-hearted factories..."</p>

    <p>"Wuhe Pixiu?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. That's him!"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong nodded: "But it didn't take long. This CG comic was harmonized. I don't know if it touched some people's pain points."</p>

    <p>"Then what did Teacher Wuhepixiu draw?"</p>

    <p>"This is a short comic. It tells the story of a black-hearted factory owner who uses technological means to create a large number of clone cultivators to continuously produce spiritual stones for himself."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong said with a look of reminiscence on his face: "Those poor clone cultivators have overstretched their bodies due to constant oppression. At that time, they will be abandoned by the black-hearted boss without hesitation. Their bodies will be decomposed and rebuilt. Became a new clone. Then he continued to work for the black boss. A cycle was formed."</p>

    <p>After the story was told, everyone in the class shuddered in unison.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that... this is a short comic with a hint of horror, horror and suspense. Just listening to it gives you a chilling feeling.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Teacher Wuhe Pixiu!"</p>

    <p>In the class, someone praised him.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, everyone goes to school. When they get home, they are almost faced with homework. Weekends are okay. If it is a normal working day, almost no one will pay too much attention to what is happening on the Internet.</p>

    <p>If it is deleted after being posted, it will not attract anyone's attention.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the class got into talking because of Lao Gudong's few words.</p>

    <p>But the faces of Wang Ling and Sun Rong became obviously gloomy.</p>

    <p>They always have a wonderful feeling about Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>Every time, he felt that Lao Gudong was deliberately implying something in class. But he also felt that it was just some kind of wonderful coincidence.</p>

    <p>Clone...</p>

    <p>There is also the short video blogger who looks exactly like Chen Qin and disappears out of thin air.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has an intuition that there may be some kind of connection between the two.</p>
