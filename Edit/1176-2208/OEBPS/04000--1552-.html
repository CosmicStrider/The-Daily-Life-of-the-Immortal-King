  <h1>Chapter 1552 The reason why there are so few Eternal-level experts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ying felt like they knew something terrible...</p>

    <p>I can only say that Zhang Zhui is also a talent in a certain sense.</p>

    <p>Moreover. Very lucky.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, the two of them were stunned for a long time.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I didn't expect to find anyone greener than Er Ha these days.</p>

    <p>The feelings between Dao Ancestor Wang and Old God. That is beyond doubt.</p>

    <p>Everything I saw in the secret room of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube hidden on the Heavenly Dao star. Everything left behind records the strong feelings between the two...</p>

    <p>So now that they heard Zhang Zhui talking about this matter, Wang Ling and Wang Ying felt Dao Ancestor Wang Lu's panic even more.</p>

    <p>But everything has two sides.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui still has something to say about what happened that year.</p>

    <p>"They are not married. Although it is not kind of me to do this, it is not my problem alone."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This person and the objects are still different. I have stolen so many things. Those things are dead, but the people are alive. If you don't agree, you can push me away!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled: "As long as we are not married, it is still fair competition. And it is a matter of mutual consent. Once I steal it, I will give it back."</p>

    <p>"That's sophistry." Wang Ying despises it.</p>

    <p>"Whatever you think." Zhang Zhui chuckled: "I still remember her long yellow dress and fluffy hair... What a pity. It's a cup of green tea. I also want to take this opportunity to remind Dao Ancestor. Who knows that old man Things are so ruthless"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Emotional matters are actually very complicated.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never understood these things.</p>

    <p>I'm too lazy to understand these things in detail.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when emotional matters become complicated, Wang Ling feels more troublesome than functions.</p>

    <p>It's like a circuit diagram composed of complicated wires. It's hard to figure out where to start.</p>

    <p>Therefore, without knowing the full picture, Wang Ling is too lazy to comment on these matters.</p>

    <p>He just wants to know about those eternal powerful men in this picture scroll. Does anyone know the "eternal things" he wants to know?</p>

    <p>The pile of bones in the picture below was scanned using King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Including Zhang Zhui, the average combat power of everyone in the picture has reached the "ancestral realm" as expected by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That is the combat power of a Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And if you translate that into "nucleon counts."</p>

    <p>The average person in this Corpse Map has 60 cores.</p>

    <p>"Nucleon." "Core" for short.</p>

    <p>This is the unit of measurement of combat power after the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>With the power of 1 core, it can easily destroy the planet and kill anyone in the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>Dao God. They are all just ants.</p>

    <p>The real eternal strong man is indeed so terrifying.</p>

    <p>These people are the same as Dao Ancestor Wang. They are all geniuses and arrogant people who existed when cultivation was first established.</p>

    <p>If we put it now, he would be a famous and famous giant from all ages.</p>

    <p>How can there be a place for those Dao God patriarchs in the divine realm...</p>

    <p>Looking at the Supreme Corpse Map in front of me, Wang Ling's mood is actually very complicated.</p>

    <p>Because in this universe, it turns out that there are still many eternal masters.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that they were all suppressed!</p>

    <p>And the reasons for the suppression are all bizarre.</p>

    <p>The Zhang Zhui in front of me is quite lively.</p>

    <p>The other corpses seemed to be afraid of him, so Zhang Zhui dared not come out and talk to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this is an entry point.</p>

    <p>"You were suppressed for stealing. What about the others?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui obviously knows a lot.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help laughing when he heard this: "I know a lot of gossip. But can you guys get it right? We are all bones now."</p>

    <p>"My master's pupil power can automatically complete the picture through vision. Trace back to your original appearance."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Zhang Zhui touched his chin and said.</p>

    <p>He had noticed Wang Ling's eyes before.</p>

    <p>I had some guesses in my mind, but I didn't state them directly.</p>

    <p>Seems uncertain.</p>

    <p>And some. Unspeakable.</p>

    <p>He complied with Wang Ying's question. Pointing to the other skeletons, he said, "His name is Du Junzhi. He was originally a bachelor's degree student. Because of his criticism of Dao Ancestor Wang's love affair with Old God. Because of the racial segregation system, he might not be able to give birth to a child. He was suppressed by Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>"Later, a large number of facts showed that Du Junzhi was actually right."</p>

    <p>"When I was stealing, I didn't even use an umbrella. I didn't need an umbrella."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This man's name is Zhongsun Yanshun. He was also one of my financial backers."</p>

    <p>"Financial backer?"</p>

    <p>"When I don't have a lot of money, I will just pick a few people who are rich and easy to attack. Who are they if they are not financial backers?" Zhang Zhui said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"What did he do again? Doesn't it have something to do with Old God?" Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"I heard that when I was playing chess with Dao Ancestor Wang, I secretly made a mistake while Dao Ancestor was not paying attention. I was discovered by Dao Ancestor Wang. The two had a dispute. As a result, Dao Ancestor Wang used the Corpse Map to suppress it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>According to Zhang Zhui, the relationship between Zhongsun Yanshun and Dao Ancestor Wang was actually pretty good back then.</p>

    <p>The two of them even called themselves brothers on many occasions.</p>

    <p>But sometimes the better the relationship, the more violent the quarrels will be.</p>

    <p>It's really getting to the point where there's a fight at the top. It's normal for your hands to be unsure.</p>

    <p>And after listening to Zhang Zhui say this.</p>

    <p>Whether it is Wang Ling or Wang Ying. They all have some doubts in their hearts.</p>

    <p>That's the personality of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>After you calm down, you should consider releasing the person again...</p>

    <p>However, Dao Ancestor Wang did not do that.</p>

    <p>What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p>Could it be said that this Corpse Map can only be entered, not exited?</p>

    <p>Even Dao Ancestor Wang himself doesn't know how to break the picture?</p>

    <p>The two of them were feeling suspicious.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui pointed to another person and said, "Mou Yongqi. This person was Dao Ancestor Wang's number one fan back then."</p>

    <p>"Even the fans are suppressed?" Wang Ying was startled.</p>

    <p>"I don't think we can entirely blame Dao Ancestor Wang for this matter."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui spread his hands and said with a smile: "According to modern terms, the phenomenon of cultivation fandom was actually very serious back then. There was a Hongmeng List in the ancient times. All people in the cultivation world can mark it for their favorite seniors. List. It is said that Mou Yongqi recruited soldiers and hired navy troops for Dao Ancestor Wang to reach the top of the list. He was several orders of magnitude ahead of the second place..."</p>

    <p>"Then there was a quarrel?"</p>

    <p>"Of course." Zhang Zhui said: "Some people began to scold Dao Ancestor Wang for relying on his elders to sell themselves on his status as a veteran in the world of cultivation. The scolding was extremely unpleasant. In order to maintain the image of Dao Ancestor, Mou Yongqi fought with the Confucian scholars and scolded everyone, which only caused more trouble. Dao Ancestor Wang was notorious at that time."</p>

    <p>"The image was ruined, the endorsements were withdrawn, and the reputation was also affected. Dao Ancestor Wang naturally wanted to settle the score with him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing the words. Wang Ling and Wang Ying were both silent.</p>

    <p>What a cruel fact...</p>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling is sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>The reason why there are so few foreigners is because they often challenge extreme sports to death.</p>

    <p>The reason why there are so few powerful people at the Eternal level. The reason why I dare to love is because I offended Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone who was suppressed who didn't offend Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>"Of course there are."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "Here! This man's name is Sheng Jinyang... He has nothing to do with Dao Ancestor Wang. It's just that he made a bet with Dao Ancestor Wang that he had a way to enter the Corpse Map and come out."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Then. There is no more."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
