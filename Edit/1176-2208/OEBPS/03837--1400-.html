  <h1>Chapter 1400 The meaning of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiandu has a strong cultural and historical atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Just like those ancient towns that were left behind on earth. They still maintain the simple style of the old era.</p>

    <p>With the progress of modernization, the ancient buildings left by our predecessors are decreasing year by year. They are demolished and renovated. High-rise buildings made of reinforced concrete are gradually replacing history.</p>

    <p>So Songhai City, where Wang Ling and Sun Rong and others live, is quite special.</p>

    <p>In such a first-tier city, the architectural style is indeed a rare mix of ancient and modern styles.</p>

    <p>So when we came to Jiandu Ancient Street, the girl didn't feel any discomfort at all.</p>

    <p>There are many ancient streets like this in Songhai City. Sun Rong has always wanted to find time to make an appointment with Wang Ling to take a look.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong softly hummed the melody of a popular song. Although he didn't sing the words, Bai Qiao guessed the title of the song right away.</p>

    <p>Li Ronghao's old street.</p>

    <p>Walking on such a street, there is a song like this that really suits the occasion.</p>

    <p>"Back then, the Sword King Realm was in chaos. There was no such civilization and order at all. Although the Sword Spirit was born from the universe, it was just a "spirit" at the beginning. It was Dao Ancestor Wang who brought human civilization here and made it here. Named "Sword King Realm." Then, "spirit" became "Sword Spirit"." On the way to the Sword Capital Palace, Wu Jin said.</p>

    <p>"So the reason why Sword Spirit is now in human form is largely because Dao Ancestor Wang brought human civilization?" asked Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"That's right. But not all sword spirits are humanoid. There are also a small number of alien sword spirits. Their appearance is all kinds of strange. They are animals, plants, and some even look like alien creatures."</p>

    <p>Wu Jin said: "However, these appearances are actually not fixed. As long as the cultivation level is sufficient, the sword spirit can freely decide its own appearance."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Man smiled and said: "For example, Carter. She looked like a garlicky tortoise at first."</p>

    <p>"Garlic Bastard"</p>

    <p>"It's Bulbasaur."</p>

    <p>"If it weren't for her loyalty to Master Bai Qiao, she might not have changed into a human form."</p>

    <p>After Lao Man finished speaking, Sun Rong glanced at Carter. The woman in front of him saw the dark history mentioned by Wu Jin. The expression on her face was completely unmoved. She did not take what Lao Man said to heart at all.</p>

    <p>This is a "three-no-girl."</p>

    <p>In a sense, it is somewhat similar to Wang Ling. Instead, Sun Rong feels an inexplicable sense of intimacy?</p>

    <p>The inner world of people with facial paralysis may be similar.</p>

    <p>Therefore, communicating more with facial paralysis will help increase your experience in communicating with people with the same type of facial paralysis.</p>

    <p>When passing by a sword hall, Sun Rong suddenly thought of a question: "By the way, can I buy swords in the Sword King Realm?"</p>

    <p>This question is actually an idea of Sun Rong. In order to deal with the groundhog before, Ah Nuan made great efforts. For this, the girl has always been grateful.</p>

    <p>This is a huge favor. Sun Rong has been thinking of how to repay it.</p>

    <p>Now that she finally came to the Sword King Realm, she wondered if she could help Ah Nuan, who was not yet born, choose a spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong calculated the time.</p>

    <p>There is still more than half a month until December 30th.</p>

    <p>The due date is approaching. If you can help Ah Nuan find a suitable spiritual sword, you can pay any price.</p>

    <p>Wu Jin: "What Miss Sun saw was a mercenary sword hall in the Sword King Realm. Generally, sword spirits can be openly hired to protect personal safety. The hiring parties include cultivators. There are also sword spirits from other Sword King Realms."</p>

    <p>"Sword Spirit hires Sword Spirit?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The Sword King Realm is rich in mineral resources. If you can get rare ores, you can upgrade the sword body. This will increase the success rate of breaking through the Blade Storm."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Wu Jin frowned: "As for buying swords, the currency of the human world is not valuable in the Sword King Realm. So the best way is to exchange items with equal value. As long as an agreement is reached, there will be sword spirits willing to sign the contract."</p>

    <p>Wu Jin finished speaking. Bai Qiao added from the side: "There are very few cultivators who have the strength to enter the Sword King Realm. Signing a Sword Spirit Contract is usually based on the consent of both parties."</p>

    <p>"Of course. If you really see the right eye.</p>

    <p>We don't rule out the possibility of signing an agreement without paying any money."</p>

    <p>"To put it simply, although the Lord's sister has not yet been born, you must have seen her strength. If she comes to the Sword King Realm in person when she grows up, there must be sword spirits who are willing to follow her wholeheartedly without taking any money."</p>

    <p>"Now, her name is not that famous after all. If you want to find a spiritual sword for her in advance, the price will probably be high."</p>

    <p>The price Bai Qiao mentioned refers to the price paid by Sun Rong for not relying on "Wang Ling's face."</p>

    <p>Otherwise, given her and Jingke's status in the sword king world, if she shouted in the street, countless sword spirits would be willing to come for an interview. They would be Wang Nuan's spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>But this would be meaningless.</p>

    <p>She could tell that the girl wanted to rely on her own strength to choose a spiritual sword for Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. This is not the earth. When currency is not circulating, the conditions for "buying a sword" actually do not hold true at all.</p>

    <p>Even if it is deducted from items. The most valuable item that Sun Rong can get is probably the Aohai in his hand.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to sell Aohai to exchange for Wang Nuan's sword.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Bai Qiao's words also made Sun Rong fall into deep thought for a short time.</p>

    <p>"I remember that the Sword Conference is two days later. If I can win the game, can I be rewarded with a piece of Jian Shen alloy? If I have the alloy as a bargaining chip, I think most sword spirits in the Sword King world will want to come for an interview."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Man spoke and pointed out a clear path to the helpless girl.</p>

    <p>But as soon as he said these words, Wu Jin beside him was stunned for a moment. Then he slapped his head: "Oh, yes! I remember. There seems to be such a Sword Conference. I will also attend!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Wu Jin quickly pushed Carter next to him with his elbow.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Carter nodded and said, "Well, there is a Sword Conference."</p>

    <p>"Is this happening, right? I think this is a good opportunity, Miss Sun!"</p>

    <p>Lao Man quickly followed Carter's words and continued: "If you can get this piece of Jian Shen alloy, you can choose a sword for Nuan Zhenren! By then, the sword spirits who come for the interview will probably be ranked from the sword capital. Sea of Swords."</p>

    <p>"I'm participating!!!" Sun Rong said seriously, "But how do I sign up?"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. We can just do the registration for Miss Sun." Lao Man said, patting his chest.</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much to the three seniors!" Sun Rong said with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>"After hearing this, Bai Qiao finally couldn't help but twitch the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>I think these three people acted a little too much.</p>

    <p>What a Sword Conference!</p>

    <p>If there really is this Sword Conference. How could she not know?!</p>

    <p>In order to show courtesy to the girl. Is it okay to hold a Sword conference directly in the void?</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao was not in a hurry to reveal it.</p>

    <p>She wanted to see how the three of them wanted to end it.</p>
