  <h1>Chapter 2036 Five% Law Order Palm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: 5% Law and Order Palm. This is based on the spiritual power of Wang Ling's ordinary palm. It is a special move that can directly crush the enemy into powder with one blow.</p>

    <p>The moment the red light cannon was fired, Sun Yiyuan already had visions. He felt that what was shot from Wang Ling's palm was not an ordinary spiritual cannon.</p>

    <p>Rather, it is a dragon that has spanned eternity, witnessed the rise and fall of the universe, and was born from the most blazing stars...</p>

    <p>It only fused 5% of Wang Ling's spiritual power in the sealed state. But its destructive power was astonishing.</p>

    <p>The ice purgatory of the Sun family was directly changed by Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>All the glaciers under my feet melted due to this palm. Water vapor was steaming everywhere.</p>

    <p>Countless icebergs around were melted instantly. A large amount of glacier water gathered into a torrent. It poured down the cliff along the abyss created by Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself did not expect that he could bring such great damage to the Ice Purgatory in the ancestral land of the Sun family by using only 5% of the spiritual power in the sealed state to form the Law Palm.</p>

    <p>Looking at the abyss in front of him that seemed to have been crushed by a giant dragon. Wang Ling felt a little overwhelmed for a moment.</p>

    <p>Although he is not good at repairing the terrain himself, he is not very good at it. If he were to repair the destroyed map in front of him, not only would he not be able to restore the original appearance of the Ice Purgatory, the ancestral land of the Sun family, he might even be able to directly repair it. Fix more bugs.</p>

    <p>There are enough troubles on the earth now. Wang Ling is afraid that his cultivation will add some miracles in the history of cultivation to the ancestral land of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling had already anticipated this situation.</p>

    <p>At critical moments like this, key people have to take action. For example, Zhenyuan Immortal combined with Lord Diulei is a very good combination.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal people have experience in repairing planets. As a descendant of the innate divine thunder, Lord Diulei is essentially an "electric welder." With these two people here, I believe that this ice purgatory can be restored in a short time. The original appearance is not that difficult.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, Wang Ling is quite embarrassed to have turned the Sun family's ancestral land into this.</p>

    <p>I was about to turn around and apologize to Boss Sun. But Wang Ling found that Boss Sun had already laid down and soaked in the water.</p>

    <p>There is a feeling of walking peacefully on a bright moonlit night. Mr. Boss Sun also walks peacefully.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, his direct attack had a huge impact on Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Even if you are in the True Immortal realm, it is normal for you to be overwhelmed by the scene in front of you.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Sun family's ancestral land was so virtuous due to his slap. I'm afraid this is even more unacceptable to Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently. Then he raised his hand again. He helped Mr. Boss Sun aside. Then he drew a teleportation circle on the ground. The people who had been arranged in advance were directly teleported here using the circle.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked confused: "What happened? Grandpa is okay!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying manifested his body. He crossed his arms and said, "Don't worry. Mr. Boss Sun was just frightened. The Lord has already replaced his memory. Once Mr. Boss Sun wakes up normally, he will be fine."</p>

    <p>"What is this place?"</p>

    <p>"It's a space that passes through a different world."</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that my Sun family's ancestral land would be so special. There would be such a huge steam abyss."</p>

    <p>"No, Miss Rong. This steam abyss was created by the command master's powerful palm." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Before you came, this place was originally an ice purgatory. It was a serious glacier world."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was afraid of his head. The expression on his face was that he couldn't laugh or cry: "I know now why grandpa fainted..."</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong didn't mean to blame Wang Ling. After all, it essentially destroyed Mingyue Ye. In fact, it was to protect Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>Understand this truth. Of course Sun Rong will not care about this many things. She just looked at the young man in front of her tenderly and asked: "Then classmate Wang Ling. will be responsible for repairing it, right?"</p>

    <p>Gu "Hmm..." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren has notified Zhenyuan Immortal and Dharma King. They are on their way here." Immortal Toya looked at the abyss in front of him. He couldn't help but smiled bitterly and said, "I'll keep this teleportation circle for now." It's fine here. They will be teleported directly here by the magic circle when they turn around."</p>

    <p>"That's it. I'll stay here to take care of grandpa. Immortal Toya-senpai and his classmate Wang Ling will continue to go deep into the ancestral land. Don't you still have something you want to know?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly suggested: "Grandpa hasn't woken up yet. It's a good time. It's convenient for me to stay and take care of him. In addition, it can also guide the way for Senior Zhenyuan Immortal and Senior Dharma King."</p>

    <p>"That's fine. Miss Rong's suggestion is completely feasible."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya bowed and said with a smile: "Miss Rong, please rest assured. Next, I will accompany Ling Zhenren in depth. I will definitely remind Ling Zhenren to restrain himself and avoid using too much force again to cause irreversible damage to the Sun family's ancestral land."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also stood up and bowed: "Then I'll trouble Immortal Toya-senpai."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To be honest. Boss Sun was so shocked that he fainted. This was not what Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun's memories are all going to be replaced anyway. So after that slap, Wang Ling had already prepared the words to show off to Boss Sun. But he didn't expect that he had been brewing for a long time. As a result, the old man fainted himself.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, after a comprehensive examination by Immortal Toya, Mr. Boss Sun only fainted due to a huge shock to his soul and temporary high blood pressure.</p>

    <p>As a strong person in the True Immortal realm, this physical reaction is not life-threatening.</p>

    <p>However, this does give Wang Ling the opportunity to go deep into the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>The palm he just struck destroyed the Ice Purgatory, but the movement was definitely not small.</p>

    <p>This is actually Wang Ling trying to verify his own ideas. Under such a huge movement, the person who has been hiding in the Sun family's ancestral land and sitting firmly behind the scenes may really be unable to sit still and surface directly.</p>

    <p>Although the Sun family's ancestral land seems peaceful on the surface, Wang Ling has a hunch that as long as he goes deeper, he might actually be able to meet the Sun family's ancestor.</p>

    <p>It's just that when that time comes, it's really not certain whether the founder of the Sun family is still the original ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling moved his mind and transferred Immortal Toya directly to his core world.</p>

    <p>He had a feeling that the next journey would be very dangerous. Even if Immortal Toya was the descendant of Laojun, there was no guarantee that he would encounter any accidents in the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>So he must protect Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>We can only take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>Talk about Jian. Wang Ling flies into the void. It turns into a golden light and ascends to the void. www.uukanshu.net Speeds along the abyss in front of you.</p>

    <p>Just two hundred kilometers ahead, King's Eyes of Wang Ling saw an old stone gate embedded in the cliffside. Water vapor condensed on it. There were water drops hanging on the entire stone gate.</p>

    <p>Obviously before the 5% Law Palm was played, this place was also frozen.</p>

    <p>So. Is it the entrance to the next map?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly. Then he touched the handle of the stone door.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the nearby space began to vibrate.</p>

    <p>Countless golden teleportation arrays lit up in the void.</p>

    <p>A noble knight riding a stone horse rushed out of the magic circle. They were armed with various weapons. In just a short moment, they charged towards Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, Immortal Toya sighed: "It's broken. Ling Zhenren. There is no Boss Sun with us. We are defined as intruders!"</p>
