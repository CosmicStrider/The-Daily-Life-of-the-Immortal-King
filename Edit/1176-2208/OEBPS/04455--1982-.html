  <h1>Chapter 1982 Urban legends about the spiritual world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Today's Wang Ling is very abnormal. Anyone with a discerning eye can actually see it.</p>

    <p>Of course. The reason why Wang Ling suddenly became proactive is still unknown. So just after the first class this morning. The urban legend about Wang Ling being snatched away in the spirit world trial ground was like that. It's spreading...</p>

    <p>"Oh my god, is the spiritual world trial field so scary? I heard that the student surnamed Wang in Class 3 of Grade 1 is possessed by another body."</p>

    <p>"The one with the surname Wang? Is he the legendary mascot of our sixty?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! That's him! I heard that he had never answered questions so actively in class before. He lived a very low-key life. As a result, he seemed to be a different person when he came back from the spirit world... They said this is a body snatching. His personality has changed!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, and Liu Qingyi listened to the discussion of the others in the class. They looked at each other for a moment. They suddenly felt the seriousness of this problem.</p>

    <p>Of course, they also know very well. The theory of seizing the body is just nonsense. No one in this world can seize the body of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, a cultivator wants to seize the body. The first thing to do is the soul battle.</p>

    <p>The last creature that entered Wang Ling's soul was frightened by the vast universe. Facing this incomparably bright universe and the Milky Way, that creature had no idea where to start.</p>

    <p>This is still under the condition that Wang Ling deliberately let it in to let it in. Under normal circumstances, it is undoubtedly difficult to penetrate into Wang Ling's soul.</p>

    <p>So, after putting aside all these external factors, it seems easier to analyze the remaining situations that can lead to a drastic change in Wang Ling's temperament.</p>

    <p>"Talisman..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing quickly thought of the problem and took the initiative to communicate with Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi using voice transmission.</p>

    <p>He reacted extremely quickly, because apart from this, he really couldn't think of any other reason.</p>

    <p>When Fang Xing said this, Wang Zhen suddenly recalled it. He quickly replied: "Yes. I remembered it. Mr. Shou Chong seems to be working with Mr. Wang Ming on Ling Zhenren's new Talisman... I see Eighty percent probability this time, it was the new Talisman that caused this problem."</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a serious bug in the new version of Talisman. The old Talisman can not only seal strength. It can also affect personal emotions.</p>

    <p>As for the new Talisman, Wang Ming has made adjustments to the intensity of blocking emotions. But this adjustment is too drastic. It not only allows Wang Ling to open up emotions, but also makes Wang Ling's personality like he's become a different person.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fang Xing and others were not the only ones who were anxious. In fact, Sun Rong also thought of this reason.</p>

    <p>She hurried to the student union office as soon as class was over. She used this quiet place to contact Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming! Something big has happened! Classmate Wang Ling... has become so strange!" Sun Rong called.</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, Wang Ming seemed to have anticipated this incident. He looked like he was in control: "Has his personality changed? Is he more cheerful than before?"</p>

    <p>"It's more than cheerful... it's simply unrestrained!" Sun Rong held her forehead.</p>

    <p>Although she still likes Wang Ling very much. However, Wang Ling's drastic change in personality still makes her feel something strange... It won't be easy for her to get used to it.</p>

    <p>The key is that Wang Ling likes to express himself too much. If left unchecked, something big might happen.</p>

    <p>"It seems to be a bug in the new Talisman."</p>

    <p>"Is this because you have completely unleashed your emotional suppression? That's why it's like this. Brother Ming?"</p>

    <p>"Not really." Wang Ming said: "I have been monitoring the data remotely. Judging from the current results, Ling Ling should be imitating."</p>

    <p>"imitate?"</p>

    <p>"The past Talisman suppressed his true strength and real emotions. So even if he replaced the new version of Talisman, his understanding of emotions and emotions is still very limited. It is easiest when he does not know the joy, anger, sorrow, and joy. What happens is synchronous imitation."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "You know that Li Changzhe. He is quite noisy. He was in the spirit world training ground before. Ling Ling was in a group with him."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Hearing this, Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>The implication is that Wang Ling's character, emotions, and emotional expression are completely assimilated with that Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is an important experimental result for Wang Ming. In the subsequent development of Talisman, mistakes can be avoided based on the current problems.</p>

    <p>As a rigorous scientist, Wang Ming certainly had a backup plan for this matter. Therefore, last night he asked Zhai Yin to prepare the regular seal Talisman.</p>

    <p>"So just replace it with regular Talisman. Wang Ling and he'll be back to normal."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied: "But Rongrong. In fact, this is a rare and good opportunity."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Eh? What a good opportunity? What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, Wang Ming smiled calmly: "In the past, you never got a response to your feelings. Now you can express your feelings to Ling Ling. Maybe you can get a direct reply."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face immediately turned red.</p>

    <p>To be honest, as Wang Ming said, this is a rare opportunity... If she confess her love again, she might actually get a response from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, under normal circumstances, she doesn't know if she would have to wait until the Year of the Monkey to let this idiot take the initiative to say that he likes her.</p>

    <p>She knew it.</p>

    <p>However, the girl at this moment didn't want to do that.</p>

    <p>After being silent for a long time. After cooling down her emotions a little, Sun Rong responded calmly: "Then, forget it..."</p>

    <p>"Why?" Wang Ming was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Because this is weird..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled and said: "I clearly know that Wang Ling is now in sync with Li Changzhe's personality. I also took this opportunity to confess to him. So is the person who responds to my feelings my classmate Wang Ling or classmate Li?"</p>

    <p>"Although... there is nothing wrong with classmate Wang Ling being cheerful. But I hope that one day, he can grow up on his own and realize his own feelings like a man..."</p>

    <p>"Until then, I'd rather he be a piece of wood..."</p>

    <p>"All right."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming heard this. He nodded repeatedly and said with a smile: "We'll see. The regular Talisman is on Ling Ling himself. Just find him to complete the replacement."</p>

    <p>"Ok. Thank you, Brother Ming."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She breathed a sigh of relief while hanging up the phone.</p>

    <p>Not bad. Not bad...</p>

    <p>That is not the real character of classmate Wang Ling. It is just a phenomenon caused by imitating others.</p>

    <p>As long as she reminds Wang Ling now to replace the Talisman.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, an accident happened again. Chen Chao and Guo Hao almost broke into the student union office.</p>

    <p>"Something bad has happened, Boss Sun..." Guo Hao panted.</p>

    <p>"What happened? Speak slowly?"</p>

    <p>"It's Shengke! Shengke has given us a sixty round challenge!"</p>

    <p>"It is a normal challenge and competition between the two schools. It needs to be approved by the principal. It is illegal for them to send invitations separately. It can be ignored."</p>

    <p>"That's true. But the person who issued the challenge is none other than Dai Tianchun, the principal of Shengke!"</p>

    <p>"Principal Dai... come in person?" Sun Rong understood instantly.</p>

    <p>Rumor has it that Principal Dai, who is known as Crazy Dai, is a famous calf protector...</p>

    <p>He spent countless resources building up Qu Shuling, making him an outstanding representative among high school cultivators. As a result, a spiritual world trial directly defeated Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Obviously, this is not an acceptable result for Principal Dai.</p>

    <p>"Where's Principal Chen?"</p>

    <p>"Principal Chen is not here... Teacher Wang Zukang went to hold an academic affairs meeting with him."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao said: "Of course. The crux of the problem is actually not here..."</p>

    <p>He and Guo Hao sang and harmonized. The two of them seemed to be taking each other's lines.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "The key to the problem is! Wang Ling he... accepted the challenge!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>
