  <h1>Chapter 1587 The Secret of King's Eyes</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>That is, although Ah Nuan girl and I were both born from the same mother's womb, Ah Nuan girl's taste in food is really completely different from mine.</p>

    <p>Why do you always stare at strange-looking things?</p>

    <p>And don't know why.</p>

    <p>He felt that Ah Nuan girl had just eaten the tentacles of the final hunter.</p>

    <p>The body seems to be larger than before.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan looked like he had vomited the piece of tentacle meat, but he actually ate part of it.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl still has her own picky pursuit of meat quality.</p>

    <p>The part that was spit out is the older one.</p>

    <p>The war was about to begin. She knew very well that her pitiful and thin body needed to replenish energy in time.</p>

    <p>Who made her just a weak baby girl?</p>

    <p>At the same time, it is also to ensure that she will not continue to become a weak woman when she grows up. Ah Nuan girl suddenly realized a new skill.</p>

    <p>That is... taking supplements!</p>

    <p>I remember that when Mother Wang was pregnant with her, she took all kinds of supplements and highly nutritious food.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Ah Nuan girl is now labeled as a "foodie."</p>

    <p>In fact, there is also an element of prenatal education from Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>When Wang Nuan's eyes focused on Fenmu Shen's huge piece of meat in front of him that was emitting the light of resurrection, Fenmu Shen seemed to be aware of some danger.</p>

    <p>Although Fenmu Shen is just a huge lump of meat now, he is actually intelligent.</p>

    <p>This piece of meat is actually an embryo of an alien god!</p>

    <p>Outer God!</p>

    <p>This is the most powerful lineage among the Old Dominators in the ancient universe!</p>

    <p>In Wang Nuan's eyes, the golden light was like salted egg yolk. It was a signal of recovery. It flashed repeatedly on Fenmu Shen's huge body at a heartbeat-like frequency.</p>

    <p>It looked like a kind of holy light. Especially against the backdrop of this dark and boundless supreme world. Fenmu Shen's existence was simply like a miracle.</p>

    <p>Everyone who watched this scene was shocked by the scene before them.</p>

    <p>"It has far exceeded the height of human cultivators..." Even the monk saw the ancient universe for the first time. The scene of the resurrection of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>During his thousands of reincarnations, he believed that he had insight into the eternity. He had already seen through countless scenes. However, this was the first time he saw the resurrection of an external god before him.</p>

    <p>"He's coming to life." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>This is a very special kind of fluctuation. It seems to be sending a signal of dominance to the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Due to the particularity of the signal, people in lower realms often cannot receive this kind of gratitude. However, the transmission of signal fluctuations will indirectly affect their mood, work status, and even cause weight gain, insomnia, and the possibility of depression...</p>

    <p>However, such special signal fluctuations can be clearly felt by the powerful beings in the universe.</p>

    <p>"Is he showing off his power..." The monk was frightened.</p>

    <p>Because apart from the first time he faced Wang Ling, this was already the second time that it made him feel flustered.</p>

    <p>The most dignified Buddhist sages could not help but feel turbulent. There was no need to say more about the rest.</p>

    <p>At this moment, countless people in the universe raised their heads and stared in the direction of the supreme world that had been engulfed by chaos.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the heroes changed their colors.</p>

    <p>God RealmÂ·Heavenly Dao Star, God Realm, Demon Realm...as well as those explored civilizations and unexplored unknown civilizations in the universe. The high-ranking and powerful people among all living beings all have a feeling of difficulty breathing.</p>

    <p>They couldn't tell what this force was, let alone whether it represented evil or justice.</p>

    <p>But this painful feeling of being strangled by the throat makes everyone feel that the universe is about to be in chaos.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that a powerful creature from the ancient universe was about to resurrect!</p>

    <p>And still.</p>

    <p>The strongest creature in the Old Dominator - the Outer God!</p>

    <p>The next moment, almost all planetary civilizations that received this signal opened their own defensive barriers. They didn't know if this shallow barrier really worked.</p>

    <p>But at least it can provide them with some psychological comfort.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Wang siblings. Wang Ling and Wang Nuan. are in the chaotic storm of the supreme world.</p>

    <p>A huge piece of flesh that shines with golden light. It is terrifying and frightening. It has a bit of a sofa atmosphere in its holiness. Countless nameless fogs are generated from the surroundings. It seems to be connected to every corner of the universe.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand and slapped him. He used his ordinary palm power to create a hurricane and hit these nameless fogs.</p>

    <p>After the nameless fog was lifted away, it was regenerated in a seamless manner.</p>

    <p>There is only a little time left before Fenmu Shen is officially resurrected.</p>

    <p>"die..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling heard the vicissitudes of Fenmu Shen's voice filled with murderous energy coming from the huge golden mass. It echoed throughout the entire supreme world, clanking and ringing.</p>

    <p>A huge ancient shrine was born like a mirage. It seemed that it appeared here in response to the call of Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>This ancient temple seems to be nothingness, but also seems to exist in real life. Every ancient pillar and wall is carved with obscure runes to remember. It fills the sky and the earth, exuding a breathtaking brilliance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rolled up his sleeves. He wanted to smash the shrine to pieces with one punch. But at this moment, he used King's Eyes to see that there was a three-petal Golden Lotus with tentacles as rhizomes inside the ancient shrine.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling's thoughts of smashing the ancient shrine to pieces with one punch instantly dissipate.</p>

    <p>Because this three-petal Golden Lotus seems to be closely related to his King's Eyes. Whenever he releases his power, there is such a three-petal Golden Lotus blooming in his pupils.</p>

    <p>But from the appearance, there are some subtle differences between the Golden Lotus in the ancient temple and the one shown in King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Can we just go in and take a look...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has been exploring King's Eyes for years. It was only after a long time that he found a possible clue to the problem. So he didn't want to give up so easily.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan. Sorry.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling reached out and rubbed his sister's head.</p>

    <p>Exploring the Ancient Shrine will undoubtedly take time. This means Ah Nuan may have to be hungry for a while longer.</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, Wang Ling selected a few of the unconscious Endgame hunters on the ground that looked the tenderest and put them into King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>What if there is seasoning in the ancient shrine...</p>

    <p>Maybe the final hunter will taste better.</p>

    <p>"Palace of the Outer Gods..." At this moment, through the swastika, Monk Jin Deng also saw this horrifying scene.</p>

    <p>Back then, he had seen a similar building from Dao Ancestor Wang's published notes, so he recalled it after observing it for a while.</p>

    <p>"What is Ling Zhenren doing... You must not go in! It's too dangerous!" The expression on his face changed drastically. He was filled with surprise.</p>

    <p>Because it was written in the notes of Dao Ancestor Wang that year.</p>

    <p>Palace of Outer Gods...</p>

    <p>That is a place from which there is no return.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang once sent several real clones to explore the Palace of the Outer Gods. However, none of them came back. All were lost in the palace!</p>

    <p>This is an existence even more terrifying than the highest world!</p>

    <p>It's the same as walking into someone else's rules!</p>

    <p>And the most terrifying thing is that the Palace of the Outer Gods at this moment is in the highest world. If Wang Ling walks inside... it is equivalent to being double shackled!</p>

    <p>The monk has never dealt with creatures from the ancient universe. But when the monk sensed that palpitating aura for the second time since the last battle with Wang Ling... Monk Jin Deng was already aware of it. The situation in front of me is very bad.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fenmu Shen did not expect that the young man in front of him would take the initiative to enter his outer god's palace.</p>

    <p>The highest world + the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>This combination was extremely stressful. He didn't know if Wang Ling was stupid. He actually walked into the "cage" he had arranged.</p>

    <p>And he just came in by himself. He even brought his sister in with him.</p>

    <p>But in this way, Fenmu Shen felt that it saved him a lot of trouble.</p>

    <p>Ha. What two interesting little guys...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen, who is about to take shape and completely evolve into an outer god, feels that he has the power to understand everything in the universe.</p>

    <p>He stared at the brother and sister who entered the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling entered the main entrance, the palace door was firmly sealed and locked!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And until this moment, Fenmu Shen never thought about it.</p>

    <p>Just now.</p>

    <p>A demolition team was put in...</p>
