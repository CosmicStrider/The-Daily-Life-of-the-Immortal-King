  <h1>Chapter 1880 The long-planned usurper</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are actually two books of the Nine Realms existing in this world of cultivation at the same time...</p>

    <p>Whether it was Zhang Zhui who was witnessing it directly or Wang Ling who was peeking at the screen in the next room, everyone was slightly stunned.</p>

    <p>"Dao Ancestor Wang... designed two books from the beginning?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>"In the beginning, there was really only one copy." Mrs. Shanxiu frowned and said, "Do you still remember the bowl of all things that was first sold at the auction? It is a magic weapon of chaos that can reproduce any object."</p>

    <p>"So it's that bowl... that's not right. That bowl is far from that powerful. It's just a replica of the elixir Talisman. How could it be possible to even replicate the Book of Nine Realms." Zhang Zhui was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"It is a magic weapon that has the same function as that bowl. And this magic weapon, as far as I know, should be an object from the palace of the outer gods. It is related to the old world." These words once again shocked everyone in the audience.</p>

    <p>Regarding things about the old world, perhaps few modern cultivators know about or touch that world. However, this is a common topic among cultivators throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>Human beings are creatures full of curiosity. They will never stop tracing and exploring past civilizations.</p>

    <p>This is a never-ending cycle.</p>

    <p>If it were in the heyday of the old days, these Old Dominators led by outer gods would inevitably trace the origin of the universe.</p>

    <p>Although they are a magnificent race in the past history of the universe, Wang Ling is certain that they are definitely not the origin of the universe.</p>

    <p>In the vast universe, various mysterious species emerge one after another. The old world, the world of dragons, and the current world of cultivators built by humans are just a drop in the ocean in the vast universe.</p>

    <p>"The Book of Nine Realms that Madam is holding now, is it a Yin Volume or a Yang Volume?" Zhang Zhui was already a little confused. He opened his eyes and asked.</p>

    <p>"It's a Yin scroll." Shan Xiufu said: "If you use your spiritual sense to feel it carefully, you should be able to realize that it is surrounded by some extraordinary energy that does not belong to cultivators."</p>

    <p>"But I still can't figure it out. Why did that man attack King Tiankun?" Zhang Zhui frowned.</p>

    <p>"Because this Yin scroll of the Book of Nine Realms originally belonged to King Tiankun."</p>

    <p>"ah?"</p>

    <p>"Moreover. This is what King Tiankun entrusted the thief named Zhang Zhui to give to me."</p>

    <p>"ah???"</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with this brother? Why do you feel so surprised?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui wiped his cold sweat and tried to regain his composure. At the same time, he also began to recall the past events that spanned a long time.</p>

    <p>He seemed to vaguely remember such a thing. But if Mrs. Shanxiu hadn't mentioned it at this moment, he might never have been able to remember it in his life.</p>

    <p>"Do you still remember that Zhang Zhui stole the Immortal Stone in front of everyone at the auction? That's when the commission from King Tiankun started."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu said: "Therefore, the Immortal Stone is just a bait. King Tiankun originally planned to hand it over from the beginning. This was originally the reward paid to Zhang Zhui. But the real purpose. He really wanted to hand over this book of Nine Realms. The dark scroll of the book was transferred to the old body."</p>

    <p>The topic has reached this point. Everyone around is shocked.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the truth of the matter would be like this...</p>

    <p>On the surface, King Tiankun went to the auction with such majesty. He guarded the Immortal Stone and threatened to capture Zhang Zhui... All the actions behind this were actually to transfer the dark scroll of the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Ren held his chin and couldn't help but speak: "So, King Tiankun's real purpose was actually to ask the Lady to protect the Yin Scroll of the Book of the Nine Realms, and he also knew that he was being watched from the very beginning?"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu seemed a little surprised by the accuracy of Chen Ren's guess. After being stunned for a moment, she nodded to herself: "Brother Chen Ren is absolutely right..."</p>

    <p>"But what was the purpose of his snatching the scrolls from the gentleman in Room 1 at the auction?" Sun Fu asked.</p>

    <p>"Because under normal circumstances, the reproduced items cannot surpass the original ones. But because this Yin Scroll is blessed by the power of the old world, it is surrounded by a mysterious force. In this way, the situation is different from what we imagined."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu eloquently said: "The Yin Scroll has more terrifying power than the Yang Scroll. Not only can it inherit the Taoist tradition of Dao Ancestor Wang, but it will also gain power from the old world... As far as I know, there are no restrictions on this replica of the Yin scroll. No matter who opens it, they can read the words inside."</p>

    <p>"Could this be... a recovery plan from the old world?" Zhang Zhui boldly hypothesized.</p>

    <p>"Yes. This recovery plan is very dangerous. And King Tiankun has obviously guessed this, so he started to make plans."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu said: "This Yin Scroll is just a replica after all. As long as King Tiankun can successfully get the Yang Scroll, he can offset part of the power in the Yin Scroll. Then he can gather his strength to destroy it... But it's a pity. He has never bid for your master."</p>

    <p>"So he had no choice but to change his plan. He could only seize the Yang Scroll by force. However, he did not expect that he would be plotted by a third party during the battle."</p>

    <p>"So, his death really has nothing to do with my master?"</p>

    <p>"It's not that it has nothing to do with it... But I can't blame you all for this matter. After all, King Tiankun seems to be planning to digest this matter himself. And I came to this conclusion based on some clues and evidence currently available. made some inferences."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu sighed and said: "The moment King Tiankun was destroyed into ashes, nothing was left behind. Don't you feel strange?"</p>

    <p>"It is indeed very strange." Zhang Zhui nodded: "If a normal cultivator dies, it will not be so clean. King Tiankun evaporates instantly and disappears in an instant. Such a method... is very unnatural."</p>

    <p>"Because the moment the third-party force got rid of him, they also took away all the magic weapons that could be stored in him. From the beginning, they came here for the dark scroll of the Book of Nine Realms."</p>

    <p>After everyone listened to the entire inference, they couldn't help but have mixed feelings in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Although Mrs. Shanxiu also came to the conclusion based on the clues that she has mastered so far. It can be seen that Mrs. Shanxiu's status in the current world of cultivation. The credibility of what she said is very high.</p>

    <p>And this inference is also a very reasonable one. It also explains a lot of things that Wang Ling had not figured out before.</p>

    <p>So now the question arises. Who is this third party...</p>

    <p>In fact, at this moment, Wang Ling vaguely had the answer in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Since Madam has said so much, she should also know something about this third party." At this time, Zhang Zhui asked seriously.</p>

    <p>"It's just a guess. Not sure."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu shook her head slightly and said: "This person's influence spreads all over the Central Region and the Four Major Regions. It is a new force that has flourished in the past hundred years. And through the dispute between the East and West Regions, he has made a lot of money. He has a lot of background. Very strong..."</p>

    <p>"Could it be..." Zhang Zhui suddenly remembered something.</p>

    <p>"Yes. This force's general surname is: Peng."</p>
