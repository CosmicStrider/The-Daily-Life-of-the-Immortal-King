  <h1>Chapter 1403: Spiritual Sword Worthy of Wang Nuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After giving away the Heavenly Dao durian, Wang Ling felt a lot better.</p>

    <p>Whether Wang Zhen's knee is broken or not, it has nothing to do with him... This is the so-called tit-for-tat. Sooner or later, you will have to pay back the money.</p>

    <p>On the other hand. Sun Rong wants to find a spiritual sword for Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has also learned something about it through his superb and familiar screen-peeping technology.</p>

    <p>In fact, it can be said that he and Sun Rong have the same ideas.</p>

    <p>Giving a sword when you are born is a long-standing tradition of the Wang family.</p>

    <p>Even if Sun Rong doesn't make preparations. Wang Ling will still find a way to get a handy spiritual sword for his sister.</p>

    <p>The requirements for the Spirit Sword Wang Ling are not very high either.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, you must be well-behaved and obedient. Be able to obey your sister's wishes.</p>

    <p>The second thing is to be flexible.</p>

    <p>This is an additional condition based on the first point.</p>

    <p>The main meaning is that I hope not to be blindly loyal.</p>

    <p>If Ah Nuan does something wrong, he must stop it in time.</p>

    <p>So. In summary, the requirements of Wang Ling are actually very simple.</p>

    <p>As long as this sword can accompany my sister to grow up, it can help Ah Nuan with her homework when she encounters difficulties in her studies, give her a massage to relieve stress when Ah Nuan is tired, and be the first to respond when Ah Nuan is bullied. Come out to protect, when Ah Nuan needs someone to accompany him to play games, he can practice and fly...</p>

    <p>The above conditions. Wang Ling are all neatly listed in the notebook.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, a spirit sword worthy of his sister is the minimum!</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. Apart from my strong combat power, I think there is nothing else..." Jingke stared at the conditions listed from beginning to end in his notebook. He suddenly felt that he was somewhat useless.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rubbed Jingke's White Hair again to show comfort.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, Jingke's companionship from childhood to adulthood is destined to be an inseparable part of his memory.</p>

    <p>And his attitude towards Jingke is like an "old father?"</p>

    <p>As long as Jingke can stay with him for his retirement...</p>

    <p>As for learning, gaming and combat power, he is already strong enough. So Jingke only needs to act cute on the side.</p>

    <p>Jingke sighed.</p>

    <p>He said he was looking for a spiritual sword. But he felt like he was looking for a confinement nanny...</p>

    <p>It's really hard to be a spiritual sword these days.</p>

    <p>You don't just have to be strong. You have to be able to develop morally, intellectually, physically, socially and aesthetically.</p>

    <p>You can go to the hall, you can go to the kitchen, and most importantly, you have to learn how to do functions...</p>

    <p>And in a sense, functions are also a compulsory course for modern spirit swords. For example, when the spirit sword strikes at a long distance, you have to calculate the parabola accurately!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is looking for a spiritual sword for Wang Nuan. In fact, he is also doing a job for himself. And girls may have more delicate ideas than me.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it would be better to just go with the flow and take advantage of this temporary Sword Conference to find a spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>"Jian Shen Alloy. This thing isn't really valuable to you, is it?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha's voice appeared behind Wang Ling. Lord Ma had already sent it back.</p>

    <p>Running back and forth between the two villas. Er Ha felt that it was not easy...</p>

    <p>"The competition over there is a temporary one. Bai Qiao said Jian Shen Alloy. The inventory of Sword King Realm is zero... I'm afraid it's too late to start mining and refining again. So I wanted to ask you if there is anything you can do." Er Ha said. Now it is just an errand boy.</p>

    <p>In the treasure house of Wang Ling. There is actually Jian Shen alloy.</p>

    <p>This is one of the rarest metals in the universe. The quantity in the entire Sword King Realm is very limited. Because it is extremely difficult to refine, the quantity is rare.</p>

    <p>And because it is rare, it is precious.</p>

    <p>A piece of alloy the size of a dice is enough to strengthen and upgrade the spirit sword.</p>

    <p>And it is such a rare Jian Shen alloy. There is a piece as big as a hill in the "King's Pants" of Wang Ling... and it is 100% pure. There is not a trace of impurities in it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used {Large Cutting Technique} to cut a piece as big as a basketball.</p>

    <p>Then it was handed over to Er Ha. "..." Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>This dice-sized alloy is enough to complete an enhancement upgrade.</p>

    <p>Just give me a piece as big as a basketball... those spirit swords would be enough to break them into pieces and remake them!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So when Bai Qiao and Er Ha brought the basketball-sized Jian Shen alloy to see Jiu You again, Jiu You was confused: "Is this... such a big lump?"</p>

    <p>What about the rarest metal in the universe...</p>

    <p>Why is there such a big lump here? And it's extremely pure!</p>

    <p>Jiu You stretched out his hand and felt the purity of the Jian Shen alloy. His whole body felt as if he was struck by lightning again: "100% purity... Where did Mr. Bai Qiao get this thing?"</p>

    <p>His voice was trembling.</p>

    <p>Even as the current custodian of the Sword King Realm, Jiu You can't hide his inner excitement.</p>

    <p>"Can I participate in this Sword Conference..." Jiu You felt itchy in his heart. With such a large piece of Jian Shen alloy as a reward, I am afraid that the entire Sword King Realm will riot next. Countless spiritual swords will fight for this piece of Jian. Shen Alloy grabs the head!</p>

    <p>"This is my exclusive collection. Of course you don't know. And such an alloy is of no use to me." Bai Qiao shrugged.</p>

    <p>Both she and Jingke are made of peach wood. Re-integrating metal elements into the body is a burden for them.</p>

    <p>And Jiu You also discovered something very magical.</p>

    <p>He found that the top spiritual swords seemed not to be made of metal.</p>

    <p>Jingke and Bai Qiao are peach trees.</p>

    <p>Presumably it's bamboo.</p>

    <p>And the third Yu Ling. is an amber sword.</p>

    <p>None of the top three swords were made of metal. Jiu You immediately felt that he had been born in the wrong person.</p>

    <p>"Just pay more attention to this competition. You will have extra rewards after the event is completed. Jian Shen Alloy. I still have it there."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao glanced at Jiu You and said: "As for Carter, Wu Jin, and Lao Man, they should be busy preparing for the event now. So it's up to you to inform them. Work hard. All rewards will be given. Indispensable."</p>

    <p>This actually also means Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Otherwise Bai Qiao would not dare to make the decision privately.</p>

    <p>When people are asked to work overtime temporarily, they should always be given benefits.</p>

    <p>There is a saying: as long as you give enough overtime pay, it doesn't matter if you are a cow or a horse...</p>

    <p>With such a reward, Wang Ling believes that this Sword Conference will go smoothly.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Lord Bai Qiao! We will definitely do our best!" Jiu You bowed deeply to Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>He himself has become more confident in the preparations for this event.</p>

    <p>No wonder. The charm of Jian Shen alloy is really too great.</p>

    <p>Humans suck cats. Sword Spirits suck iron!</p>

    <p>Anyone who is a sword spirit can't help but hold up the Jian Shen alloy and take a sip!</p>

    <p>"It smells so good!" Jiu You held the piece of Jian Shen alloy the size of a basketball with an intoxicated expression.</p>

    <p>"Is that an exaggeration?" Er Ha was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Give me an example."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao sent a message to Er Ha: "The Lord also had this expression when he smelled the peppery noodles of dry noodles."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I understand..."</p>
