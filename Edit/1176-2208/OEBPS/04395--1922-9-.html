  <h1>Chapter 1922 Invitation to the 9-Day Teahouse</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Number 1 Combat Training Ground of the Holy Academy of Sciences. This is an exclusive combat venue for the top fifteen elites of each grade in the Holy Academy. Rivers, lakes, mountains, forests, deserts, glaciers...almost all terrains that can be seen in reality. It's all covered here.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the stadium is extremely grand. From a distance, it can only cover an area the size of a football field. In fact, it combines the existing mature space expansion technology of the cultivation world to directly expand the area of the internal battle field to as much as 30,000 acres.</p>

    <p>And special light sensors are set up in all directions. They are used for various numerical statistics during the battle. From spell damage to small friction during the duel during physical combat, all are accurately recorded.</p>

    <p>This kind of combat training configuration is more luxurious than many universities in the world of cultivation. As the number one cultivation university in the country, Shengke has truly realized the combination of science and cultivation through existing scientific and technological means, and has further expanded its reputation in the country and even in the world. The influence of high school cultivation colleges around the world.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue arrived at the training hall that evening after collecting the data from Number 60 High School. The climate simulation system in the training hall completely separated the world inside from the outside world.</p>

    <p>The current climate simulation system is in clear sky mode. The simulated sunlight shines down from the ceiling, making Su Xingyue feel slightly dazzling.</p>

    <p>"Let's go together."</p>

    <p>As soon as she entered the venue, she saw a young man also dressed in ancient costume. He was at the entrance of a towering waterfall in the venue. He spoke calmly.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a black corset gown. His long black hair was high and mixed with a few silver threads. His eyes were slightly squinted. He had a mixture of heroism and evil charm. There was a sense of danger hidden in his smile.</p>

    <p>The rapids of the waterfall passed under his feet. She saw Qu Shuling standing as steady as a rock. He remained motionless. His figure was thin and straight. He was like an immortal with an indescribable aura.</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, all the people dormant around him took action in an instant.</p>

    <p>It was just an instant. Hidden weapons suddenly arrived. Some even went too far and even held air guns. They used condensed spiritual energy and vaporized bullets to directly aim at Qu Shuling's vital parts and fire them.</p>

    <p>In a brief moment, Qu Shuling was surrounded by dense attacks. There were various magic light groups, hidden weapons and even bullets all around him.</p>

    <p>However, all these flying foreign objects stopped involuntarily when they were eight feet away from him, and were directly frozen in the void.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling's expression was calm and composed. As a trump card who was proficient in all departments, he still maintained his inherent calm demeanor even when he was surrounded.</p>

    <p>In the next breath, he opened his squinted eyes. His handsome eyes revealed a sharp edge. All the flying foreign objects surrounding him appeared at the moment he opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>All return according to the original trajectory!</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue knew that this was Qu Shuling's best move. Because he was the trump card who was proficient in all systems. Therefore, he knew how to use natural elements to build a magnetic field, thereby forming a shield for himself that was invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by screams one after another around her, Su Xingyue knew that the competition was over.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling won again with an ace attitude.</p>

    <p>"Everyone is not injured, right?" The battle ended. Qu Shuling lowered his body. He waved his hand and summoned the medical levitation ball, which scanned everyone here.</p>

    <p>He had reserved his hand just now. He didn't make a heavy move.</p>

    <p>The students who competed with Qu Shuling also showed gratitude in their eyes: "President Qu is still amazing. I can't even match him."</p>

    <p>In fact, their strength is not weak. The students who can train in this Number 1 training ground are all the top fifteen talents in each grade. Looking at the whole country, they are all young pillars.</p>

    <p>As a result, they were completely crushed in the duel with Qu Shuling. They didn't even have the energy to breathe. This shows the terrifying strength of Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"When we fought President Qu just now, whoever's battle points exceeded 1,000 can use this to get a Tianling Pill from me later." Su Xingyue said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling smiled and chatted with everyone for a while. Then he naturally walked with Su Xingyue. The two seemed to be walking and chatting.</p>

    <p>Handsome men and beautiful women. Very pleasing to the eye.</p>

    <p>But a scene like this, except for the people in the training hall, is not something that outsiders can see.</p>

    <p>"You're back. How's it going?"</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling took the mineral water from Su Xingyue and asked.</p>

    <p>"Not enough to be afraid of."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue commented: "Those students from Number 60 High School are only in the Foundation Building stage. I think those from Jingba should be more than enough to deal with them."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling smiled and shook his head: "If this is a serious duel, I think Jingba's chances of winning are indeed very high. I'm afraid that the leaders at the top will come over. For this second college team's recommendation and review, there should be more than It needs to be in the form of a competition. A pure competition is too simple and crude."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Su Xingyue blinked and showed an incredulous look.</p>

    <p>"In this operation, we are representing the country. We are bringing honor to the country. We are two different universities. When we get to the scene, we must be at gunpoint. What we compete for is the ability to unite."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling said: "What do you think has enabled Number 60 High School to get to this point this year? Is it just the efforts of Miss Sun alone? Their team index and collective honor index are very high, comparable to our Shengke."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is! So they were selected as an exception for this recommendation list? I was wondering, they didn't even make it to the top 30, how come they were selected for this recommendation list?" Su Xingyue showed an expression of sudden realization.</p>

    <p>At this time, she saw Qu Shuling's steps suddenly stopped. She frowned deeply as she stared at the bottle cap she had unscrewed.</p>

    <p>"Did you win? Another bottle? No way... mineral water is also doing this now?" Su Xingyue was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Not another bottle."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling handed the bottle cap to Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue looked carefully at the small print inside the bottle cap. She slowly read: "Jiutian Teahouse...invitation?"</p>

    <p>After muttering for a while, Su Xingyue seemed to have thought of something: "Ah. I seem to have heard of this teahouse somewhere."</p>

    <p>"It's the teahouse in the old alley of Zhuquemen," Qu Shuling replied.</p>

    <p>"right!"</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue said: "I remember it was an internet celebrity teahouse. It was very famous."</p>

    <p>"Then you probably don't know who the manager of that teahouse is."</p>

    <p>"Is he a senior?"</p>

    <p>"He is a senior. He is also a powerful person."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling frowned: "I just don't know what the matter is when this senior asked me to go."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue: "Then you...are you going?"</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling nodded slightly: "Senior invited me. Of course I will go. And I think the people in Jingba may have received the same invitation. You go and tell them for me. If they also want to go to the center of the earth with us this time, to win glory. Ask them to pay attention to the invitation. Don't be vague."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Su Xingyue agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
