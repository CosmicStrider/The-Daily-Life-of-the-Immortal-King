  <h1>Chapter 1393 The Love Letter Controversy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>All kinds of love letters. In total, there are hundreds of them.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Chen Chao followed behind and helped Wang Ling clean up. When they were packing up, some of the letters were not stuck. The letter paper inside fell out. This just gave Guo Hao the opportunity to gossip.</p>

    <p>For a time, everyone in the rear storage room became a crowd.</p>

    <p>"Dear classmate Wang..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao read a letter and raised his head. The result was a surprise.</p>

    <p>Damn! Is it really written to Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>He continued reading: "Classmate Wang. I have admired you for a long time. Thinking of your strong physique makes me sleepless every night. Do you still remember. You once looked back at me and smiled..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Looking back and smiling?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao laughed dumbly: "It's really a prank! How could Wang Ling smile back at someone!"</p>

    <p>"It's not all necessarily a prank. There are so many letters. And the handwriting is all different."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao casually opened the remaining letters and began to read: "Classmate Wang! I miss you so much! Can I be your female support? I'm very cute..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang. Even if we are not in the same school, I still believe in what is said in a certain cartoon: yearning will transcend time and space and bring me to you."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang. I don't know what style you like. But I can change it for you! I have been eating papaya every day recently."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang! I heard that you like fair-skinned girls. For you, I use cucumber as a facial mask every day. Many girls in our class follow suit. The price of cucumbers in the vegetable market has increased because of you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Guo Hao, Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was so frightened that he dropped the letter.</p>

    <p>In these letters.</p>

    <p>Lolita, royal sister, salty or sweet... all types of girls are available.</p>

    <p>On-campus, off-campus, hospitals, Internet cafes, and various units are all available.</p>

    <p>"There are even people from outside the school... and some of them are female college students who have already gone to work!" Guo Hao's exclamation was covered by Chen Chao and Su Xiao before he reached the maximum volume.</p>

    <p>"You're crazy! Shouting so loudly!" Chen Chao hinted at the location of the door with his eyes.</p>

    <p>No one is there. But the three of them know it very well. They know that Sun Rong is right next to it...</p>

    <p>Because there were so many letters, they didn't know whether the letters were true or false.</p>

    <p>There must be elements of a prank in it. But if there is a true confession letter, if it is not handled well, it will be a disaster.</p>

    <p>"Anyway, what can be confirmed now is that there is definitely no such thing in our class. I know the handwriting of the girls in our class." Su Xiao said.</p>

    <p>He is a study committee member. He is exposed to everyone's homework in the class almost every day. He is very confident in handwriting recognition.</p>

    <p>It's not that there are no other girls in the class who like Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Mainly because Sun Rong is here.</p>

    <p>And a long time ago, Sun Rong and Wang Ling publicly confessed their feelings. No one wants to touch the bad luck of that wealthy young lady.</p>

    <p>"There are too many letters. I guess Wang Ling is also in a dilemma. I think I will handle this matter." At this time, Chen Chao stepped forward and volunteered.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled. He thought he heard wrongly.</p>

    <p>"Now these letters may contain mixed truth and falsehoods. If you throw them away, you will definitely be criticized if they are discovered. If you accept them, some girls may misunderstand that you are interested in them. So this It's something. Wang Ling Just pretend you don't know." Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>As a man who received love letters in junior high school, Chen Chao seems to be very experienced in handling such incidents.</p>

    <p>He reached out and patted Wang Ling on the shoulder: "We are all good brothers! Just leave this matter to me!"</p>

    <p>That resolute look in his eyes revealed a strong belief.</p>

    <p>Overall. Wang Ling thinks Chen Chao is a reliable man.</p>

    <p>And he never expected that Chen Chao would choose to stand up and help him at this time.</p>

    <p>What a good brother!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling returned the look of gratitude.</p>

    <p>Finally, a semester's friendship with classmates was not in vain!</p>

    <p>But this matter. Wang Ling feels that it is not that simple...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, just before school, Jiang Xiaoche received a message.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan, he hired a group of social thugs.</p>

    <p>The one who reached the highest level was a Nascent Soul stager. He was given the nickname Lao Hui.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui took about a dozen Golden Cores and planned to contain Wang Ling and Sun Rong on the way to school.</p>

    <p>Employing such a large number of people cost Jiang Xiaoche a huge price. Two years of salary were wiped out overnight.</p>

    <p>But he didn't feel bad.</p>

    <p>All this is to capture Sun Rong and tie the girl to his belt forever.</p>

    <p>As a result, just before school, Lao Hui got a piece of information. It was about "love letters."</p>

    <p>"What? You mean. That Wang Ling received a lot of love letters? Is the news reliable?" Jiang Xiaoche asked.</p>

    <p>"Very reliable. Brother Jiang, I spent money to find students to spy on. I heard that Miss Sun was depressed all day about this."</p>

    <p>Lao Hui replied: "Of course. I heard that there are also elements of pranks in love letters. But the number is too large. There are always a few letters that are true. And the love letters are written to all kinds of people. There are girls in and out of school."</p>

    <p>"What about these love letters now!?" Jiang Xiaoche became interested.</p>

    <p>These love letters are key!</p>

    <p>If you Wang Ling weren't showing mercy and flirting with women, where would you get so many love letters from?</p>

    <p>Since this love letter is key evidence, you have to get it! When the time comes, show it in front of Mr. Boss Sun. Even if the old man doesn't believe it, you have to believe it!</p>

    <p>"Now these love letters seem to belong to a person named Chen Chao. This person has a good relationship with Wang Ling. It seems that he intends to get rid of all the love letters for Wang Ling." Lao Hui said.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche nodded: "After school, you can divide up another group of people to get these love letters back."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>Inside a van on the street. Lao Hui nodded and hung up the phone.</p>

    <p>He sat in the passenger seat. Then he called to the people behind him: "Brothers, have you heard what Brother Jiang said? Since you have heard it, let's take action!"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" everyone behind responded.</p>

    <p>A whole van full of people.</p>

    <p>They had invisibility charms attached to their bodies. They were armed with steel pipes, machetes and other dangerous controlled weapons. They jumped out of the car one after another.</p>

    <p>These weapons look dangerous, but they are actually specially designed.</p>

    <p>It just looks scary.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche is back to work. But in fact, he is still afraid of hurting Sun Rong. So these weapons are special props used in filming blockbusters. They look dangerous, but in fact, when they are actually hit, they will not feel it at all. pain.</p>

    <p>So on this day, the following magical scene occurred when Number 60 High School was out of school.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, who was about to leave school to deal with the love letter, was immediately targeted by Lao Hui's group of people.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui's group of people were seen by Sun Rong again.</p>

    <p>Behind Sun Rong were Wang Zhen and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This is at the very back of everyone's mind.</p>

    <p>In the morning, he had actually guessed who was behind the prank love letter.</p>

    <p>And now. These two werewolves have jumped out!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was confused in his heart. He didn't understand what the purpose of Wang Zhen and Fang Xing was in doing this.</p>

    <p>Are you really just bored? Do you want to observe Sun Rong's reaction?</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling already knows it now.</p>

    <p>These love letters were originally written to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>So, if I cut off my love letter and give it to Liu Qingyi, what kind of magical chemical reaction will happen...</p>

    <p>Kneeling on the durian is definitely inevitable!</p>
