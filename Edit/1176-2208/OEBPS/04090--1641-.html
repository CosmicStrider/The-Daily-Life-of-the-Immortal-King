  <h1>Chapter 1641: Because you're afraid of pain, you're all on defense?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is not stupid. And he is also very aware of the dangers in this illusory world. Zhang Zhui and Li Xian are both eternal level powerful people. Even they were not completely sure before entering. They even I have reserved the information in advance. I also know that it may not be that simple in this fantasy world.</p>

    <p>There is danger. It is certain.</p>

    <p>If he goes there by himself, there won't be any unnecessary worries because of the shared power of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>But if you go there with Zhou Ziyi's strength, it's almost the same as giving up.</p>

    <p>But now after putting on the five-layer 3.0 point version of thermal underwear, everything becomes different...</p>

    <p>So sometimes it's not because of fear of pain that I go all out on defense.</p>

    <p>It's also possible that you're wearing too much thermal underwear...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had told Sun Rong before taking Zhou Ziyi. But he did not disclose this matter to Jiugong Liangzi... because he had no extra long johns in his inventory. Mainly five pieces of thermal. It is safer to focus on one person's underwear. If worn separately, the effect will not be achieved.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Jiugong Liangzi has never liked such thick clothes, so he did not tell Jiugong Liangzi about taking Zhou Ziyi to practice.</p>

    <p>He only said that he would take Zhou Ziyi out for a trip and that he would be back soon.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong received a text message from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She actually didn't mean to sell Zhuo Yi... But the current situation is a bit embarrassing. Because Jiugong Liangzi happened to be next to her...</p>

    <p>Today, she went to the villa where Jiugong Liangzi lived to see Jiugong Liangzi. She mainly wanted to discuss buying a birthday gift for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>December 26th.</p>

    <p>That is tomorrow.</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ling's birthday...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is wondering what gift to give to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not just Sun Rong. The entire Office of Strategic Deception is secretly organizing birthday gifts.</p>

    <p>If we just give away simple crispy noodles, this may no longer be able to meet the growing needs of this crispy noodle maniac.</p>

    <p>Maybe other people's gifts are less sophisticated.</p>

    <p>But she...</p>

    <p>In addition to giving gifts, I also want to convey my feelings to Wang Ling again with a gift.</p>

    <p>But she knew his character. He would definitely not like a gift that was too out-of-the-ordinary.</p>

    <p>So today, not long after the matter of Liu Renfeng came to an end, I found Jiugong Liangzi and came over to discuss giving gifts.</p>

    <p>This hasn't been formally discussed yet...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi A text message. It was sent over by coincidence at this time.</p>

    <p>"It's him again! Why does he always take him out! Not even me!" Jiugong Liangzi crossed his arms and said complainingly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't expect Jiugong Liangzi's eyesight to be so good. He was sitting opposite her. When he scanned her screen, the words in the text message were still upside down... He could still see clearly!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi, your eyesight is very good..."</p>

    <p>"Hmph! If it were your Wang Ling who sent me a text message at this time, you would be able to see it clearly!" Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, girls are inherently more sensitive.</p>

    <p>This is actually due to the fact that there are too many messages with Zhuo Yi. As a result, when the two characters Zhuo Yi appear anywhere, Jiugong Liangzi can recognize them in a second even if they are written backwards.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's words made Sun Rong blush: "What my Wang Ling...I found out. Liangzi, you have become bad!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "That's my Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Absolutely not!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi smiled: "You're just kidding. Look how nervous you are. I already have him!"</p>

    <p>As she said that, she stared at the phone screen: "But I still don't understand. Why is he so concerned about this Zhou Ziyi? Isn't it just to accept a disciple? He can accept him if he wants to."</p>

    <p>Because the things behind this involve Wang Ling. So it is actually quite complicated. It is not convenient to say more about these things Sun Rong for the time being... After all, in Jiugong Liangzi's knowledge at the moment. Wang Ling is still Zhuo Yi's apprentice.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong feels that it won't be too long before Jiugong Liangzi knows the truth about Wang Ling's true strength.</p>

    <p>But in the end, Zhuo Yi had to take the initiative to confess to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>It was actually inappropriate for her to come forward on her own.</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>I originally asked Jiugong Liangzi out. She just wanted to discuss the birthday gift. But it ended up involving other things...</p>

    <p>And now it looks like it's very troublesome.</p>

    <p>She could only comfort him: "After all, we are going out to practice together. Maybe that place is more dangerous. That's why he didn't take you Liangzi there."</p>

    <p>The more Jiugong Liangzi thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong: "But the problem is. Zhou Ziyi's level is similar to mine. Why can he go? Two men... do you think they went to some inappropriate place?"</p>

    <p>"No way. Senior Zhuo is not such a person..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"But. I'm just worried." Jiugong Liangzi looked anxious. She sighed: "You haven't been in love yet. You don't understand. Zhuo Yi and I were just in the early stages of our relationship... It's normal to feel like this."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Jiugong Liangzi slowly realized that his words seemed a bit heartbreaking for Sun Rong. He quickly apologized: "Ah, I'm sorry Rongrong. I didn't mean to..."</p>

    <p>"No...it's okay..."Sun Rong smiled awkwardly. He only felt sour in his mouth. It felt like he had eaten lemon slices.</p>

    <p>Everyone's in love. It's like she's the only one. There's no one else.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when the Wang family's wood will bloom...</p>

    <p>"Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was thinking wildly, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly called her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Huh?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Let's go together!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "But... But if this happens, we will be in danger..."</p>

    <p>Actually Sun Rong is not that scared. Mainly he is worried about Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>And if they go together, I'm afraid her current strength will be exposed in front of Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi smiled: "It's okay. I have a ghost talisman in my hand. I have 100,000 ghost soldiers at my disposal. Of course. It's not enough for just the two of us to go. That's why we need to find helpers."</p>

    <p>"Looking for help?" Sun Rong had a vague premonition.</p>

    <p>Then she saw Jiugong Liangzi quickly editing text messages on his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Who are you sending this to?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Of course it's senior Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly smiled and said: "YES! Done!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked: "Senior Jin Deng... agreed?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Of course. Because the senior and I were talking about demon removal. We didn't mention the Virtual Realm."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "But Senior Jin Deng also said that for the sake of safety, he needed to report the matter. Then he went to Lord Diulei."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Don't know why.</p>

    <p>After hearing what Jiugong Liangzi said, Sun Rong suddenly had an ominous premonition...</p>

    <p>Total feeling. The next Virtual Realm.</p>

    <p>It seems like it will be very lively...</p>
