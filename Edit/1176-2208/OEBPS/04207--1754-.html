  <h1>Chapter 1754 The Doomsday Straw</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just as Yin Hu said, before the earth was upgraded, there were a large number of cultivators in the True Immortal realm who had stayed in this realm for a long time.</p>

    <p>They chose not to be promoted at the beginning because of the overall load on the earth. They were worried that after their promotion, the aura of the earth would be depleted and there would not be enough for use.</p>

    <p>But now after the upgrade, as the problem of spiritual energy has been solved, the {True Immortal Convention} established by various countries back then has come to an end.</p>

    <p>However, what Yin Hu and others do not know is that the {True Immortal Convention} is just an agreement. Before the earth is upgraded, some cultivation countries are actually planning to accumulate resources and let their military commanders be promoted to True Immortal. A realm above the realm.</p>

    <p>Trust between people is very weak these days. The competition between the major cultivating countries is even more like a game between state machines. It is impossible for any one to let go of the opportunity to surpass other cultivating countries and become the hegemon.</p>

    <p>Take Mixiu Country for example. Over the years, they have been observing the True Immortal Convention on the surface, but in fact, they have been secretly planning to promote their generals to the True Immortal realm for more than a generation or two.</p>

    <p>It's just that you have to step into the True Immortal realm. But it's not that easy.</p>

    <p>And among them, talent is a very important part...</p>

    <p>Therefore, many generals in cultivation countries seem to be abiding by the regulations in recent years. In fact, this is not the case.</p>

    <p>It's just that they simply don't have the talent to move to a higher level.</p>

    <p>But talented people still exist.</p>

    <p>The next realm after True Immortal is Venerated Immortal. Of course, there are very few people who can accidentally step into the interlayer realm between the two realms like Lord Diulei. That is the True Venerated Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>This is a promotion event with a small probability. It is also a manifestation of talent. Because entering the True Venerated Immortal realm, this indicates that the cultivator's own foundation will be more solid. In the future, he will have the talent to impact the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>But in most cases, the next level of True Immortal is Venerated Immortal. Their combat power is the same as that of Zhenyuan immortals.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu thought that the current strength of the ten generals was still in the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>But in fact, his intelligence fell behind after all.</p>

    <p>In the past few years of observing the {True Immortal Convention}, the ten generals have certainly abided by the treaty, but they have never forgotten their practice.</p>

    <p>To reach the realm of Venerated Immortal, it is not enough to just pile up resources. High-level cultivators need to cultivate their minds. As long as the state of mind is reached, even a small part of the resources can reach a high position.</p>

    <p>This is the legendary strategy of lying dormant and hiding one's strength and biding time.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In the layered space Number 3, there was a big fluctuation at this time. There were streaks of divine light, and it was like the sky and the earth were falling apart. The building used to imprison Jiang Yingying for collecting videos also seemed a little shaky under such big fluctuations.</p>

    <p>"What's going on..." Yin Hu was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Sir Yin Hu. Someone broke into the layered space!" Daishu, who had been holding a tablet to monitor the status of the space, immediately replied.</p>

    <p>There was also a look of shock on his face. An expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>Because the intruders were too aggressive and domineering. They clearly separated several layers of space and had absolute encryption. But the other party seemed to have already figured out which layer Jiang Yingying was locked in. After precise positioning, they drove straight in.</p>

    <p>"Stop with the backup, we're evacuating with her!" Yin Hu made a decision immediately.</p>

    <p>He tried to evacuate the space with Jiang Yingying and hide in a new layered space. However, Daishu's face showed a look of embarrassment.</p>

    <p>Because he found that the layered space was no longer under his control. The senior who stood behind them had arranged everything. He only gave them a tablet to control everything. They could divide the space into as many layers as they wanted with one click. Foolish operation. Just click a little.</p>

    <p>But now Daishu discovered that the buttons on it didn't work.</p>

    <p>At this time, a red dot appeared on the map of the tablet. This was the invasion display function of layered space Number 3. The red dot was the location of the intruder.</p>

    <p>When the picture on the screen was projected, Jiang Yingying also saw the appearance of the person who came, it was a person wearing a mask of nine-tailed fox, holding a bandage sword.</p>

    <p>The mysterious woman wearing Hanfu... in order to hide Aohai. Sun Rong carefully wrapped Aohai tightly in a special white bandage.</p>

    <p>Because her face was blocked and her figure was covered with loose Hanfu, she was unable to realize who it was.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Sun Ying'er's patient explanation, Sun Rong was able to successfully reach the third level of space.</p>

    <p>This is not the first time she has experienced combat. After having several combat experiences, Sun Rong clearly understands the importance of blocking the map. This is to ensure that the target does not escape.</p>

    <p>Therefore, she just entered the third space, and then directly offered a "sea oath", this is the use of the power of the Aohai contract with a designated space, so that the space belongs to the control of the Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The architectural layout of space three is almost the same as that of the first floor. Only a few buildings have changed. Sun Rong moved forward and accurately locked the position of the old mulberry tree that was previously detected outside.</p>

    <p>A sharp sword energy swept across, causing Yin Hu to break out in cold sweat on the spot.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong walked over step by step. At the same time, she saw endless black divine birds flying in the sky. They looked like crows, but they were larger than crows.</p>

    <p>These black divine birds circled in the air, forming a swirling vortex, and then instantly converged like a long dragon swooping down, charging at Sun Rong and attacking her.</p>

    <p>"Huh? Eternal One?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was surprised. I felt that this black divine bird actually contained the power of the Eternal One.</p>

    <p>Could it be that apart from Master Wu Xin, are there any Eternals who were left out of the Corpse Map and are still alive today?</p>

    <p>She looked calm. She stretched her arms, revealing a snow-white wrist. Aohai, whose hand was wrapped in a bandage, simulated a red sword energy at this time, pressing toward the void. It was like an endless bright ray of light pouring down on the divine bird in the sky.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The moment these black divine birds touched them, they let out a painful cry.</p>

    <p>This kind of power is so amazing. He can fight against tens of thousands of divine birds in the sky by himself without any difficulty at all.</p>

    <p>"Eh. What is this?" Sun Rong looked at the black divine bird that was burned all over the sky. Suddenly she stretched out her hand and pinched the remaining debris after the black divine bird was burned.</p>

    <p>It was not until this moment that she suddenly realized that this black divine bird was actually a product made of black straw.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the Eternal Elder. He is indeed extraordinary." Sun Rong was secretly surprised in her heart.</p>

    <p>The combat power of each of these black divine birds is as high as the True Immortal realm. If they all swoop down and explode in a suicide attack, the power may be superimposed to the Venerated Immortal realm or even higher.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. Before they could rush down, these sacred birds made of black straw were burned to pieces by her.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Wang Ling peeked at the screen and saw this scene. He was also stunned in his heart.</p>

    <p>Because he recognized the origin of the black straw.</p>

    <p>That's something called doomsday straw...</p>
