  <h1>Limited extra chapter for Valentine's Day 2022: Immortal King's "lonely" lover...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Preliminary summary: The timeline of this extra chapter is when Wang Ling &amp; Sun Rong were 29 years old. At this time, Sun Rong had just given birth to Wang Shu. Wang Shu's age was: half a year old.</p>

    <p>Text:</p>

    <p>There is a saying that life is impermanent. The big intestine wraps up the small intestine...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never dreamed that one day he would be able to take care of a baby himself.</p>

    <p>He thinks that he is quite qualified as a father. After all, he often helped change his sister's diapers when Wang Nuan was a child.</p>

    <p>That was the first time he experienced facing a new born little life. That kind of nervousness, urgency and various cautious emotions. Although Talisman suppressed his emotions, there was a feeling in his heart. He felt that Wang Nuan was him. A very special existence in life.</p>

    <p>He likes his sister very much.</p>

    <p>So almost when Wang Nuan was a child, Wang Ling had already mastered various routine operations skills of a nanny, such as preparing milk powder, changing diapers, and coaxing him to sleep.</p>

    <p>The children in Old Wang's family basically drink milk powder. Even if they are breast-fed, they have to express the breast milk first and put it in a special bottle for consumption. Otherwise, they are easily in danger...</p>

    <p>As for the danger, Wang Ling cannot elaborate in detail. After all, the children of the Old Wang family have been extremely destructive since the generation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These skills he mastered back then are now used on his son Wang Shu. It is really the benefit of preparing lessons in advance.</p>

    <p>Of course. Preparing milk powder, feeding, changing diapers, etc. are not the most difficult aspects of raising a baby in Wang Ling's opinion.</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling stared at little Wang Shu, who was less than half a year old, and fell into the "fear" in his heart again.</p>

    <p>That's right. All the children in the Old Wang family are in their infancy. The scariest and most terrifying part.</p>

    <p>That's... burping...</p>

    <p>Of course it would be good if the photo can be taken smoothly.</p>

    <p>But if Jin is not careful, it is very likely that he will directly shoot a Qiankun Demon Penetrating Light Killing Cannon that destroys the Death Ray series...</p>

    <p>It is not impossible to drill a hole directly into the earth and open it directly.</p>

    <p>But it was different from Wang Nuan. Wang Shu was born at full term. There was no secret cultivation medicine like Mother Wang when she gave birth to Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>At that time, the birth of Wang Nuan was accelerated. The main reason was that Mother Wang was an ordinary person in the body-refining stage. In the modern world of cultivation, Mother Wang was really a housewife with stronger strength and longer life in the body-refining stage. Therefore, it is a wise choice to give birth to Wang Nuan as soon as possible after becoming pregnant.</p>

    <p>This directly guarantees the safety of two people at the same time.</p>

    <p>And soon after Ah Nuan girl was born, with the development of Eternal Talisman, the quality of Ah Nuan girl's childhood was guaranteed. She no longer needed to be as cautious as Wang Ling was when she was a child, for fear of laughing and fighting with her friends. Send the person directly to the morgue...</p>

    <p>As for why I chose to let Wang Shu be born at full term.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is also because Sun Rong's realm far exceeds that of Mother Wang. Especially the realm of combat power that can be achieved after the Aohai human sword is united. It can even reach directly above the ancestral realm. It is beyond the reach of many eternal beings.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this is also Wang Ming's suggestion.</p>

    <p>When Wang Shu was one month pregnant, Wang Ming suggested that Sun Rong also wear the Eternal Talisman and then take off the Talisman until Wang Shu was full term.</p>

    <p>There is an advantage to doing this. That is, it can help Wang Shu learn how to control his powerful power when he was still in his mother's womb.</p>

    <p>If everything goes well, and with diligent study and guidance after birth, Wangshu may not need to wear the Eternal Talisman. He will be able to skillfully control the powerful power he possesses.</p>

    <p>Although wearing Talisman can indeed help Wang Ling and Wang Nuan live a normal life to a certain extent. But having something stuck on their bodies every day is like putting a piece of dog skin plaster on them. The feeling is indeed uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>It is the dream of the children of the Old Wang family to be able to release their power independently. Wang Ling is still working hard. And it feels like he will be able to take off the Talisman in a short time. He will be able to take off the Talisman freely without relying on the Eternal Talisman.</p>

    <p>But in order to let my son get rid of the pain of applying dog skin plaster as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this matter must be dealt with from a young age. Therefore, as soon as Wang Shu is born, he does not wear any seal to seal Talisman. There are no additional restrictions. He relies entirely on his own control of power.</p>

    <p>So far, not much has happened...</p>

    <p>But burping is a physiological reaction. Sometimes Wang Shu wants to control it, but he can't control it.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling witnessed with his own eyes how destructive the anti-air beams sprayed by his sister were when he was a child. Therefore, he couldn't help but shed cold sweat on his cheeks when facing Wang Shu.</p>

    <p>When the little guy is half a year old, he is very particular about the milk he usually drinks. At first, he drank breast milk. Now he drinks special milk powder jointly developed by Wang Ming and Immortal Toya. Occasionally, he drinks some milk powder brought by Wang Muyu. Here comes the Dragon Milk Powder.</p>

    <p>Since Muyu unified the dragon clan, although the dragon clan has not revived to the glorious days of the past, the true pure-blooded dragon has been reappeared through DNA traceability technology through the genes of Wang Muyu's omnipotent dragon.</p>

    <p>The Dragon Clan milk powder has now become a popular product sold by the Dragon Clan throughout the universe.</p>

    <p>Expensive value.</p>

    <p>It's hard to find a jar out there.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is available as much as you want.</p>

    <p>That little guy Wang Muyu seemed to be sending truckloads of food to him for free.</p>

    <p>I almost gave the little female dragons in the dragon farm specializing in milk production an emo treatment.</p>

    <p>To this day, he and Wang Muyu still have separate relationships.</p>

    <p>He regarded Wang Muyu as his younger brother.</p>

    <p>But what about Wang Muyu? He calls him brother in front of outsiders, but still calls him dad in private... which makes Wang Ling very embarrassed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling held Xiao Wangshu skillfully. His palms gently landed on the little guy's back. The palms of his hands were half empty. The technique was very particular.</p>

    <p>At the same time, while burping, Wang Ling was also observing the change in Xiao Wangshu's face. If it turned into an abnormal blue-purple color, Wang Ling would immediately teleport to an alien planet. Wang Shu aimed at an uninhabited alien planet and blasted out the blocked milk burps.</p>

    <p>However, this will always lead to bad habits.</p>

    <p>Just like people, once you are lazy, you will develop laziness.</p>

    <p>Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary, Wang Ling will not easily change positions with his royal skills.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the little guy is also very upbeat.</p>

    <p>He held it in for a while, and then quickly let out a soft and long "uh"...</p>

    <p>In the words of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Shu is well-behaved. He doesn't look like a boy. According to Father Wang and Mother Wang, he has a casual personality. When he is quiet, he is a quiet handsome man. When he is serious, he is also decisive and straightforward. temper.</p>

    <p>One thing is the same as Ah Nuan girl. She also has a precocious constitution. She basically knows a little bit about everything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is feeling emotional.</p>

    <p>Then, a sound of milky milk directly broke the warm atmosphere of fatherly kindness and sonly filial piety.</p>

    <p>"Dad, aren't you tired from holding me? You can put me down now." Wang Shu looked at Wang Ling and said.</p>

    <p>Yes. He is only half a year old. This little guy can already speak. And he also speaks a fluent Beijing accent...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Sometimes I even think that this little guy is good at everything. He is also well-behaved. But speaking too early ruins his cute image. Although his voice is very childish, I don't know where I learned the Beijing accent. He always has his own accent. He has the air of an old man from a courtyard house.</p>

    <p>"..." Helpless. Wang Ling had no choice but to gently put Wang Shu back on the carpet.</p>

    <p>I saw the little guy heading towards the bathroom. Wang Ling just reached out to hug him. But I saw the little guy twisted his face. With a bright smile on his chubby face, he said, "I can go to the bathroom by myself."</p>

    <p>He said this.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought...</p>

    <p>The baby is only half a year old and can already pee on his own in the toilet.</p>

    <p>Although the posture is strange.</p>

    <p>Because he is not tall enough, Wang Shu is to levitate his body and perform flying down three thousand feet while suspended in mid-air.</p>

    <p>"Dad, today is Valentine's Day. You should go out to celebrate the festival with our mother. You can leave me alone." Wang Shuchong Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the time. It was now half past six in the evening.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is still a very strong female entrepreneur. She is busy with her career day and night.</p>

    <p>But on Valentine's Day, they made an appointment to have dinner at the newly opened interstellar restaurant in Tianhuan Fortress while watching the falling stars.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling could never worry about his son. For the past six months, he had been taking care of Wang Shu at home all the time.</p>

    <p>As a result, the little guy couldn't bear it any longer. He directly urged Wang Ling to hurry up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried: "Uncle Diulei and Uncle Ying. How about... I call them here?"</p>

    <p>"But they also have to celebrate the holidays."</p>

    <p>Xiao Wang Shu shook his head and objected: "It's okay. I won't have any problems at home alone. I can just study by myself."</p>

    <p>That's right...</p>

    <p>Study alone. This is also one of the characteristics of the little guy's well-behaved nature.</p>

    <p>The king of emperors, generals and ministers! The magic that can save the world!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Remember. Less than a month after birth, the little guy can already analyze his own name. Although the handwriting is not very beautiful, it is not easy for a baby.</p>

    <p>As for the rest of the homework. Wang Ling thought that the little guy would just memorize poems and the like. But now I saw Wang Shu pull out the {Differential Geometry Lecture Notes} from under the sofa and prepare to learn nonlinear partial equations. Differential equation. Wang Ling The expression on the entire face was filled with shock.</p>

    <p>On the surface, he is a literary boy. But on the inside, he is a science guy?</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling's surprise does not lie here.</p>

    <p>It's because he and his son have been getting along day and night these days. But he has no idea that his son is secretly studying and practicing behind his back!</p>

    <p>How old is this? It's so curly...</p>

    <p>"What are you doing standing there in a daze? Go quickly." Wang Shu couldn't stand it anymore and urged him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling changed into the clothes he had prepared in advance. When he left home, he turned back every step of the way. He seemed afraid that something would happen to Wang Shu.</p>

    <p>Just opened the door.</p>

    <p>Then I saw Sun Rong standing at the door wearing an evening dress that exposed most of her shoulders.</p>

    <p>"I was just going to find you..." Wang Ling said as he looked at Sun Rong in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Look at this. She must have just planned to use facial recognition to enter the door. But she happened to meet Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This was dressed up carefully by Sun Rong for today's Valentine's Day. Looking at his wife's snow-white shoulders and back, Wang Ling just took a deep breath. He took off his coat on the spot and gave it to Sun RongCover.</p>

    <p>He blushed slightly and muttered softly while covering up his clothes: "In the future, you are not allowed to wear so little..."</p>

    <p>"I thought you only wanted your son and didn't want me anymore." Sun Rong hugged him naturally. His heartbeat began to speed up unconsciously: "I've finished all my work for now. I can do it later. Stay with you at home."</p>

    <p>"Going to a restaurant?"</p>

    <p>"What restaurant are we going to? Everyone is here. I just want to see you quickly."</p>

    <p>"That gift..."</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Don't give me another diamond planet."</p>

    <p>"Then what do you want?"</p>

    <p>"I want you to deliver!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Tonight! Right now... right now!"</p>

    <p>...</p>
