  <h1>Chapter 1802 Signature of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After chatting for about ten minutes, Pei Xiaoyuan left. He left under the comfort of everyone at Number 60 High School. Although even Pei Xiaoyuan himself did not realize what happened.</p>

    <p>After receiving the news that he was going back to wait for instructions, Chen Chao took another signature of the leader of Gray Cult and gave it to Pei Xiaoyuan. Pei Xiaoyuan almost fainted with joy.</p>

    <p>In fact, this signature was signed by Wang Ling. It has nothing to do with Sun Rong or Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Look what I'm doing, Lingzi. Think about it. Boss Sun Rong was in the room just now so how could she come out to sign it? Otherwise, everything would be exposed. You secretly signed one that she gave as a gift. This plan is perfect."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao gave a thumbs up. He bared his teeth and said with a smile: "And Boss Sun Rong has been imitating your handwriting. It's not like you don't know. Her signature is the same as yours. On the surface, there's no difference. Except for a few of us no one can see it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>No difference?</p>

    <p>Of course there is a difference...</p>

    <p>And there is a big difference.</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan's father is the leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao League. His family is so close to the Arch Pope...</p>

    <p>The cross and the so-called holy water. Wang Ling didn't know if it works.</p>

    <p>But this signature of his can really ward off evil spirits... and is extremely lethal!</p>

    <p>"This time, I really bother everyone. Mrs. Lawen has sent the information for the Variety Show Challenge. Now let's discuss how to deal with it."</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong walked out of the room with a red face and said.</p>

    <p>She heard Chen Chao talking about imitating the Wang Ling in front of everyone in the suite.</p>

    <p>This was tantamount to a public execution. It made her so shy that she just wanted to find a hole in the ground to crawl into...</p>

    <p>She had no choice but to open the door and change the subject to discuss the variety show challenge.</p>

    <p>If these big guys are allowed to expand the topic...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it will really get out of control later on.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Pei Xiaoyuan received the signature of Gray Cult leader signed by Wang Ling. His heart was filled with joy.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that the leader of Gray Cult, who looked like a big boss, could sign such a delicate name. Sure enough, Gray Cult is indeed a place where cultural people gather.</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan has loved Chinese culture since he was a child, especially Chinese characters. He thinks these are the most beautiful characters in the world. In the conversation in the suite just now, he spoke Mandarin.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't speak so fluently and with a strong accent, judging from the results of the conversation, at least the Huaxiu people understood it.</p>

    <p>"Master." Downstairs of the hotel, surrounded by several white warriors, Pei Xiaoyuan got back into his black business car. The butler had been waiting for a long time.</p>

    <p>"The things are done. Now go home." Pei Xiaoyuan was in a good mood.</p>

    <p>Returning to the entrance hall of the small western-style building where he lived, he saw the Arch Pope's boots again.</p>

    <p>As before, he heard chanting coming from the house.</p>

    <p>"Haah... haah..."</p>

    <p>"Ha... ha... li... lu... ya!"</p>

    <p>Although Pei Xiaoyuan didn't know why the voice sounded so urgent, he didn't take it to heart.</p>

    <p>It was very difficult for the Arch Pope to come to their home to exorcise demons. It seems quite normal to be prone to lack of oxygen when reciting holy books.</p>

    <p>He returned to his room as usual. He locked the door obediently, opened his small drawer, and stored the Wang Ling signature of the leader of Gray Cult in the drawer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Pei Luoqi arrived home, the first thing he saw was his wife fainted in the bedroom. The expression on her face was ugly. She was in a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>Lying on the other side was the disheveled Pope...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Pei Luoqi's mind went blank. He didn't know what happened. That such a thing could happen.</p>

    <p>As the leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao League, Pei Luoqi tried his best to suppress his overwhelming emotions and calm down his mind.</p>

    <p>He checked his wife's injuries. He was surprised to find that his wife had no traces of being tainted. She was just obviously a little frightened and in a trance.</p>

    <p>"Dear, what on earth... happened?" Pei Luoqi was full of doubts.</p>

    <p>"It was the Arch Pope who... protected me..."</p>

    <p>When Pei Luoqi's wife said this, tears flowed down: "You have been away from home. I don't know how to tell you about this... Earlier, when the Pope came to visit me and Xiaoyuan, he discovered our home. There is a jealous ghost..."</p>

    <p>"Jealous ghost?"</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope said. This is a kind of evil spirit produced by excessive jealousy in life... It thrives by collecting people's jealousy. And this jealous ghost was single in life, so it is most unlikely to see a happy family."</p>

    <p>At this point, Pei Luoqi's wife couldn't help crying again: "And that jealous ghost has always wanted to taint me..."</p>

    <p>"Such a thing could happen!" Pei Luoqi was shocked. He hugged his wife tightly: "I'm sorry, dear. I should spend more time at home. But... this has nothing to do with the Arch Pope. What connection?"</p>

    <p>His wife sighed: "The Arch Pope found out about this. He also knew that the jealous ghost wanted to taint me. So he calculated the time when the jealous ghost would appear. He wanted to hide in the bedroom and wait for the jealous ghost to appear. Then he would purify it. But This jealous ghost is more terrifying than the Arch Pope imagined..."</p>

    <p>"So the Arch Pope is..."</p>

    <p>"I couldn't purify myself. Instead, I was betrayed by the jealous ghosts..."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi covered his mouth in horror. He looked at the dying Arch-Pope with disheveled clothes on the ground. He felt inexplicably complicated emotions in his heart.</p>

    <p>Because the Arch Pope himself is not very strong, but he has achieved such a high status entirely by relying on his own character and the faith and preaching of all parties.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi regretted it. He should not have doubted the character of the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the Arch Pope made such a big sacrifice to protect his wife and son.</p>

    <p>"What about the jealous ghost now?" Pei Luoqi asked at this time.</p>

    <p>The wife's face became horrified again: "Before you came, you sent out a holy light. Then I heard your voice when I woke up... But I... I can feel it! This hateful thing is still there!" It's still here!"</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid, dear! I'm back!"</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi comforted his wife.</p>

    <p>Then at this moment, the Arch Pope's body twitched, and he stood up from the ground like a zombie.</p>

    <p>There was a kind of madness on his face. There was an unprecedented terrible resentment and yin in his body. Even his tongue had changed.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi quickly covered his wife's eyes.</p>

    <p>He saw that the Arch Pope, who was suspected to be possessed by the jealous ghost, stretched out his long green tongue. First he swept his lips. Then he licked the tip of his nose...</p>

    <p>Then he changed his eyes and suddenly attacked Pei Xiaoyuan's room!</p>
