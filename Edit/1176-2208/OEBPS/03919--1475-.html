  <h1>Chapter 1475 Routines and Counter-Routines</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling This outfit of Izumo Benyue is really very stylish. He is like a young man walking out of a painting. The golden white crane pattern embroidered on the lower skirt of the Hanfu seems to be spreading his wings under his feet. It seems like getting up.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong found many girls secretly taking photos in the Hanfu store.</p>

    <p>Taking photos secretly without consent is actually very disrespectful.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling actually doesn't care.</p>

    <p>There is an upgraded version of {Great Shielding Technique}. Everything makes him feel reassured.</p>

    <p>These candid photos look normal now. But if they want to be spread... the entire photo will be automatically coded.</p>

    <p>And after the coding is completed, the images related to Wang Ling will gradually disappear in the memories of these candid photographers.</p>

    <p>However, although Wang Ling doesn't care that much, Sun Rong is obviously disgusted with the behavior of those who take secret photos.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Please wait for us in the VIP room!"</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong directly showed his privileged black card to the store Xiaoer.</p>

    <p>Although Brother Xiaoer is from the Huaguo Shuilian Group, his acting skills are very good. After seeing the privileged black card, he was stunned for a while. Then he quickly put on a shocked expression: "Then please follow me..."</p>

    <p>The VIP room of the Hanfu experience store has separate men's and women's changing rooms, lounges and additional dressing services. No need to queue up.</p>

    <p>The girl didn't take it out directly before because she planned to keep a low profile. But now she feels that she can't do it unless she takes action.</p>

    <p>The eyes of the girls around me looking at Wang Ling are so hot. Some of them already have boyfriends. Their eyes are still looking at them like a nympho...</p>

    <p>Don't you have any sense of shame?</p>

    <p>And those men!</p>

    <p>He actually allowed his girlfriend to take pictures of other boys...</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong felt his head was hot. He quickly took Wang Ling's hand and walked towards the VIP room.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until she entered the empty room that the girl suddenly realized what she had just done.</p>

    <p>From the reception room of the Hanfu experience store to the VIP room.</p>

    <p>About ten meters away.</p>

    <p>She actually held the boy's hand and walked all the way!</p>

    <p>"Ah! Classmate Wang Ling... I didn't mean to do it!" Sun Rong held his forehead, face flushed.</p>

    <p>She felt that she was impulsive after all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at Sun Rong's delicate hands. He felt that the girl's palms were sweating slightly. The long fingers with clear knuckles were grabbing him, as if they were grabbing something very important. have to.</p>

    <p>When Li Youyue and others slowly walked into the VIP room from the main entrance, Sun Rong separated his hands in a panic.</p>

    <p>This scene made Li Youyue laugh secretly.</p>

    <p>The girl's reaction is so youthful that it makes people find it even more adorable.</p>

    <p>She quickly stepped forward and took Sun Rong's arm, breaking the awkward situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>"Let's go. Rongrong?" Li Youyue whispered. She narrowed her eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Yeah!" Sun Rong secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, he brought Li Youyue over.</p>

    <p>This happened so timely!</p>

    <p>Before changing clothes, Li Youyue did not forget to say hello to Wang Ling: "That Wang Ling. Rongrong and I will go change clothes first. There are drinks and snacks in the lounge. You can eat while you're there. wait."</p>

    <p>"eh..." Wang Ling watched the two of them enter the women's locker room. He himself was also stunned for a long time.</p>

    <p>From his own personal aesthetic point of view, he feels that the upper body effect of this "Izumo Flying to the Moon" set is just okay.</p>

    <p>If he had long flowing hair, it might be more in line with those people's idea of a "beautiful young man with an ancient style."</p>

    <p>But long hair. A bit shameful.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like I can't do that.</p>

    <p>So. Is it really that beautiful...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the full-length mirror placed in the lounge, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Holiday Inn Gujie. Single suite.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was sitting alone on the bed. Suddenly he felt a sense of emptiness.</p>

    <p>That Zhuo Yi... actually left her alone in the suite.</p>

    <p>Although there is only a wall between her suite and Zhuo Yi's suite.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt an inexplicable feeling of displeasure in his heart.</p>

    <p>The reason why this replica {Ghost Book} caused a riot is still not clear yet.</p>

    <p>What should we do if another riot breaks out?</p>

    <p>Snort!</p>

    <p>What an incompetent bodyguard!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was filled with resentment.</p>

    <p>"So boring..." The girl lay on the bed bored and muttered.</p>

    <p>Several local variety shows that she was passionate about could have been a way to pass the time.</p>

    <p>But you can't see it in Huaxiu. The wall is too thick. To watch a variety show, you have to climb over the wall to watch it... The most important thing is that it is illegal to climb over the wall now. Jiugong Liangzi didn't think of such a moth.</p>

    <p>It would be bad if he was caught and ordered to be deported.</p>

    <p>There are no variety shows to pass the time. Jiugong Liangzi naturally wants to make his life more fulfilling.</p>

    <p>This Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street is a famous scenic spot in Songhai City. She finally came here... but she could only stay in the hotel and keep an eye on her. It was really frustrating!</p>

    <p>In fact, it doesn't seem impossible to go out.</p>

    <p>After all, the three guys in Awei were much more honest than she thought.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi is afraid that he will be laughed at by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She is the future heir of the Jiugong family. How can she do it without even this little bit of determination?</p>

    <p>So the girl had to endure it by herself.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she was secretly competing with Zhuo Yi in her heart: "Zhuo Yi... I'll see when you come to me..."</p>

    <p>And it's right next door to Jiugong Liangzi's room.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi rested his head on one hand and leaned against the bed.</p>

    <p>Although there was a wall, he could hear the girl's voice clearly.</p>

    <p>This also includes breathing sounds.</p>

    <p>This feeling makes Zhuo Yi feel very subtle...</p>

    <p>After hearing Jiugong Liangzi's muttering, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but raise the corners of his lips.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the clock on the wall and estimated the time.</p>

    <p>After opening a single apartment, he deliberately ignored Jiugong for a while.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that the girl's patience seemed to be stronger than I thought.</p>

    <p>Although he was complaining, he never rushed over to knock on his door.</p>

    <p>But with Jiugong Liangzi's character and temper, it might be difficult for him to take the initiative to find him, right?</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi doesn't intend to get used to it either.</p>

    <p>If this happens in the future, it won't work if you spoil it.</p>

    <p>To deal with such a little girl, you must have a lot of patience.</p>

    <p>Then. Zhuo Yi closed his eyes and waited patiently.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how much time had passed. He heard Jiugong Liangzi's breathing becoming more and more rapid. He suddenly knew in his heart that the girl's patience might have reached its limit.</p>

    <p>Now there is only one final step left.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had a premonition. He felt that the next second, the girl would rush out and knock on his door.</p>

    <p>However, what greeted him was not the sound of the door opening...</p>

    <p>Instead, there was a muffled sound of "gudong."</p>

    <p>"There's something wrong with this sound..."</p>

    <p>This time. Zhuo Yi couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>He quickly got up and ran over to check the specific situation.</p>

    <p>After swiping the door of the girl's room with a universal card.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi then saw Jiugong Liangzi sitting on the ground with a painful expression on his left ankle.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?"Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Jiugong Liangzi remained silent, he made a rough guess based on the situation at hand: "I tried to open the door in a hurry, but fell flat on the ground and sprained my foot?"</p>

    <p>After saying that, the girl's face immediately turned red: "I... I didn't want to go out!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi leaned over. He couldn't help but reached out and pinched Jiugong Liangzi's face: "Classmate Jiugong, are you an idiot?"</p>

    <p>He smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>I wanted to trick Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The result was disastrous. I was the one who was tricked.</p>

    <p>"Don't pinch my face without permission..." the girl protested softly.</p>

    <p>"Oh. Sorry."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled softly. Then he sat down cross-legged and, talking to himself, picked up the girl's left foot and placed it on his knee.</p>

    <p>"You don't want..."</p>

    <p>"Providing emergency medical treatment for the employer is also the responsibility of the bodyguard. This is just a job. Don't get me wrong, Jiugong."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Jiugong Liangzi. He asked seriously: "So. Where does it hurt? Please tell me."</p>
