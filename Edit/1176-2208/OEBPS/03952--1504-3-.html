  <h1>Chapter 1504 The Sunrise of Three People</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Wang Ling stopped, the Sixth Madam and the demon spirit inside her body did not come back to their senses for a long time.</p>

    <p>The pink pupils dissipated and turned into the black pupils of the Sixth Madam. Although her soul had switched back, her body still couldn't stop trembling.</p>

    <p>A ghost named "Houlang?"</p>

    <p>Where does this power come from... Why is there such a powerful ability...</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady and the demon spirit have been setting up their plans on Sun Island for many years. They thought they had everything under control.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that an iron plate would be kicked up at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Is there ever a ghost named Houlang on Sun Island?" Mrs. Six was so frightened that her face turned pale and her lips turned purple.</p>

    <p>There was a burning pain on the top of her head.</p>

    <p>The burning sensation on that bald spot was ridiculously strong. It felt like a hundred thousand Pikachus were dancing on it at the same time while putting a hundred thousand volts on it.</p>

    <p>"I've never heard of it." The demon spirit was also frightened.</p>

    <p>She and Jiugong Xinghui have been working together for many years. In order to seize the owner of {Ghost Book}, she entered Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>The main book {Ghost Book} contains the top ghosts that the Jiugong family has conquered all over the world over the years. If you can use hair to bind them all, you can use them for your own use.</p>

    <p>The strength of the demon spirit will also reach an unimaginable peak!</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, such a powerful ghost appeared now. This seemed to make the two of them confused for a while.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now?" Jiugong Xinghui originally thought that he was the one who was strategizing.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling's intervention suddenly made her feel flustered.</p>

    <p>"Don't be anxious. There is still room for maneuver..."</p>

    <p>The demon refused to give up. She felt that there might be a way to reverse the current situation: "That ghost named Houlang is indeed very strong."</p>

    <p>"But he also made a mistake... that is, he just chose to stop. There are two bald spots on the top of his head that are the size of fingernails. In fact, the damage to us is very small."</p>

    <p>"If we can get the main Ghost Book and absorb all the ghosts in the main book, he may not be our opponent."</p>

    <p>"you mean..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui frowned.</p>

    <p>The demon spirit sighed: "There is no other way. Although it is very risky. But in the current situation, we can only act in advance. As long as we can absorb the entire {Ghost Book}, we may be able to bring the one named Houlang with us." Ghost. Swallow it all together..."</p>

    <p>"Can I swallow it?!" Jiugong Xinghui's eyes brightened instantly.</p>

    <p>"Possibly."</p>

    <p>The Demon Spirit is confident: "If it is also swallowed by us. Not to mention on this Sun Island. My hair will be able to penetrate the world and even alien planets. And this will be the realization of our grand plan to control the world..."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>As the Hair Demon said, their actions are indeed risky.</p>

    <p>Over the years, she has been exploring ways to the underground seal at Jiugong's home.</p>

    <p>After so many years of exploration, Jiugong Xinghui believes that he has basically mastered the method of opening the underground sealed passage. There is about a 96% chance of success.</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, they set their big plan in three months.</p>

    <p>However, the appearance of Wang Ling was so sudden that they had to advance their plan.</p>

    <p>It's risky. But it's also a helpless move.</p>

    <p>That ghost named "Houlang" is a huge threat.</p>

    <p>God knows when the other party will choose to attack them?</p>

    <p>"How about it? Have you thought about it clearly?" At this time, the sharp voice of the haired demon sounded in her mind. She was still encouraging Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>After a long silence, Jiugong Xinghui finally nodded: "I understand."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because Yingxian Heming is around. Wang Ling continues to pull out his hair, which is actually a bit risky.</p>

    <p>I have no choice but to withdraw my hand temporarily.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the purpose of the warning has been achieved.</p>

    <p>It just lets these two people live a little longer...</p>

    <p>No matter what idea I have, Wang Ling feels that it is invalid.</p>

    <p>After all, the gap in strength is obvious.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry everyone. I have a lot of stock. I kept you waiting for a long time." Yingxian Heming was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>In fact, he has not completely released it yet. There is still some inventory left in his stomach.</p>

    <p>However, due to time constraints, Yingxian Heming realized that he could no longer drag it out like this.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, you will miss the best time to observe the sunrise.</p>

    <p>So Yingxian Heming came up with a quick wit. He used the third function of the anus besides defecation on the toilet: "the art of breaking feces"...interrupting his detoxification work.</p>

    <p>This looks like an interesting piece of writing.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the author is not in the water.</p>

    <p>But it will be helpful for readers with constipation when reading this paragraph.</p>

    <p>Able to make your mind happy.</p>

    <p>This produces the effect of detoxification and beauty.</p>

    <p>About more than an hour passed. Wang Ling The group finally arrived at the sunrise observation platform of Tiangan Mountain.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family made arrangements in advance and fully booked the observation platform.</p>

    <p>Best time, best place. No outsiders to interfere.</p>

    <p>"Please enjoy it quietly. I'm going to prepare breakfast."</p>

    <p>After taking everyone to the designated location, Yingxian Heming retreated very consciously.</p>

    <p>Go to a safe hut on the observation platform and prepare breakfast.</p>

    <p>He has put all the ingredients into the storage bag.</p>

    <p>Choosing this time to prepare breakfast was actually to leave enough space for the four young people.</p>

    <p>Although Yingxian Heming has issues with his sexual orientation, he is also a person who has been through it all.</p>

    <p>He respects everyone's likes and hopes that everyone can get the best love.</p>

    <p>At this time. Tiangan Mountain.</p>

    <p>The brilliance of the sun has risen. It peeks out from the distant sky little by little.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt the feeling of everything awakening from silence at this time. The feeling of dawn coming after darkness. The peace in his heart made him suddenly feel extremely comfortable.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stood beside Wang Ling, also looking ahead. The distance between the two seemed very close, but also seemed very far away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming wanted to step forward and tease Wang Ling. But this scene was so beautiful that the most noisy person actually calmed down at this moment.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin smiled slightly. He reached out and tugged on Wang Ming's sleeve. Then the two stood on the other side together, leaving the best sunrise observation angle to Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The sun has left the horizon. It is red.</p>

    <p>It moves upward slowly, passing through the clouds and mist in the distance. Like a beautiful agate plate, it illuminates everything brilliantly.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling..."Sun Rong opened his mouth, as if he wanted to say something to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his face slightly sideways. He looked at Sun Rong and made a gentle shushing gesture.</p>

    <p>The distance between the two of them is too close.</p>

    <p>That familiar breath came. Sun Rong couldn't help but feel his face getting hot.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to see it too..." Wang Ling started.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought this was talking to him. But then Wang Ling called out Jingke.</p>

    <p>Placed next to the railing of the mountaintop observation platform.</p>

    <p>She thought she had disturbed Wang Ling. She thought of retreating.</p>

    <p>Jingke suddenly poked his head out, stretched out his hand between them, and pulled the two of them together.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling is holding Jingke, and Jingke is holding Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>No unnecessary words.</p>

    <p>Only now. The most beautiful sunrise peace.</p>

    <p>The cool breeze accompanied by the red clouds shining in the distance dyed the faces of young girls crimson...</p>
