  <h1>Chapter 1474 Let's wear Hanfu together!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"That's awesome! It's really a key card... Can you get this kind of thing with instant noodles now?" Guo Hao exclaimed.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Li Youyue also stared at the glittering golden card with horrified eyes.</p>

    <p>In the past, what I drew in the simple noodles were either Water Margin cards, or assembled cards in cooperation with a certain anime IP...</p>

    <p>Regarding this, many people probably have special memories. After all, they are all children from that era.</p>

    <p>The snacks you spend money on can be wasted and not eaten. But the cards inside must be collected.</p>

    <p>Both Chen Chao and Guo Hao remember the enthusiasm they had when collecting the assembly cards of "Pants Pocket Monster."</p>

    <p>To this day, they still keep the collection of assembled cards safely in their cabinets.</p>

    <p>It's outrageous that a childhood snack can extract room cards...</p>

    <p>Now. Sun Rong finally knows how powerful Chen Chao's mouth opening is.</p>

    <p>It's obviously a joke. Who knows it will become reality.</p>

    <p>In a normal situation, how could you possibly get something like a room card?</p>

    <p>So you don't have to think about it to know. This must be Grandpa's masterpiece again...</p>

    <p>The scene became awkward for a time.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao, and Li Youyue's thoughts were all racing. They had all received "bribes" from Sun Rong. Breaking the embarrassment and secretly assisting were their main tasks.</p>

    <p>"Um...this card can be used as a gift for uncles and aunts. It seems good. Anyway, classmate Wang Ling is not bound yet, right? I think it requires scanning the code to activate. You can only activate it after registering with your identity verification name. "." Li Youyue said first.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling thinks this is indeed a good suggestion.</p>

    <p>He remembered that when the two of them were in love, they would often come to this ancient street.</p>

    <p>After Father Wang got married, it is said that it seemed that one day on Valentine's Day, the two of them revisited their old place and came here.</p>

    <p>And then. Mother Wang got pregnant with him...</p>

    <p>This ancient street.</p>

    <p>It is actually of extraordinary significance to Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that fortunately Li Youyue's thinking changes quickly.</p>

    <p>"It's good. My uncle and aunt will be very happy." So, Guo Hao continued.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Not bad, not bad. Maybe when uncle and aunt come here next time..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Guo Hao, Li Youyue: "Shut up!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>So. This matter was successfully fooled. Sun Rong breathed a sigh of relief...</p>

    <p>But she still wanted to ask what was going on.</p>

    <p>Grandpa, it's not like people who are so crooked would be interested in...</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, she took a photo of the room card and sent it directly to Boss Sun in a private message.</p>

    <p>Over there, Mr. Boss Sun also had a cold smile on his face after receiving the news.</p>

    <p>As expected of Rongrong. He noticed it so quickly...</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. Then he clicked on the picture sent by his precious granddaughter. His face turned dark immediately and he transferred the picture to the "Old Street Subcontracting Plan Working Group" temporarily formed by the group's senior management.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun: "I asked you to put the card in there... but I didn't ask you to put the room card! Who is causing this? Come out and admit it!"</p>

    <p>"I just said it's not a room key card. No one would put such a thing in snacks."</p>

    <p>"Hey, I knew it wasn't the key card. But old man, there's nothing we can do. Being a senior official is overwhelming!"</p>

    <p>"This is all Brother Jiang's idea!"</p>

    <p>The members of the group started to blame it one after another.</p>

    <p>The corners of Boss Sun's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>He knew what Jiang Xiaoche was up to again...</p>

    <p>So what does this kid want to do?</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling. Where did you offend him? What a helpful young man! What a cute dead fish eye!</p>

    <p>Although Mr. Boss Sun was puzzled, he was even a little angry.</p>

    <p>But after all, Jiang Xiaoche has been working under him for many years. He doesn't want to break up so quickly.</p>

    <p>We can only ask Jiang Xiaoche privately.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiang Xiaoche was clearly prepared: "Such an old man. That's what I think. Actually, this is a test. It's also a test for classmate Wang Ling, a vigorous adolescent boy. See What kind of reaction will there be after such a thing? Master, aren't you curious at all?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's words made Boss Sun fall into silence.</p>

    <p>After a long time, Sun Yiyuan frowned and said: "I don't think Wang Ling is such a person. Besides, judging from the current situation, Rongrong just has unrequited love. How could he have wrong thoughts."</p>

    <p>"You know people, faces, but not hearts, old man!" Jiang Xiaoche refused to give up.</p>

    <p>"So. Do you want to make a bet?" Boss Sun smiled.</p>

    <p>"Okay. What do you want to bet on, old man?"</p>

    <p>"If you lose. You are not allowed to cause trouble to Wang Ling and Rongrong anymore."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was silent. He nodded and said, "Okay. Deal."</p>

    <p>He knew that he had no choice.</p>

    <p>Although the old man spoke politely, he actually had hidden murderous intentions...</p>

    <p>This is actually a warning.</p>

    <p>Although Jiang Xiaoche is jealous of Wang Ling, he will not throw away his future and career just to confront Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just this time. If he loses...</p>

    <p>Between him and Sun Rong. There is no chance anymore.</p>

    <p>After the call ended, Jiang Xiaoche actually felt very complicated inside.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt a little hopeful that he could lose this bet.</p>

    <p>If that's the case...</p>

    <p>It should be able to completely cut off those undue thoughts about the eldest lady hidden deep in his heart.</p>

    <p>He actually knows very well that such an idea is unrealistic.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's time to honestly find someone who likes you equally, get married and have children as soon as possible, and let your life settle down...</p>

    <p>In the penthouse suite of Holiday Inn Gujie. Jiang Xiaoche was sitting on the sofa, thinking deeply.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the end of Qian Street, the ancient street. The most famous one is undoubtedly the most unique Hanfu experience store here.</p>

    <p>Before coming here, both Father Wang and Mother Wang strongly recommended Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Everyone came to this time-honored experience store. The store is actually not big, but there are a lot of customers coming and going.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a well-known time-honored brand.</p>

    <p>Dress up experience. The most excited people are always the girls.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue looked at the people walking out of the experience store. Her eyes were straight. She whispered to Sun Rong in a soft voice: "Rongrong. Did you see the cutest couple with the height difference in front of them?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I saw it!"</p>

    <p>"Doesn't it look good?"</p>

    <p>"Good-looking!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"This set of Hanfu is very famous. It is a couple's Hanfu featuring blue and mandarin duck patterns. It is very famous in the ancient streets." Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong felt like this guy was hinting at something to him again.</p>

    <p>She also wants to wear an outfit like this with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But that's not the kind of relationship between them...</p>

    <p>Looking at the couple in Hanfu in front of the door, the girl's eyes were full of envy.</p>

    <p>She quickly adjusted her thoughts. Then she stepped in first: "Let's go change into Hanfu together. Youyue and I will pick out clothes for you three boys first!"</p>

    <p>That's what he said.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is mainly for Wang Ling to choose.</p>

    <p>Just now when a group of them were at the entrance of the Hanfu store, Sun Rong took a look at the white Hanfu displayed in a sealed glass cabinet.</p>

    <p>White embroidered immortal crane suit. All embroidery patterns and patterns are made of gold thread.</p>

    <p>Pair it with a long red belt that is the finishing touch. It gives you an immortal feeling.</p>

    <p>She imagined how Wang Ling would look like wearing this Hanfu. Her face suddenly felt hot.</p>

    <p>"I think classmate Wang Ling looks good in this suit..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"This lady has good taste."</p>

    <p>At this time, in the Hanfu experience store, a man wearing linen clothes and dressed like a second brother came over: "I am the guide here. The full name of the Hanfu that the lady just took a fancy to is Izumo Bengyue."</p>

    <p>As he said this, he glanced at Wang Ling with a smile: "How about it? Does this classmate Wang want to try it?"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue and others thought that Wang Ling would not compromise so easily. They all began to prepare words of persuasion.</p>

    <p>The result was beyond everyone's expectation. Wang Ling actually agreed directly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Okay..."</p>

    <p>Brother Xiaoer's smile never diminished: "Brother, please follow me to the men's changing area over there. We have someone to change it for you."</p>

    <p>Take more pictures.</p>

    <p>This is the task assigned to him by Mother Wang...</p>

    <p>It is important to complete the task.</p>

    <p>It's just a change of clothes.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later.</p>

    <p>With the help of the Hanfu store staff, Wang Ling successfully put on this "Izumo and the Moon" suit and walked out of the locker room.</p>

    <p>Just a moment...</p>

    <p>The originally bustling Hanfu experience store seemed to have frozen even in the air. For a time, countless eyes fell on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>They didn't know who the man in white Hanfu was.</p>

    <p>But that kind of immortal energy and vigorous youthful feeling instantly attracted the attention of everyone here...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared intently at the brand-new boy in front of him.</p>

    <p>As if in the stagnant space, the pounding heartbeat beat rhythmically in the girl's heart.</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Sun Rong felt a little selfish,</p>

    <p>He actually wanted to secretly hide the young man in front of him in his pocket.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>You are indeed. My treasure...</p>
