  <h1>Chapter 2144 The Four Elephants</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the second person was eliminated with a headshot, the Immortal Sword players began to realize that the two level 1 players they encountered were not ordinary level 1 players. Instead, they were two self-propelled humanoid plug-ins.</p>

    <p>Just based on his feeling, he completed a headshot at level 1 by using a sniper and a blind sniper. If the possibility of software plug-ins is ruled out, it proves that this player in reality is a sniper who can skillfully operate a sniper rifle.</p>

    <p>This is a human physics plug-in. Otherwise, such accuracy would never be possible.</p>

    <p>The game world of Itinerant Immortal has always been very strict about cheating. Therefore, it is basically impossible to have software cheats. It strictly maintains the fair order of the game world. This is also one of the main points that many players admire about the game Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>As an old sword immortal player, this level 12 feudal sword immortal is just Li Ziye's trumpet. He has met many high-end players. Many old players can perform outrageous actions at low levels in the game world without any worries. strangeness.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye could find 10,000 reasons to convince himself that Xiang Yi might be a walking physics plug-in. But no matter what, he couldn't figure out what was going on with Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>This doesn't mean it's cheating, right?</p>

    <p>It's just a matter of probability!</p>

    <p>The problem is that the sealing spell of his sealing sword Immortal has a 65% sealing probability. It actually missed 5 times in a row!</p>

    <p>Damn, I really saw a ghost!</p>

    <p>Even more outrageous, Li Ziye also discovered that his mana was almost running out... Sealing spells consume a lot of mana. Although Li Ziye had selected the passive skill "Calm and Composed," which would refund 60% of the mana cost of the skill as long as the seal hit.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. He didn't hit even once!</p>

    <p>Li Ziye almost cried. He saw everyone around him being sniped one by one. The initial domineering smile on his face was no longer there.</p>

    <p>He knew he had kicked a hornet's nest. A fully-equipped, intelligent, sealing-type sword immortal, while not entirely without lethality, still made Li Ziye hesitant to directly attack Xiang Yi and Qin Zong.</p>

    <p>These two are too strange; their actions don't seem like those of novice players at all. So Li Ziye is also wondering if Qin Zong and Xiang Yi have other accounts.</p>

    <p>If he takes action now, is there any possibility of retaliation in the future?</p>

    <p>Although the game world is vast, top-tier players have a lot of items, making it incredibly easy for them to mobilize their power and find someone. Eliminating someone is as easy as crushing an ant.</p>

    <p>"Wait! No more fighting! Stop it!" In desperation, Li Ziye made a decision. He called on the other frightened players around him to put down their weapons.</p>

    <p>But even so, this decision was obviously too late, because while Li Ziye was thinking about it, Xiang Yi blindly sniped three more people, and... all of them had their heads shot.</p>

    <p>In other words, Li Ziye's original team of ten people now has only five left.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Li Ziye had taken the initiative to show his kindness, Qin Zhong also winked and signaled Xiang Yi to stop shooting their heads.</p>

    <p>The shooting feel and recoil of this sniper rifle are too real. There is not much difference between it and reality. Xiang Yi quite enjoys the feeling of this headshot.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong? Didn't you say you want to kill us all?" Qin Zhong crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He and Xiang Yi were both people who had seen big scenes. The postures the two people put up made Li Ziye's cheeks sweat. It made him even more convinced that these two people were definitely not novice players! And there must be a big player behind them!</p>

    <p>"Admitting defeat in time is the way to cut your losses. I guess I was blind to your abilities. Gentlemen, you have a larger account, right? It's a misunderstanding! It's all a misunderstanding!"</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said with a smile: "This is the game world. It's a dog-eat-dog world. When I see you walking on the street with a huge sum of money in your pocket, who can't be a bit cautious?"</p>

    <p>This was true. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi looked at each other in confusion.</p>

    <p>Then Qin Zhong looked at Li Ziye and asked: "It's like you said. Normal people would be a little bit suspicious of us. But it seems a little wrong that you are the only one who robbed me."</p>

    <p>"You two may not know this, but these are the rules of Mechanical City. You may be new to this profession, but I have a main character who is a Mechanic, so I am more or less familiar with the map here and the unwritten rules among players."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said: "There are indeed many people who want to rob you. But there are rules. In a civilized society, we must use civilized robbery methods. If we fail, others will target you later."</p>

    <p>"How is the order determined?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>"This is very simple. Just roll the dice. Three dice. The one with the higher number is given priority. It continues the rules of forming a group to fight a dungeon."</p>

    <p>"No wonder. That's why I said there was murderous intent outside, but they didn't attack," Xiang Yi couldn't help but murmured in a low voice when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He opened his mouth and asked Li Ziye: "You guys didn't come up with the rules of this Machinery City, right?"</p>

    <p>"It was initially funded by a guild called Four Elephants Clan, and then it continued." Li Ziye said.</p>

    <p>Four elephants.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong muttered the name.</p>

    <p>It always sounds a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>Soon the memories came to his mind quickly.</p>

    <p>He heard Lord Diulei talk about this sect.</p>

    <p>And it actually exists in the real world.</p>

    <p>This is the branch that evolved from the Wuji Sword Sect founded by Jian Immortal Fan Rui. It is called Si Xiang Zhong. The founder of Si Xiang Zhong is actually the disciple of Jian Immortal Fan Rui. And most of these disciples are from the Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>With such a crooked master, his disciples are naturally not much better. Now everyone in Sixiang is a real S-class wanted criminal.</p>

    <p>Now Evil Sword God is still serving his sentence in Songhai City Number 1 Prison. the Four Elephants had previously launched a notice against Songhai City Number 1 Prison, saying that they would directly rob the prison and rescue Evil Sword God. But so far, they have not done so.</p>

    <p>So now Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are thinking about a question.</p>

    <p>That is the guild in the game called Four Elephants. Is it possible that it was founded by the fugitive members of Four Elephants?</p>

    <p>Because the behavior patterns are really similar. But Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi currently have no evidence at all.</p>

    <p>Of course, we do not rule out the possibility of fans of the Four Elephants establishing a guild in the game.</p>

    <p>That's right. Although the Four Elephants have done many evil things, they still have fans. And this kind of organization that symbolizes rebellion and distortion can usually attract a group of die-hard fans who are willing to spend money and cover for it.</p>

    <p>The International Cultivation Police Department previously suspected that it was these fans who had provided cover for the members of the Four Elephants, which was why they had not been able to catch them.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. I wonder if the two great gods can cooperate?" At this time, Li Ziye said: "You just pretend to have been robbed by me. In this case, others will not stare at you. You don't need to hand it over. Just leave that blue sniper rifle to us for safekeeping temporarily."</p>

    <p>"Then this is too fake." Qin Zhong sighed.</p>

    <p>He knew Li Ziye's plan.</p>

    <p>But he and Xiang Yi are both veterans. How could they be deceived so easily?</p>

    <p>At this time, Qin Zhong patted Xiang Yi on the shoulder and said to Li Ziye: "Look, what level is my friend?"</p>

    <p>"Shit! Why is this level 7?"</p>

    <p>"I killed five of you. will be upgraded directly."</p>

    <p>Leap level counter-attack. This directly improved Xiang Yi's character experience.</p>

    <p>And that's not even the most outrageous thing.</p>

    <p>Because Li Ziye discovered that Qin Zhong had also been upgraded.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye was shocked: "Why have you reached level 5..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "I gained experience on the sidelines. So I reached level 5."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye: "..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong Tan Tanshou: "So in this situation, you can't make demands of us. Instead, we should be the ones telling you what to do."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye: "..."</p>
