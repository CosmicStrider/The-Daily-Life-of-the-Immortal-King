  <h1>Chapter 2144 4 Elephants</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the second person was eliminated with a headshot, the Immortal Sword began to realize that the two level 1 players he encountered were not ordinary level 1 players. Instead, they were two self-propelled humanoid plug-ins.</p>

    <p>Just based on his feeling, he completed a headshot at level 1 by using a sniper and a blind sniper. If the possibility of software plug-ins is ruled out, it proves that this player in reality is a sniper who can skillfully operate a sniper rifle.</p>

    <p>This is a human physics plug-in. Otherwise, such accuracy would never be possible.</p>

    <p>The game world of Itinerant Immortal has always been very strict about cheating. Therefore, it is basically impossible to have software cheats. It strictly maintains the fair order of the game world. This is also one of the main points that many players admire about the game Itinerant Immortal. one.</p>

    <p>As an old sword immortal player, this level 12 feudal sword immortal is just Li Ziye's trumpet. He has met many high-end players. Many old players can perform outrageous actions at low levels in the game world without any worries. strangeness.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye could find 10,000 reasons to convince himself that Xiang Yi might be a walking physics plug-in. But no matter what, he couldn't figure out what was going on with Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>This doesn't mean it's cheating, right?</p>

    <p>It's just a matter of probability!</p>

    <p>The problem is that the sealing spell of his sealing sword Immortal has a 65% sealing probability. It actually missed 5 times in a row!</p>

    <p>Damn, I really saw a ghost!</p>

    <p>What's even more outrageous is that Li Ziye also found that he was almost out of mana... The consumption of sealing spells was already huge. Although Li Ziye ordered the passive skill of "Calm and Calm", it can be refunded as long as the seal hits. The skill costs 60% mana.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. He didn't hit even once!</p>

    <p>Li Ziye almost cried. He saw everyone around him being sniped one by one. The initial domineering and smile on his face was no longer there.</p>

    <p>He knew that he was stepping on the wall. It was an immortal sword with full intelligence. Although it was not without any lethality, under such circumstances, Li Ziye still did not dare to attack Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong directly.</p>

    <p>These two people are so weird. It doesn't look like the operations of a novice player. So Li Ziye is also thinking about whether Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi still have large numbers.</p>

    <p>If I take action now, is there any possibility of retaliation in the future?</p>

    <p>Although the game world is large, boss-level players have many props. It is too easy to find someone to mobilize their power. Squeezing someone out is like squeezing out an ant.</p>

    <p>"Wait! No more fighting! Stop it!" In desperation, Li Ziye made a decision. He called on the other frightened players around him to put down their weapons.</p>

    <p>But even so, this decision was obviously too late, because while Li Ziye was thinking about it, Xiang Yi blindly sniped three more people, and... all of them had their heads shot.</p>

    <p>In other words, Li Ziye's original team of ten people now has only five left.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Li Ziye had taken the initiative to show his kindness, Qin Zhong also winked and signaled Xiang Yi to stop shooting his head.</p>

    <p>The shooting feel and recoil of this sniper rifle are too real. There is not much difference between it and reality. Xiang Yi quite enjoys the feeling of this headshot.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong? Didn't you say you want to kill us all?" Qin Zhong crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He and Xiang Yi were both people who had seen big scenes. The postures the two people put up made Li Ziye's cheeks sweat. It made him even more convinced that these two people were definitely not novice players! And there must be a big player behind them!</p>

    <p>"Giving up in time is the only way to stop losses. I'm blind to the truth. The two eldest brothers have big sizes, right? Misunderstanding! This is all a misunderstanding!"</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said with a smile: "This is the game world. The jungle is strong. When I see you walking on the street with a huge sum of money in your pocket, who can't be a bit cautious?"</p>

    <p>This was true. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi looked at each other in confusion.</p>

    <p>Then Qin Zhong looked at Li Ziye and asked: "It's like you said. Normal people would be a little bit suspicious of us. But it seems a little wrong that you are the only one who robbed me."</p>

    <p>"You two don't know. These are the rules in the Mechanical City. You may have just come into contact with this profession. But I have a big one who is a mechanic. So there are unwritten rules between the map here and the players. Or more Or at least familiar with it."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said: "There are indeed many people who want to rob you. But there are rules. In a civilized society, we must use civilized robbery methods. If we fail, others will target you later."</p>

    <p>"How is the order determined?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>"This is very simple. Just roll the dice. Three dice. The one with the higher number is given priority. It continues the rules of forming a group to fight a dungeon."</p>

    <p>"No wonder. I said there is murderous intent outside, but I don't attack in. The reason is this." Xiang Yi couldn't help but murmured in a low voice when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He opened his mouth and asked Li Ziye: "You guys didn't come up with the rules of this Machinery City, right?"</p>

    <p>"It was originally saved by a guild called Sixiangzhong. Later it was continued." Li Ziye said.</p>

    <p>Four elephants.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong muttered the name.</p>

    <p>It always sounds a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>Soon the memories came to his mind quickly.</p>

    <p>He heard Lord Diuleipu talk about this sect.</p>

    <p>And it actually exists in the real world.</p>

    <p>This is the branch that evolved from the Wuji Sword Sect founded by Jian Immortal Fan Rui. It is called Si Xiang Zhong. The founder of Si Xiang Zhong is actually the disciple of Jian Immortal Fan Rui. And most of these disciples are from the evil Jian Shen. disciple.</p>

    <p>With such a crooked master, his disciples are naturally not much better. Now everyone in Sixiang is a real S-class wanted criminal.</p>

    <p>Now Evil Jian Shen is still serving his sentence in Songhai City Number 1 Prison. Sixiangzhong had previously launched a notice against Songhai City Number 1 Prison, saying that they would directly rob the prison and rescue Evil Jian Shen. But so far, they have not done so. A movement.</p>

    <p>So now Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are thinking about a question.</p>

    <p>That is the guild in the game called Four Elephants. Is it possible that it was founded by the fugitive members of Four Elephants?</p>

    <p>Because the behavior patterns are really similar. But Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi currently has no evidence at all.</p>

    <p>Of course, we do not rule out the possibility of fans of Sixiangzhong establishing a guild in the game.</p>

    <p>That's right. Although the Four Elephants have done many evil things, they still have fans. And this kind of organization that symbolizes rebellion and distortion can usually attract a group of die-hard fans who are willing to spend money and cover for it.</p>

    <p>The International Cultivation Police Department previously suspected that it was these fans who had provided cover for the members of the Four Elephants, which was why they had not been able to catch them.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. I wonder if the two great gods can cooperate?" At this time, Li Ziye said: "You just pretend to have been robbed by me. In this case, others will not stare at you. You don't need to hand it over. Money. Just leave that blue sniper rifle to us for safekeeping temporarily."</p>

    <p>"Then this is too fake." Qin Zhong sighed.</p>

    <p>He knew Li Ziye's plan.</p>

    <p>But he and Xiang Yi are both veterans. How could they be deceived so easily?</p>

    <p>At this time, Qin Zhong patted Xiang Yi on the shoulder and said to Li Ziye: "Look, what level is my friend?"</p>

    <p>"Shit! Why is this level 7?"</p>

    <p>"I killed five of you. will be upgraded directly."</p>

    <p>Leap level counter-attack. This directly improved Xiang Yi's character experience.</p>

    <p>And that's not even the most outrageous thing.</p>

    <p>Because Li Ziye discovered that Qin Zhong had also been upgraded.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye was shocked: "Why have you reached level 5..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "I gained experience on the sidelines. So I reached level 5."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye: "..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong Tan Tanshou: "So in this situation, you can't make demands on us. It should be that we tell you what to do."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye: "..."</p>
