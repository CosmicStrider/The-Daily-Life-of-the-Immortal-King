  <h1>Chapter 2030 Parasites in the Belly of Whales</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect Mr. Boss Sun to get involved in this matter. He thought that he and Sun Rong, Immortal Toya's actions were quite secretive.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Boss Sun happened to remember Sun Rong. So he used the Sun family's spiritual power monitoring equipment to detect the spiritual power of Sun Rong, and found his way to the bottom of the sea.</p>

    <p>This is not Sun Yiyuan's intention to monitor. Just like sometimes the elders in the family suddenly think of you and suddenly send you a WeChat message asking where you are and what you are doing. It is just a sign of missing you.</p>

    <p>After learning that Sun Rong's spiritual power signal appeared in the East Huaxiu Sea, the old man's first reaction was not to blame Sun Rong for going looking for the Sun family's ancestral land without saying hello. Instead, he was worried that his granddaughter had been deceived by someone. Or maybe he was kidnapped by someone and forced to enter the East Huaxiu Sea.</p>

    <p>Parents have always had a strong ability to think things over. This is especially true for parents who are known to protect their children.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the Sun family. With this ancestral brain power, Mr. Boss Sun had already written an entire novel in his mind on the way to the East Huaxiu Sea.</p>

    <p>Although Mr. Boss Sun is here, it will be inconvenient to move. Fortunately, with the help of the old man, Wang Ling can follow Mr. Boss Sun to find the ancient whale safely without harming other marine life.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, do you have any way to contact the senior ancient whale?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Senior ancient whales can be summoned using specific sound wave signals. It's just like Morse code. Moreover, this kind of spell has been studied and passed down from generation to generation by the ancestor of my Sun family. The sound waves it emits are unusual. If you don't reach the realm, Human ears cannot distinguish it. But the ancient whale seniors can hear it."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan explained: "But in the past, when I summoned the senior ancient whale, it was always above the sea. After it appeared, it would swallow me directly. It's the first time I summoned the ancient whale at the bottom of the sea."</p>

    <p>The old man said. Then he closed his eyes gently. All he saw was the flower in his hand.</p>

    <p>After changing several complex seals and seals in succession, Mr. Boss Sun put his sword fingers together against his temples. At the same time, his lips began to tremble slightly and released a high-frequency sound wave.</p>

    <p>Soon. In the depths of the ocean, Wang Ling heard a strange rhythmic sound.</p>

    <p>It couldn't be said to be the roar of the spirit whale. Rather, it was the sound emitted by the ancient whale's body that was responding to Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>A behemoth is like a giant island hidden under the sea. When the huge body floats up, its huge shadow directly rolls up the endless sea water.</p>

    <p>Those huge sword whales were eclipsed by such an astonishing size. Then Wang Ling saw the submarine they were riding in. The electronic screen in front of them went black. It was actually swallowed directly by this ancient whale. Entered the stomach.</p>

    <p>When the screen returned to brightness, what suddenly appeared in front of us was the entrance to Shiwandashan, the ancestral land of the Sun family! It was as magnificent as the scene seen before on a bright moonlit night. It was like a retreat.</p>

    <p>The core world was cultivated within the body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw this scene in front of him. He instantly understood what was going on.</p>

    <p>He put his hands in his trouser pockets and shook them with his fingers. The formation of the {Great Blood Origin Technique} was completed.</p>

    <p>"How about it. Does Ling Zhenren know the origin of this ancient whale?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya asked during the team communication technique.</p>

    <p>"Um."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. He responded briefly and concisely: "It's a mixed-race Kun."</p>

    <p>Just as he had guessed, this creature used {Big Skin Technique} to disguise itself as the East Huaxiu Sea Spirit Whale. It was a hybrid Kun. It was not even an ancient whale in the true sense. Although there was a small amount in the body of this hybrid Kun. Divine Whale Bloodline. But from the general direction of the bloodline, theoretically speaking, it should be more appropriate to call it Gu Kun!</p>

    <p>Hybrid Kun. Wang Ling can actually relate to it. But he didn't expect that the bloodline complexity of the hybrid Kun in front of him was far more terrifying than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Among the seven or forty-nine bloodlines, except for one which is the bloodline of the Divine Whale, the remaining forty-eight bloodlines include almost all the bloodlines of the Kun divine beasts bred in today's chaos.</p>

    <p>So it is obvious that this senior ancient whale does not naturally possess these bloodline powers.</p>

    <p>It was created artificially a long, long time ago. And the ancestor of the Sun family obviously did not have such an ability.</p>

    <p>The only explanation is that there must be a connection between this ancient whale senior and Dao Ancestor Wang! And there may also be a fateful connection between the ancestor of the Sun family and Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling speculates. Maybe the founder of the Sun family does not know the true identity of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>After all, a monk can play so many characters in so many reincarnations and experience the impermanence of the world. Dao Ancestor Wang wants to play other people. Naturally, it is not difficult.</p>

    <p>After everyone got off the submarine.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan looked in the four directions of southeast, northwest, and bowed to each other. He said: "This junior, I am taking my granddaughter, two friends, and an outsider to visit the ancestral land. I have disturbed the senior. I hope senior Gu Jing will forgive me. Mr. Canghu. Just a moment." I will stay on the submarine to visit my family in the future. The range of activities is limited to a radius of three kilometers. I will not enter the Shiwanshan Mountain of my grand family."</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu: "..."</p>

    <p>This was already the Nth critical hit he had received in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>As a rigorous science popularizer, Mr. Canghu has never felt so out of place.</p>

    <p>But this is the ancestral land of the Sun family after all. He has a bad relationship with Sun Yiyuan. It is normal for him not to be qualified to enter.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Yiyuan only gave him a three-kilometer radius centered on the submarine, Mr. Canghu felt it was enough. After all, his purpose from the beginning was not to go to the Sun family's ancestral land. He just wanted to study it in depth. Take a look at this prehistoric whale.</p>

    <p>Now, not only did he find this prehistoric whale with his own eyes, but he also swallowed it directly into his stomach. For Mr. Canghu, even if he can't find anything later, his trip was already worthwhile.</p>

    <p>"Sorry for disturbing Senior Ancient Whale." Sun Rong also followed Sun Yiyuan in clasping his fists and saluting. She originally thought that Senior Ancient Whale would respond with specific sound waves.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, a voice suddenly reached everyone's ears. It was an ancient whale communicating with them in human language. Unexpectedly, the voice of this ancient whale senior was not only solemn and deep, but also very magnetic. It's that kind of magnetic subwoofer: "Friends?"</p>

    <p>Just two words. Boss Sun immediately reacted: "The pharmacist behind you is the descendant of Laojun. As for this classmate Wang, I have known him for a long time. Is there any problem with the senior?"</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan originally thought that the ancient whale would have some objections to Wang Ling's arrival, so he was very worried.</p>

    <p>As a result, the next second, the ancient whale senior actually replied with something he couldn't understand: "I don't dare..."</p>

    <p>Don't dare to have it?</p>

    <p>What does this mean...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was confused.</p>

    <p>Before he could think about it carefully, he heard Senior Ancient Whale speak again: "There are insects in my belly."</p>

    <p>"Are there insects mixed in?"</p>

    <p>These words immediately alerted Sun Yiyuan: "Senior, what you mean is that someone has already entered the ancestral land of my Sun family?"</p>

    <p>He was shocked. He didn't expect that a real outsider would sneak into the Sun family's ancestral land!</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Wang Ling seemed very calm about the matter.</p>

    <p>He could guess who the person who sneaked in was.</p>

    <p>And he has already captured the aura of Mingyue Ye.</p>
