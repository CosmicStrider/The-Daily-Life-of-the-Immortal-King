  <h1>Chapter 2021 The mysterious signal from the center of the earth and the place of sacrifice</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Became... grandma?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Immortal Toya couldn't help but look at each other in confusion.</p>

    <p>Then Immortal Toya really couldn't hold back the desire to complain in his heart. He looked at Sun Rong and laughed: "Maybe Miss Sun also wants me and Ling Zhenren to get into it by mistake. But Miss Sun has to think about it. In our country of cultivation, polyandry is impossible. You have to choose well..."</p>

    <p>This was a joke. It was teasing and hinting. Sun Rong immediately blushed upon hearing this.</p>

    <p>She repeatedly waved her hands and vetoed: "No... I didn't think so! Senior, please don't make fun of me! I just want to help you..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, that's what she said, but in her heart she was still looking forward to it.</p>

    <p>Regarding the relationship between her grandparents. Sun Rong actually doesn't know much about it.</p>

    <p>And sometimes she once suspected that when her grandma mistakenly entered the Sun family's ancestral land. Maybe it was the result of grandpa's deliberate guidance.</p>

    <p>Because after grandma was rescued, Sun Rong knew that the relationship between the two began to heat up rapidly.</p>

    <p>Of course. The above gossip was all heard by Sun Rong from her second grandfather who lived in seclusion all year round and rarely smiled.</p>

    <p>It is said that the subsequent emotional development of the two people was unusually smooth. Her grandfather seemed to have laid a dragnet so that her grandmother had nowhere to escape.</p>

    <p>Finally, they came together.</p>

    <p>Faced with such a powerful attack, it seems that no one can withstand the test.</p>

    <p>As for the Sun family, they have always been the ones taking the initiative to attack!</p>

    <p>If you meet someone you like, you will express your feelings directly and clearly!</p>

    <p>This also includes the time when her grandfather chased her grandmother.</p>

    <p>But when it came to Sun Rong, she began to have some doubts about life...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group Building. Sun Yiyuan stood in front of a mirror and was arranging his clothes. After checking the overall look, the stylist beside him left the office with his team with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, Jiang Xiaoche, who had been waiting outside for a long time, pushed in and said, "Sir, the Songhai City Cultivator Representative Association has determined the time. It will be held at noon the day after tomorrow."</p>

    <p>"What about the content of the meeting? Is there any announcement?" Sun Yiyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right. The content of this meeting is to discuss the sustainable development of the Earth Center Project."</p>

    <p>"Just this?"</p>

    <p>"There is also the issue of the mysterious signals sent from the center of the earth... The higher-ups plan to also pass this meeting to understand the thoughts of the representatives. Here is a detailed report." Jiang Xiaoche handed over the folder in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, this matter is not groundless."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan sighed. He frowned. He seemed to have known about this for a long time.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche stood aside, not daring to say anything. With Sun Yiyuan's status in the world of cultivation, it would be easy to find out some information.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan had heard about the mysterious signal before. It was a rumor he heard from a friend at the Academy of Sciences.</p>

    <p>According to the existing evidence, although the mysterious signal came from the center of the earth, after data monitoring and analysis, it was found that the source of the signal was actually an alien signal from an extraterrestrial civilization... And this mysterious alien signal Signal. Compare with all existing alien databases from Guo Ping. None of them can compare.</p>

    <p>Then we can draw two conclusions by classifying this matter.</p>

    <p>First. The earth's inner earth world. Humans are not the first race to explore. Long before human cultivators, alien beings have entered and hidden in the inner earth world. Although according to existing scientific methods. Before entering the inner earth world, no signals related to alien creatures had been detected.</p>

    <p>Second. There are wormholes leading to alien planets deep in the earth's inner world.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan believes that the second possibility is the highest.</p>

    <p>But no matter which inference it is, the risks brought by traveling to the inner earth world will be greatly increased.</p>

    <p>After all, it won't be long before the elite teams of young cultivators selected from various countries will enter the inner earth world and compete in a safe area that has been calculated.</p>

    <p>This matter has been planned for a long time. Now they received this mysterious signal...</p>

    <p>So. Should they respond to this mysterious signal?</p>

    <p>After looking at the information, Sun Yiyuan put the folder on the table. He rubbed his eyebrows with a slight headache: "By the way. Where is Rongrong? I just sent her a message. She didn't reply to me either."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche quickly turned on his watch. He looked at the electronic map and said, "Sir, the lady's spiritual power signal was detected near Donghai, Songhai City."</p>

    <p>"East Huaxiu Sea?" Sun Yiyuan laughed: "Nine times out of ten, she went to play at Palm Cliff. She went there several times during these days."</p>

    <p>"It's not necessarily Master of Palm Cliff. The lady's location is far away from Palm Cliff. To be precise, the current lady should be on the sea..."</p>

    <p>"On the sea?" Upon hearing this, Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but feel a drop of cold sweat on his cheek.</p>

    <p>"Master... what's wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No. It's okay..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan looked at Jiang Xiaoche: "Xiaoche. Regarding my afternoon schedule, please help me cancel it. Now I have some personal matters to deal with."</p>

    <p>"But the afternoon schedule is very important, sir. This is the annual joint reception for entrepreneurs in the cultivation world. This year, our Huaguo Shuilian Group has signed strategic cooperation agreements with the Office of Strategic Deception and the Jiugong family. It will definitely be the focus."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. It's all trivial." Sun Yiyuan wiped his hands with a handkerchief: "Go find the second master and ask him if he is willing to go. If he is unwilling to go, Xiaoche, you can participate on my behalf."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was flattered. Seeing Sun Yiyuan's firm attitude, he didn't dare to say anything more. He had no choice but to agree: "Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>A while ago, he made many mistakes and acted arrogantly. So during this period, he kept to himself and became very down-to-earth and peaceful.</p>

    <p>This time was a chance. Jiang Xiaoche felt that if he could perform well, he might be able to restore his image in Sun Yiyuan's mind.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. On the other side.</p>

    <p>The Sun family's sacrificial place is near the East Huaxiu Sea. When the three of them rushed here, Wang Ling found that the area in this area happened to cover the palm that he accidentally made when he rescued Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The blue waves are surging on the endless sea. The sunny weather adds a touch of warmth to the East Huaxiu Sea today. The entire sea surface is sparkling. From time to time, there are spiritual fish jumping up, showing a natural and harmonious atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. used King's Eyes to explore the seabed in this area. It was found that there was no other abnormality.</p>

    <p>So that means the entrance to the Sun family's ancestral land may be under the sea?</p>

    <p>His King's Eyes have the ability to distinguish all illusions. If there is an illusion trap near the East Huaxiu Sea, it will be useless. It will be easily resolved by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Maybe. Is it some other means?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a hypothesis in his mind.</p>

    <p>Because he deduced that the ancestor of the Sun family was Dao Ancestor Wang himself. So if this is the case, Dao Ancestor Wang might use his own methods to reconstruct the entrance to the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>If this is indeed the method used by Dao Ancestor Wang, then it cannot be deduced using normal earth cultivation knowledge...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that maybe he should consider the problem from another angle.</p>
