  <h1>Chapter 2163 Bravely Play Strategy Stream</h1>

  <div>

    <p>See Sun Rong to make up your mind. Only then did Lao Huang smile.</p>

    <p>Yes. His plan succeeded.</p>

    <p>Although Lao Huang wasn't very old, as an adult who had already experienced several relationships, how could he not see through Sun Rong's little scheme?</p>

    <p>And Lao Huang actually knew it well. He felt that this Fuyun Town general... was probably a real person, not an NPC.</p>

    <p>But Lao Huang suffered from the lack of any evidence.</p>

    <p>Just because the player who played the NPC general was so dedicated, Lao Huang once suspected that this person either graduated from the acting department or the directing department.</p>

    <p>This is so life-changing!</p>

    <p>"Alas, what a pity. Since Miss Sun has decided to go for it, then I will not take what is meant to be hers." Lao Huang shrugged and sighed.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong has made up her mind, she still feels a little uneasy inside.</p>

    <p>Not all players can master the strategy flow. Those who can use the method of strategy to break out in the game world of Itinerant Immortal are very mature galgame players.</p>

    <p>They are often well versed in strategies. They will understand how to operate the behavioral logic of game NPCs and deduce how to use game mechanisms to gain as much favor as possible from a certain NPC.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had also played similar games, including the recently popular mobile game "Love and Paper Dolls." However, compared to other visual novel games, these mobile games usually allow players to increase affection levels through in-game purchases...</p>

    <p>In the game world of Itinerant Immortal Magic Circle, Sun Rong, despite having immense martial prowess, faces the challenge of gaining the general's favor.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels a little troubled by this.</p>

    <p>"Those who are barefoot are not afraid of those who wear shoes. Sometimes if you think too much, it may not be a good thing."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Huang comforted Sun Rong and said: "Our logical thinking cannot be compared with professional strategy players. So it is completely meaningless to think about what strategy techniques they use."</p>

    <p>"So Lao Huang, what you mean is..."</p>

    <p>"Be spontaneous, follow your heart."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said: "Our current position is Wolong Recruitment Officer. The general of Fuyun Town also gave you the authority to manage Fuyun Town on his behalf. So I have a hunch that the basic value of his favorability towards you should not be low. Maybe you can be a little more reckless."</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, has anything happened between you and him before? To directly delegate the power of the town to a novice player. This is also a bit outrageous."</p>

    <p>She has to say. Lao Huang's words suddenly awakened Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"By the way... I helped him take care of the children in the house and teach them lessons..."</p>

    <p>"No wonder."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang clapped his hands: "If that's the case, then it makes sense. As a father, not earning money to support the family is not the most troublesome part, but taking care of children and helping them with their homework! I have quite a few friends who have literally broken their golden cores while tutoring their children."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that Lao Huang would have such an experience like speaking out from his own experience.</p>

    <p>And with the in-depth communication with Lao Huang, although Lao Huang did not directly tell what kind of work he was engaged in in the real world, Sun Rong could more or less feel a bit of Lao Huang's maturity. The image of young social animals.</p>

    <p>He should be in his early thirties. He is more than ten years older than her and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The occupation he is engaged in does not conflict with staying at home. Therefore, it may be an Internet-related occupation such as a programmer.</p>

    <p>After getting in touch with Lao Huang, she found that Lao Huang was a very cheerful and open-minded person, just like a little sun.</p>

    <p>Such a personality is very infectious to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>If it were possible, Sun Rong would really like to meet Lao Huang in the real world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has a social fear.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang is another social cow.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that if in the real world, Lao Huang's existence might also affect Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. After returning to the game world, Wang Ling checked his data panel immediately.</p>

    <p>Character attribute values. Wang Ling no longer cares about it at all. Because there is a god-level skill that can change destiny. Wang Ling can easily achieve attribute reversal through level deficit.</p>

    <p>At this moment, what he really cares about is his health bar.</p>

    <p>During the time he was away, the intelligent AI arranged by Wang Ming repeated his pattern of chanting mantras and helped him increase his health bar from the previous 100 million to 200 million.</p>

    <p>How long had he been gone? He actually gained 100 million more blood by relying on AI...</p>

    <p>How does this intelligent AI do it?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling imagined the scene of the AI silently reading the formula. Feeling that there must be quite a lot of ghostly elements in it. Otherwise, it would never be possible to achieve such an effect.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, Wang Ling is quite satisfied with the current situation. Because of the existence of intelligent AI, Wang Ling has not been interrupted much.</p>

    <p>He just didn't know if Sun Rong and Lao Huang had any suspicions about him while he was away.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the General's Mansion, Wang Ling woke up from a state of sitting cross-legged and dozing.</p>

    <p>He was still working hard to play the role of the general of Fuyun Town. He was about to get up and go to the Wolong Recruitment Office to see the situation on the spot.</p>

    <p>A familiar figure suddenly appeared in front of him outside the main hall.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>This is not the time to report on work.</p>

    <p>So she came here for other matters?</p>

    <p>Or... Sun Rong has already noticed the truth?</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Wang Ling's expression no longer looked so calm. Although it was only a subtle change, it was undeniable that there were some micro-expressions on this paralyzed face.</p>

    <p>The emotional constraints in the real world make Wang Ling's emotional response less sensitive. But this is a game. The virtual game world will give the most realistic response through the player's nervous system.</p>

    <p>In other words, even though Wang Ling does not have any emotional reactions in the real world, the game system can directly present emotions into the game world by capturing nerves.</p>

    <p>Various emotional reactions in the game world. Some of them are neural capture assistance on the system side.</p>

    <p>So the moment Wang Ling saw her, he didn't know what Sun Rong was here for. Wang Ling suddenly felt a little panicked.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a drop of sweat slid down the cheek under the mask.</p>

    <p>He had never panicked when facing such a fierce map boss. Instead, he had this kind of emotion when facing Sun Rong... Wang Ling wasn't sure if it was panic or nervousness. Or other emotions.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because he is worried that Sun Rong will be angry with him for concealing his behavior after being exposed by Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>But why should he care about what girls think of him...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like he wasn't like this before.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because he's gotten too close to Sun Rong these days?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>What to do?</p>

    <p>Should he open the door first?</p>

    <p>At this moment, there is only a door in the main hall between him and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The two people's thoughts were surprisingly in sync with each other.</p>
