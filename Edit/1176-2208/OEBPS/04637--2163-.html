  <h1>Chapter 2163 Bravely Play Strategy Stream</h1>

  <div>

    <p>See Sun Rong to make up your mind. Only then did Lao Huang smile.</p>

    <p>Yes. His plan succeeded.</p>

    <p>Although Lao Huang is not very old, as an adult who has had several emotional experiences, how can he not see the little Jiujiu in Sun Rong's heart?</p>

    <p>And Lao Huang actually knew it well. He felt that this Fuyun Town general... was probably Zhenren, not an NPC.</p>

    <p>But Lao Huang suffered from the lack of any evidence.</p>

    <p>Just because the player who played the NPC general was so dedicated, Lao Huang once suspected that this person either graduated from the acting department or the directing department.</p>

    <p>This is so life-changing!</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's such a pity. Since Miss Sun has decided to marry me, I won't win anyone's love." Old Huang shrugged and sighed.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong has made up its mind, it still feels a little uneasy inside.</p>

    <p>Not all players can master the strategy flow. Those who can use the method of strategy strategy to break out in the game world of Itinerant Immortal are very mature galgame players.</p>

    <p>They are often well versed in strategies. They will understand how to operate the behavioral logic of game NPCs and deduce how to use game mechanisms to gain as much favor as possible from a certain NPC.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has also played similar games. She has also played the popular mobile game {Love and Paper Man} a while ago. But compared to the same type of galgame games. This kind of mobile games can usually be purchased through krypton gold. The way to use money ability to achieve the purpose of increasing favorability...</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal is in the game world of the Magic Circle. Now that Sun Rong has no weapons, how can I gain the favor of this general?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels a little troubled by this.</p>

    <p>"Those who are barefoot are not afraid of those who wear shoes. Sometimes if you think too much, it may not be a good thing."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Huang comforted Sun Rong and said: "Our logical thinking cannot be compared with professional strategy players. So it is completely meaningless to think about what strategy techniques they use."</p>

    <p>"So Lao Huang, what you mean is..."</p>

    <p>"Be spontaneous, follow your heart."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said: "Our current position is Wolong Recruitment Officer. The general of Fuyun Town also gave you the authority to manage Fuyun Town on his behalf. So I have a hunch that the basic value of his favorability towards you should be not low. Maybe you can A little more reckless."</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, has anything happened between you and him before? He would directly delegate the power of the town to a novice player. This is also a bit outrageous."</p>

    <p>I have to say. Lao Huang's words suddenly awakened Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"By the way... I helped him take care of the children in the house and teach them lessons..."</p>

    <p>"No wonder."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang clapped his hands: "If that's the case, it makes sense. As a father, the most troublesome thing is definitely not making money to support the family. It is taking care of the children and teaching them to complete their homework! I have many friends who are tutoring me. The Golden Core broke when the child was doing homework."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that Lao Huang would have such an experience like speaking out from his own experience.</p>

    <p>And with the in-depth communication with Lao Huang, although Lao Huang did not directly tell what kind of work he was engaged in in the real world, Sun Rong could more or less feel a bit of Lao Huang's maturity. The image of young social animals.</p>

    <p>He should be in his early thirties. He is more than ten years older than her and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The occupation I am engaged in does not conflict with staying at home. Therefore, it may be an Internet-related occupation such as a programmer.</p>

    <p>After getting in touch with Lao Huang, she found that Lao Huang was a very cheerful and open-minded person, just like a little sun.</p>

    <p>Such a personality is very infectious to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>If you can. Sun Rong I really want to meet Lao Huang in the real world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has a social fear.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang is another social cow.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that if in the real world, Lao Huang's existence might also affect Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. After returning to the game world, Wang Ling checked his data panel immediately.</p>

    <p>Character attribute values. Wang Ling no longer cares about it at all. Because there is a god-level skill that can change destiny. Wang Ling can easily achieve attribute reversal through level deficit.</p>

    <p>At this moment, what he really cares about is his health bar.</p>

    <p>During the time he was away, the intelligent AI arranged by Wang Ming repeated his pattern of chanting mantras and helped him increase his health bar from the previous 100 million to 200 million.</p>

    <p>How long had he been gone? He actually gained 100 million more blood by relying on AI to hang up...</p>

    <p>How does this intelligent AI do it?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling imagined the scene of the AI silently reading the formula. I feel that there must be quite a lot of ghostly elements in it. Otherwise, it would never be possible to achieve such an effect.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, Wang Ling is quite satisfied with the current situation. Because of the existence of intelligent AI, Wang Ling has not been interrupted much.</p>

    <p>I just don't know if Sun Rong and European Airlines had any suspicions about me while I was away.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the General's Mansion, Wang Ling woke up from a state of sitting cross-legged and dozing.</p>

    <p>He was still working hard to play the role of the general of Fuyun Town. He was about to get up and go to the Wolong Recruitment Office to see the situation on the spot.</p>

    <p>A familiar figure suddenly appeared in front of him outside the main hall.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>This time is not the time to report on work.</p>

    <p>So I came here. Do you have other matters?</p>

    <p>Or... Sun Rong has already noticed the truth?</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Wang Ling's expression no longer looked so calm. Although it was only a subtle change, it was undeniable that there were some micro-expressions on this paralyzed face.</p>

    <p>The emotional constraints in the real world make Wang Ling's emotional response less sensitive. But this is a game. The virtual game world will give the most realistic response through the player's nervous system.</p>

    <p>In other words, even though Wang Ling does not have any emotional reactions in the real world, the game system can directly present emotions into the game world by capturing nerves.</p>

    <p>In other words. Various emotional reactions in the game world. Some of them are neural capture assistance on the system side.</p>

    <p>So the moment I saw Wang Ling, I didn't know what Sun Rong was here for. Wang Ling suddenly felt a little panicked.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a drop of sweat slid down the cheek under the mask.</p>

    <p>He had never panicked when facing such a fierce map boss. Instead, he had this kind of emotion when facing Sun Rong... Wang Ling wasn't sure if it was panic or nervousness. Or other emotions.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because he is worried that Sun Rong will be angry with him for concealing his behavior after being exposed by Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>But why should you care about what girls think of you...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like I wasn't like this before.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because you've gotten too close to Sun Rong these days?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>What to do?</p>

    <p>Do you want to open the door first?</p>

    <p>At this moment, there is only a door in the main hall between him and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The two people's thoughts were surprisingly in sync with each other.</p>
