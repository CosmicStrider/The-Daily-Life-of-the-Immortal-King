  <h1>Chapter 2124 Working Soldier</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If you want to get rich, you must first plant trees. Everyone knows this truth. Mr. Canghu is no exception. But what he wants to plant is not just trees, but spiritual plants that can be used in the feature resource area. The principle is similar.</p>

    <p>The resource area is very large. Some rare spiritual plants grow on cliffs. It is very difficult to pick them. If you are not careful, you may be in danger of returning to Novice Village and starting all over again.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Mr. Canghu's goal is very clear. He will not consider rare spiritual plants from the beginning. Picking them is difficult and time-consuming. The convoy responsible for escorting him will only stay in the camp where they are stationed for a maximum of three days. Therefore, all actions must be done with a stopwatch in mind. to estimate.</p>

    <p>In addition, in terms of security issues, it is safest to move within five kilometers of the camp area.</p>

    <p>As for the location of the camp, it was decided by Mr. Canghu. This is equivalent to giving Mr. Canghu a ready opportunity.</p>

    <p>After entering the jungle landscape, he immediately analyzed the entire map based on the existing cultivation knowledge he had. Even though the spiritual plants he wanted to collect were not as rare as those on the cliffs, based on the growth habits of the spiritual plants, he analyzed where they might be able to dig. It is still very helpful to get spiritual plants with relatively high levels.</p>

    <p>"Right here." Soon, Mr. Canghu determined his target. He stared at a triangular area on the map and said to the captain of the convoy in front of him.</p>

    <p>The rainfall here is very high. Because of the mountain fog, the entire environment is extremely humid. As a result, many fungi grow.</p>

    <p>"Okay, boss." The team captain nodded. He is a strong bald man, but his voice is not as rough as his body. There is a kind of cuteness in contrast. He looks like he can talk easily.</p>

    <p>The bald captain was also a little surprised by Mr. Canghu's choice: "But boss, are you sure you choose this place? There are many mushrooms growing in this place. There are many kinds. It is difficult for a normal monk to distinguish them."</p>

    <p>This unexpected additional dialogue is a kind reminder deliberately arranged by Bai Qiao for players. This prompt was not available during the previous closed beta.</p>

    <p>The player directly selected this area and ate poisonous mushrooms just after entering. The Lilliputian country lingered in front of his eyes and he died suddenly...</p>

    <p>Fungi and plants in the world of cultivation are the most difficult to distinguish clearly, because some fungi are very similar in appearance. However, it is also easy for people to misjudge them. Only by mastering all the details can you ensure that you will not eat them by mistake.</p>

    <p>The most common way to distinguish them is that the brighter the colors, the more toxic the fungi are. But in fact, there are also brightly colored fungi that are completely non-toxic.</p>

    <p>As a walking encyclopedia, Mr. Canghu is very confident in his knowledge reserve... and in the real world, he himself is not afraid of mushroom toxins. This is closely related to the skills he practices.</p>

    <p>But it was precisely because of his skills that he turned into the appearance of this Canghu... I can only say that he understood the principle that good and bad fortunes depend on each other earlier than most people.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Canghu also knows very well. This is a game...</p>

    <p>When his abilities in the real world are transferred to the game world, he has no special advantages.</p>

    <p>This was forcibly cut and belongs to...</p>

    <p>After sighing in his heart, Mr. Canghu officially set off with the convoy he hired. He began his journey as a working warrior in the game world...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Line of sight returns Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu is working part-time. Although Wang Ling and Sun Rong seem to have a more comfortable life here than Mr. Canghu. But training with children is not a part-time job?</p>

    <p>I have to say that Sun Rong's educational and entertaining approach is very successful. This approach may not necessarily be useful for all children. In the final analysis, it is still about taking the right medicine and controlling the method.</p>

    <p>It started with sandbag throwing. Out of dissatisfaction with the number of sandbags, these children in the General Mansion began to spontaneously learn to throw psychic balls. This was used to solve the problem of insufficient ammunition when throwing each other.</p>

    <p>This is a basic spell in which spiritual power is gathered into the palms of the hands and rolled into balls. The principle is similar to the Sword Master's unique skill {Palm Sword}.</p>

    <p>This group of children learn very quickly once they are interested. And as long as one person learns it, he will definitely share it with his teammates.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Now I understand the purpose of Sun Rong in letting the older child take care of the younger child in the first place.</p>

    <p>One big and one small. Divided into nine groups. One group of two people. It seems like the big one leads the small ones. In fact, it is a precise distribution of talents. She deliberately let those children with high understanding to lead those with low understanding. Then one group As long as one person knows how to do it, he will definitely help his teammates in order to win.</p>

    <p>It is unimaginable. In less than two hours, these children have grown extremely rapidly. This basic parabolic art has grown to the third level at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Soon. Wang Ling completed the third hidden task.</p>

    <p>[System: You have completed the time-limited task]</p>

    <p>[Within 3 days of game time, 18 children successfully learned spells of level 3 or above. And received a hidden reward: General's Order]</p>

    <p>General's order?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opens the detailed introduction of the inventory.</p>

    <p>[General's Order: You will receive the following rights after receiving this order]</p>

    <p>[①: Has the ability to inspect troop strength. A box for the number of soldiers has been added to your system map. You can check the troop strength on the map where the general's mansion is located.]</p>

    <p>[②: Has the right to launch expeditions. Can launch attacks against cultivation countries of different camps that are hostile.]</p>

    <p>Note 1: Each time an expedition is launched, the cooling time is 7 days.</p>

    <p>Note 2: After winning remotely, you can only choose one of the following options to obtain rewards.</p>

    <p>1: Build the general's palace here. Get the remaining troops here. At the same time, you will face the pressure of the enemy camp launching a counterattack.</p>

    <p>Two: Disarm this place. And obtain all the resources of this map. At the same time, you will face the pressure of completely enmity with the local camp. And your reputation in the outside world will also become lower.</p>

    <p>[③: Have the right to recruit. You can already initiate Wolong recruitment orders to surrounding areas through Fuyun Town General Mansion. The recruited Wolongs will send you self-recommendation letters through the system mailbox. The higher the regional economic level, the more stable the life of regional monks. The higher the happiness index, the higher the comprehensive quality of Wolong that can be recruited]</p>

    <p>[④: I would rather force the children in the general's mansion to get married. And let them marry other generals' mansions and retrograde marriages to expand their sphere of influence]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. When I saw the introduction of this item, Wang Ling suddenly felt like I was doing this task in vain.</p>

    <p>Starting a war or something like that is not something his character can do in the first place...</p>

    <p>Of course, the weirdest thing is Article 4. Children in the family can actually be used as a condition for marriage...</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling feel a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>The eighteen children in the General's Mansion are quite a lot of strange species! Can they be married into each other?</p>

    <p>Looking at the introduction in front of me, Wang Ling felt a little confused...</p>
