  <h1>Chapter 1425 Unknown opponent</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time that the Sword Conference was being held in the Sword King Realm, the core members of the Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal Hall were also visiting remotely to watch this unprecedented grand competition.</p>

    <p>The monk meditates at the front.</p>

    <p>He used the swastika sword to penetrate his eye power into the sword storm of the Sword King Realm and saw the battle taking place inside.</p>

    <p>Then. The picture is fed back through pupil force.</p>

    <p>It is then projected from the ring scar on the monk's head, forming a projection in the void.</p>

    <p>This scene made Lord Diulei marvel in his heart: "As expected of Senior Jin Deng. In addition to making smoke and cooking hot pot, this scar actually has such a function..."</p>

    <p>"They are just trivial tricks." The monk smiled, as modest as ever.</p>

    <p>He also paid special attention to this Sword conference. But the focus was not on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sword conference.</p>

    <p>It was a foregone conclusion in the monk's mind that the girl would win the championship.</p>

    <p>The key point lies in the unknown enemy from the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>This matter was already known to the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception when Wang Ling was deduced last night.</p>

    <p>Of course. Sun Rong doesn't know.</p>

    <p>This is the monk's suggestion. In order to let her relax and concentrate on the game in front of her.</p>

    <p>As for protecting the earth, just leave it to these gentlemen.</p>

    <p>Now. When Wang Ling is in the Sword King Realm, the monk is the last line of defense on earth...</p>

    <p>Although the unknown opponent from the Infinite Galaxy is heading towards the Sword King Realm, its ultimate goal is to be on guard.</p>

    <p>"What is the opponent of Infinite Galaxy like?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>After meeting Wang Ling, he found that all the knowledge he had accumulated on cultivation was of no use at all.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling. He got to know more powerful seniors hidden among cultivators.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling. His "view of maps" has also been completely expanded...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei suddenly discovered that he had many blind spots in knowledge.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling plays the role of constantly breaking through his blind spots...</p>

    <p>Not only did it bring him into contact with higher-level knowledge, it also allowed him to rub the knowledge he now knew about cultivation on the ground.</p>

    <p>"The Infinite Galaxy. Because it's too far away, I don't go there that often. Before every time I go, I have to collect a lot of supplies in advance to prepare for emergencies on the road." The monk said.</p>

    <p>He calculated with his fingers. If he traveled from the extraterrestrial galaxy to the infinite galaxy, it might take about half a year.</p>

    <p>Not counting Wang Ling. Even at his level, it would take half a year. Others want to get there. It is simply impossible without external help.</p>

    <p>"There are rumors that the celestial tomb built by Dao Ancestor Wang is in this infinite galaxy. The poor monk has visited it more than 76,000 times."</p>

    <p>"..." When everyone heard this, the corners of their mouths twitched.</p>

    <p>I have been there more than 76,000 times... the monk actually calls this. Not many?</p>

    <p>But based on the monk's experience of nearly 4,000 reincarnations.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the number of trips to the Infinite Galaxy may not be so unusual after all.</p>

    <p>"The Infinite Galaxy is too vast. The small space there is larger than the outer galaxy."</p>

    <p>The monk lamented: "Although this poor monk has suffered a lot, his exploration rate of the infinite galaxy is less than 0.1%."</p>

    <p>"Senior didn't notice any signs of living things?"</p>

    <p>"At least not in all the times I've explored."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "It is precisely because of this. This time Ling Zhenren suddenly said that there is an unknown opponent from the infinite galaxy. This even surprised the poor monk."</p>

    <p>"So now we can only wait."</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren and I originally deduced that their target was Leng Ming. But Leng Ming's battle has ended. The other party has not yet taken action."</p>

    <p>"Are you here for the Sun Rong girl?"</p>

    <p>"In other words, Leng Ming and Miss Sun are both targets."</p>

    <p>The monk lowered his eyes and said thoughtfully: "Let's see what they do. After the fight, you will know their true combat power."</p>

    <p>As he said this, everyone turned their attention back to the Sword Conference.</p>

    <p>The competition for the champion group is about to begin.</p>

    <p>The first person in the Foundation Building on Earth: Sun Rong. Coming soon.</p>

    <p>When she walked into the outskirts of the sword fighting arena, the roaring noise in the arena was already lingering in the girl's ears.</p>

    <p>The girl's expression was much calmer than expected.</p>

    <p>The sword energy flowing out in all directions in the field were all testing her cultivation.</p>

    <p>Many sword spirits had question marks on their faces.</p>

    <p>"Human?"</p>

    <p>"Why can a human from the Foundation Building stage participate in the Sword Conference?"</p>

    <p>"Haven't you noticed yet? This human being has become one with his own sword. The human sword."</p>

    <p>The sword spirit with excellent eyesight explained.</p>

    <p>The passive version of Sun Rong merges the human sword into one. It makes itself and the spiritual sword indistinguishable from each other.</p>

    <p>Although the realm is still Foundation Building, the increase in overall combat power is very considerable.</p>

    <p>"Fifty people from the east entrance. Please line up in an orderly manner. We are ready to enter!" said a royal sword guard at the front of the queue.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong. At the end of the line at the east entrance.</p>

    <p>There has been such a limelight thing in the past. Sun Rong was definitely the first one to get ahead.</p>

    <p>Now. A lot has indeed changed.</p>

    <p>On the other hand. This is also Sun Rong's own idea.</p>

    <p>This Sword King Realm is the world of Sword Spirits after all. It seems unreasonable for her to come here as a human and participate in the Sword Conference.</p>

    <p>Even before the competition started, everyone had criticized humans for participating in the Sword Conference.</p>

    <p>Although Aohai ranks high on the sword list, due to its hybrid quality, many sword spirits dislike it despite its counterattack.</p>

    <p>This time. Sun Rong chose to participate in the Sword Conference. On the one hand, it was to win the Jian Shen alloy. To choose a suitable sword spirit for Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is actually for Aohai's sake.</p>

    <p>Sword King Realm is the hometown of Aohai.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong doesn't want to. After Aohai returned to his hometown, he still suffered cold looks and discrimination.</p>

    <p>She wants to take Aohai with her to tell all the sword spirits in the Sword King Realm that Aohai is not a useless no-name spirit sword! Even if she has a bad background, she can still successfully counterattack the king group!</p>

    <p>Even if it's luck. So what?</p>

    <p>Luck itself is also part of strength.</p>

    <p>When the floodgates of the East District slowly opened.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is wearing a blue French skirt. Holding an Aohai in his hand, he holds his head high.</p>

    <p>This magic skirt is the +0 opponent-level magic skirt that Miss Ajuan gave last time. Now it has become the girl's battle uniform.</p>

    <p>She followed the end of the team and walked out facing the light.</p>

    <p>With the appearance of the only human girl, the sword fighting arena was once again filled with excitement. Although the crowd of sword spirits onlookers was densely packed, not many people had actually seen Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In full view of the crowd, the girl received all kinds of scorching gazes from the crowd. She began to feel the pressure that Leng Ming was carrying before the start of the game.</p>

    <p>"Interesting. A human girl actually brought her own brand-name sword to participate in the competition. She really dared to come."</p>

    <p>"She looks pretty cute. She's my type."</p>

    <p>"But someone knows. Why is the off-brand sword in her hand ranked seventh on the sword list?"</p>

    <p>"Who knows. Maybe it's just because the skin looks better?"</p>

    <p>Regarding Sun Rong's participation in the competition, the rhythm in the Sword King Realm has not stopped until now.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Jiu You didn't expect that the sword spirits in the Sword King Realm would be so exclusive.</p>

    <p>"Girl, don't you release your sword energy? Let us see how powerful this off-brand sword, which is ranked seventh on the sword list, is!" The sword spirit who had something to do was shouted loudly in the spectator seats. Immediately It caused another storm.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Close your eyes slightly. Take a deep breath. Try to calm down.</p>

    <p>Then, he used his slender white fingers to touch the scabbard of the sword. Facing the shouts around him, he pulled out the sword body inch by inch.</p>

    <p>"As you wish."</p>

    <p>The next moment, the girl opened her beautiful eyes.</p>

    <p>However, he only pulled out less than three centimeters of the sword body. Aohai's sword energy like an angry sea surged out from the gap, sweeping over the place like a tsunami!</p>

    <p>In the field, all the sword spirits looked horrified!</p>

    <p>This powerful sword energy overflowed and rolled in the field. It actually caused illusions in their eyes!</p>

    <p>The sword fighting arena in front of them suddenly turned into a sea!</p>

    <p>And in the sea.</p>

    <p>It's all water...</p>
