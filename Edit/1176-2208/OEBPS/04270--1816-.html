  <h1>Chapter 1816 The Skeleton Prince's Little Thoughts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the cosmic space inside King's Eyes, he watched the Skeleton Prince working hard to break through the shield. For a moment, Wang Ling couldn't bear to do anything to this idiot prince...</p>

    <p>Although his face was fleshless and there was no expression on his face, his posture could really be said to be one of concentration. He was as serious as Wang Ling himself when he was reviewing his homework on weekdays.</p>

    <p>This kind of seriousness is not fake. Wang Ling can see it. This Skeleton Prince really intends to break through his 100 million layers of shields...</p>

    <p>It's just that it's not easy to break through the shield.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has always been prudent in his approach. He also cast a refreshing spell when deploying the first layer of shields.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if the Skeleton Prince finally breaks through to the last level, if there is no way to unlock his refreshing spell first and choose to break through directly.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>Those shields that he had broken before.</p>

    <p>It will be refreshed again.</p>

    <p>He couldn't bear to disturb this idiot prince who was concentrating on breaking the shield. Instead, he withdrew from King's Eyes and allowed the Skeleton Prince to continue to complete his "grand ambition."</p>

    <p>On the other side, the Skeleton Prince in the broken shield also breathed a sigh of relief after seeing Wang Ling leave.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment Wang Ling took away his rosary, he had actually clearly sensed the gap in combat power with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, a head-on confrontation with Wang Ling is a dead end.</p>

    <p>He is the last remnant of the undead. He must first ensure that he is alive.</p>

    <p>And as the last legacy, he is still a member of the royal family.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is impossible to surrender. Today's Internet hot words of "Rufa<sup>1</sup>" cannot appear on him. Therefore, as the royal descendant of the undead, the Skeleton Prince's final stubbornness is to divert attention by breaking the shield.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("乳法" Breast Milk.)</dfn>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling is gone, the pressure has dropped significantly. But he also knows very clearly that his work of breaking the shield must not stop. If he can drill for a moment longer, he can keep his life.</p>

    <p>After returning to the cramped, dark, and damp chamber, Wang Ling discovered that the finger bone that the Skeleton Prince used to drill Sun Rong was indeed invisible. But in fact, through his pupil power, he could still see that the finger bone was still there. Working very hard.</p>

    <p>After curling up his body back into the corner, Wang Ling buried his head in his knees again. Then with a "pop" sound, he secretly snapped his fingers and resumed the flow of time.</p>

    <p>He and the Skeleton Prince had a "battle" in the King's Eyes space.</p>

    <p>In fact, it doesn't waste much time in reality at all.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen looked at the secret room Number 1 of Number 60 High School where there was still no progress. She was dumbfounded as she sat in front of the monitor.</p>

    <p>She must have just pressed the button...</p>

    <p>Why is there no movement at all?</p>

    <p>Is this button fake?</p>

    <p>At this time, Mrs. Lawen secretly gritted her teeth. When the senior handed the button to her, she clearly said that there were only three chances to test the button.</p>

    <p>And every time it is pressed, a powerful Eternal will be summoned to help.</p>

    <p>But she had clearly pressed it just now. Why was there no response at all?</p>

    <p>With a doubtful attitude, Lawen continued to press the button for the second time on the secret rooms of Sun Rong and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After sensing that the second Eternal One was coming, Wang Ling's familiar finger snapping sound came again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The second Eternal One is a lion-headed half-orc. He is also one of the declining races in the Eternal Period. After seeing Wang Ling, this lion-headed half-orc obviously had a bit of surprise in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling. He had a scornful attitude: "Although our lineage has declined, I can still recreate the glory of the eternal Lion King in front of you."</p>

    <p>The Eternal Lion Clan values the power of blood. Therefore, the moment this lion-headed man appeared, he sensed the blood aura of Wang Ling as a human on earth.</p>

    <p>Ordinary, mediocre, bland, vulgar...</p>

    <p>These words flashed through the lion-headed man's mind instantly.</p>

    <p>However, he also couldn't figure it out at the same time. How could a young boy from Earth be able to stand firm and compete with him head-on despite his spiritual pressure?</p>

    <p>And before him...</p>

    <p>There should be other Eternal coming, right?</p>

    <p>He remembered that the undead skeleton prince had obviously been summoned away.</p>

    <p>But at the scene, why wasn't there any breath left?</p>

    <p>Looking at the lion-headed man in front of him, Wang Ling sighed silently. Without saying anything, he directly activated the King's Eyes space and "invited" the lion-headed man in.</p>

    <p>"Damn... how could this earthling have such a method?"</p>

    <p>When the lion-headed man realized that he had been sucked into the King's Eyes space, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>There was an expression of disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>Because in the universe of King's Eyes, he saw the undead skeleton prince who came in before him.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing..." At this point, the lion-headed man was shocked.</p>

    <p>Because this Skeleton Prince seems to be working very hard to dig into something in the King's Eyes space...</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Here you are... Brother Lion! I am breaking the shield! You don't understand! This shield is difficult to break! I must break it today!" The Skeleton Prince laughed.</p>

    <p>"I think you are cowarded! You are the royal descendant of the undead! This is just an earthling. Are you afraid of this?" The lion-headed man snorted, his tone indifferent.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the golden mane surrounding his neck suddenly released dazzling light like the sun. The hardness of each golden mane was strengthened, and it became a peerless sword. It flew out in all directions. !</p>

    <p>This is the most powerful power derived from his golden mane. In a short period of time, the sword energy in the void of the universe was crisscrossed and unstoppable. Countless stars were divided into powder by the sword energy. At the same time, there was an endless breath of chaos coming from that root. The roots turned into sword rays and were released from the mane.</p>

    <p>In the end, these flying manes gathered in the sky. They condensed into a golden nine-headed lion and rushed towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This scene is very scary. The nine golden lions show their kingly posture in the sky.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can be seen that this is the ability of "Dharma Arms." Only the extremely powerful Eternal One can display it.</p>

    <p>Armed with law.</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, this is after summoning one's own dharma image. The dharma image is strengthened again through powerful means, such as putting on a layer of armor. At this time, the nine-headed lion's dharma image is sacrificed from the lion-headed man. His golden mane is spread all over his body. He is armed to the teeth.</p>

    <p>The golden manes turned into extremely tough and peerless swords. They were stuck upside down on the nine lions, completely covering their bodies, like hedgehogs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw this scene and suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>Since it's a sword...</p>

    <p>Then it will be easier to handle.</p>

    <p>"Sword comes--"</p>

    <p>At this moment, he had a thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>Jingke was summoned directly.</p>

    <p>Slash forward!</p>

    <p>In the first encounter, the sword fell and the golden nine-headed lion collapsed on the spot...</p>
