  <h1>Chapter 1710 Great Mercy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Eighty-eight vajra pestles. They are as powerful as missiles with explosive destructive power. They fly all over the sky and turn into golden streamers, dragging long qi.</p>

    <p>Jingze knows. This is the purifying Buddha light that comes with the vajra. As long as ordinary people touch a little of it, they will immediately have the idea of immediately becoming a Buddha and abandoning all distracting thoughts. There is only peace in the heart, no war.</p>

    <p>If there were only one or a few Vajra, he and Yan might be able to deal with it. But the eighty-eight Vajra greatly superimposes the power of purifying the Buddha's light. If it is hit, the result is really hard to say.</p>

    <p>These vajra pestles are refined from the most holy relics in the most holy body of Buddhism in the past dynasties. The blessings on them are filled with extraordinary magic power. The effect is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>And "purifying Buddha's light" is also the basis of every Buddhist magic. After all, what Buddhists emphasize is "compassion." The existence of purifying Buddha's light is to kill the will to fight. Let you be enveloped by Buddha's light and have no temper at all.</p>

    <p>Of course Jingze couldn't let Jin Deng get what he wanted.</p>

    <p>He carefully guarded the vajra behind him. At the same time, he quickly locked his breath on the vajra flying in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Exploding Star" Jingze shouted. There was a snap. The familiar sound of snapping fingers came from the diamond glove on Jingze's hand. He locked his breath on multiple flying vajra pestles at the same time and clicked his fingers to detonate them.</p>

    <p>Stars suddenly appeared in the void. Then there was a huge explosion sound. A chaotic atmosphere was generated from inside the vajra and then exploded directly. More than a dozen vajra were blown up on the spot.</p>

    <p>However, there were too many vajra pestles. With each other alternating to cover their advance, Jingze was unable to clear all the vajra pestles at once.</p>

    <p>The monk's face remained calm. His gaze fell lightly on the diamond glove on Jingze's hand.</p>

    <p>The exclusive Dragonborn Chaos Weapon is indeed extraordinary. If it weren't for his numerical advantage, I'm afraid his vajra would have been neutralized by just a few snaps of his fingers.</p>

    <p>This is the power of the third-level sequence: annihilation level chaos device.</p>

    <p>However, it is not completely without shortcomings.</p>

    <p>The power of the Diamond Glove is unparalleled, but it cannot attack on a large scale. It is a type of magic weapon for precision strikes.</p>

    <p>The monk had been on guard when Jingze took out the diamond gloves.</p>

    <p>This was the glove that sent Li Xian into the intensive care unit with just two snaps of his fingers. There was no way he wouldn't be on guard.</p>

    <p>And when he was prepared, the impact of the diamond gloves on Jin Deng was actually not that big.</p>

    <p>Because he has already become one with this boundless Buddhist court.</p>

    <p>If you want to destroy him, you must destroy this supreme world together.</p>

    <p>And this supreme world called the Infinite Buddha Courtyard is a pure land of bliss that has been condensed and inherited by the sages of Buddhism throughout the ages through their own cultivation. How can it be destroyed so easily?</p>

    <p>Jingze felt that his diamond gloves were about to burst into flames. But when faced with the eighty-eight vajra pestles that were about to attack him, although some of them had already been dealt with, the efficiency of using only diamond gloves to deal with them was really too low.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he felt the ground shaking behind him. The depths of this golden pure land of bliss began to riot. There was the sound of huge floods. Endless hot magma overflowed and poured out from the surface.</p>

    <p>"Monk, don't bully him!" Yan? shouted.</p>

    <p>The monk was a little stunned by this scene. The Dragonborn's power was greater than he imagined. He could actually change the environmental structure in other people's supreme world and create a terrain that was beneficial to him.</p>

    <p>This is difficult for ordinary cultivators to do.</p>

    <p>And because the monk has turned on the "Swastika", I can be sure that this is not an illusion. It is a real red tide!</p>

    <p>The monstrous red magma erupted from the ground, carrying an astonishing power and murderous aura. It was like the endless blood pouring out of the crack in the door in the movie The Shining.</p>

    <p>And in this monstrous magma, the monk heard the sound of iron chains clanking!</p>

    <p>Monstrous red magma erupted from the ground, bringing with it an astonishing power and murderous aura, just like the scene in the movie "The Shining" where endless blood and water came pouring out of a doorway.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine that such a huge thing could be the Dragonborn Chaos Device of such a little girl.</p>

    <p>Burning Sky Chain Hammer!</p>

    <p>The most powerful magical weapon that reaches the fourth level of light in the Chaos Sequence!</p>

    <p>Wu Xin had mentioned it to Jingze before. But when he actually saw such a light weapon being sacrificed by Yan?, he still had an unreal feeling.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>A large area of fire pillars erupted, rising from the ground of the Infinite Buddhist Courtyard. Behind the eyes appeared countless virtual images of flaming creatures. Firebirds, fire horses, fire leopards...Densely packed flaming creatures filled the horizon. Running toward Charge forward and kill.</p>

    <p>They were completely unafraid of life and death and rushed towards the remaining Vajra.</p>

    <p>The number of these thousands of troops far exceeded the monk's Vajra. In an instant, a certain area of the infinite Buddhist court was turned into a sea of fire.</p>

    <p>The purifying Buddha light of the vajra had limited power to compete with these flaming creatures before it was close to its destination. The power of purification turned these magma creatures summoned by the Sky-Burning Chain Hammer into bubbles and steam.</p>

    <p>However, the number of these creatures was too great. They came like a flood. While the monk's vajra was delayed, Jingze's snapping of his fingers did not stop.</p>

    <p>Not long after, all eighty-eight vajra pestles were destroyed.</p>

    <p>"It's actually a Chaos Artifact of the Light Sequence..." This Chain Hammer of Burning Heaven was more than the monk had expected, and he hadn't even realized that this relatively weak-looking little girl had such a Chaos Artifact of Sequence Level 4 in her hands.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Several gorillas with their bodies burning in flames rushed towards him. They could be as tall as ten feet. They were flexible and attacked from behind, trying to sneak attack on the monk.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng didn't look at it. He just folded his hands and recited Buddhist scriptures silently. A golden light spread from the lotus sitting under him in all directions.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, these flame orangutans were shaken into flying ashes!</p>

    <p>At the same time, the monks are clearing the place, trying to restore order to the supreme world.</p>

    <p>The large area of the sea of fire was subsided. However, there was always a small area burning with flames. This surprised the monk. He had never encountered a chaos device of the light sequence. Now he witnessed it with his own eyes in the hands of a Dragonborn. I also feel a bit overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the Chaos Device of the Light Sequence is too overbearing. It is like a ray of light that cannot be dispelled. As long as it shines on a world, it will never dissipate.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jin Deng closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Things have reached this point. In addition to using 100% of his strength, it doesn't look good enough. He also has to come up with something bottom-line to respond.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>Three groups of Buddha fire appear in the past, present and future.</p>

    <p>Lingering around Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>This is what he gained through enlightenment after going through reincarnations.</p>

    <p>It is also one of the strongest trump cards in his hand!</p>

    <p>I just don't know which one is stronger or weaker compared to this light weapon.</p>

    <p>"There is no end to the sea of suffering. Turning back is the end." Before activating the Buddha's fire, he sent a voice in the supreme world. He gave the final warning to the two dragon descendants, Yan? and Jingze.</p>
