  <h1>Chapter 1884 Sun Ying'er is heartbroken!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying also knew that Sun Ying'er was missing. Although on the surface he remained calm, secretly he had activated Shadow's sensing ability many times.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't know why. After arriving in this eternal world, the connection between Sun Ying'er and him was completely cut off. There was no sign of any linkage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying is sure. This is definitely not a problem with Shadow. After all, the connection between him and Wang Ling is still there. And this also happens to show that Shadow is operating normally.</p>

    <p>But why can't he sense Sun Ying'er?</p>

    <p>Wang Ying thinks there may be other reasons for this.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the good news now is that the four emperors who currently control the overall situation of the eternal world. Emperor Dongda is jointly controlled by Wang Ling and him. The other three emperors are their own.</p>

    <p>In addition, Zhuo Yi also plays the role of Liu Muchen, who controls the strongest intelligence network in the world. As long as a few people join forces, even if it is to find a needle in a haystack, it is not that difficult to find a targeted person.</p>

    <p>As long as they each use their own power to send out appropriate signals throughout the universe, it will be fine.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important premise here is that Sun Ying'er must respond.</p>

    <p>For example, in the auction house before, Wang Ling used hints to contact Qin Zhong, Liu Qingyi and You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>While waiting for the rest of his friends to arrive at Chunlan Building, Wang Ying clearly felt uneasy.</p>

    <p>"Master of Shadows. But you're worried about Ying'er?" Sun Rong was pleased to hear this.</p>

    <p>She thinks this is a good demonstration. It has very important reference value especially for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, although demonstration is classic, tsundere is also classic.</p>

    <p>She saw Wang Ying snort. He held his arms with Emperor Dongda's body and said coldly: "Ah. Who will worry about her? She finally hid in this eternal world. She doesn't need to be controlled by me. I'm afraid she is happy."</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ying's arrogance is not as exaggerated as Jiugong Liangzi's, he still has his own unique side. Sun Rong thinks this may be the contrast between the legendary cuteness.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ying really has nothing to do with the word cute.</p>

    <p>"Master of Shadows. It seems not good to lie. Don't you hope to find Ying'er?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. It's the best to find her. It saves me taking time to look for her every night. It causes her back pain. I also have back pain."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>When everyone heard this, they couldn't help but gasp. Those who didn't know the truth felt that the amount of information in this sentence seemed a bit large.</p>

    <p>This master hasn't even started yet. The shadows are making rapid progress... and they are already so bored!</p>

    <p>This, this, this... what a shame!</p>

    <p>"Perhaps the Master of Shadows is right. Ying'er is not here. You are indeed relieved. But except for Ying'er, I am afraid no one can stand your Planet thumping technique." Sun Rong spoke again. She chose to retreat instead of advance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying is as stubborn as ever. He refuses to admit that he wants to find Sun Ying'er: "Even if I, Wang Ying, am scolded to death, I will never think about this girl. She is the Lord of the Void.  Are you worried about me? You're kidding!"</p>

    <p>The brief conversation between the two echoed in this space. No one could get a word in.</p>

    <p>The rest of the people just watched silently.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's gaze never stopped falling on Emperor Dongda. This sight made Emperor Dongda stand on end.</p>

    <p>But the person she really cares about is not Emperor Dongda. It's Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She really wanted to know how much Wang Ling had learned from it...</p>

    <p>"There's always a way."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Zhen spoke weakly and comforted everyone: "And I think it doesn't matter if we don't find anyone. As long as we complete this plot, it means that our mission is over. And once the mission is over, everyone who traveled from modern times to eternity can go back together, right?"</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, that's true. But I'm always worried about what might happen."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "In short, it would be best to find everyone. Brother Wang Zhen, don't worry too much. Don't worry. Your child will definitely not be born before the script ends. After all, you've only been pregnant for a short time, and you haven't taken any magic pills that can quickly induce pregnancy. It should be fine."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's words touched Wang Zhen's heart. He immediately blushed and said, "Let me explain first. I am not doing it for myself..."</p>

    <p>"I know. We all understand." Zhuo Yi reached out and patted his shoulder: "If it were me, I would be panicked. So when it comes to this, we all have to learn from Senior Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Do you think that Jin Deng-senpai never experienced childbirth when he chose to be a woman in his countless reincarnations..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Just when the scene fell into a dead silence following Zhuo Yi's remarks.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Ying'er is also desperate.</p>

    <p>Why didn't she want to get in touch with the army as soon as possible?</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er is really powerless now. She screams and roars thousands of times in her heart... I hope someone here can discover her existence soon.</p>

    <p>But what makes Sun Ying'er feel even more desperate is that she is now unable to make a sound at all. And the most important thing is that the binding between Shadows has also failed. Wang Ying cannot use Shadow to sense her own existence.</p>

    <p>This idiot is a ****! He is usually so cunning and witty. Why can't he find out about his existence?</p>

    <p>She thought that after she had been tortured by Wang Ying's Planet thumping technique countless times, the two of them should have a high level of understanding with each other.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it failed at the critical moment...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is sad inside.</p>

    <p>Of course. After thinking about it carefully, she felt that she could not completely blame Wang Ying for not being able to discover herself.</p>

    <p>After all, no one would have thought that she was so far away and right in front of them...</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>She came to Eternal Time. The character who traveled through time was the child in the belly of the Holy Stone Sect saint played by Wang Zhen!</p>

    <p>At first, Sun Ying'er didn't realize this. She thought she was just trapped by some formation.</p>

    <p>However, the slap Liu Qingyi gave Wang Zhen after seeing her shocked her awake...</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Sun Ying'er's heart was extremely broken.</p>

    <p>She is really miserable!</p>

    <p>It's such a scam!</p>

    <p>Why do people who travel to eternity play the role of an emperor! A goddess! A rich second generation with a huge fortune! No matter how bad she is, she is still a maid who follows the prince!</p>

    <p>She is just a baby who can't move and has zero fighting ability!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er found that her mentality was really broken.</p>

    <p>The key is that she is really scared. What if the plot ends and no one has found her yet? Will she follow the big guys back to modern times?</p>

    <p>If she is unfortunate enough to be left alone in this eternity, how should she go back...</p>
