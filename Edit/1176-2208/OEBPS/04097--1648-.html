  <h1>Chapter 1648 Zhuo Yi's ominous premonition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The entrance to the underground boxing ring in the slums of Science and Technology City is at the entrance of a deep alley on the Fifth Ring Road street. There is a closed manhole cover in the depth. After opening the manhole cover, you will find the entrance.</p>

    <p>And at the entrance of this alley is a mechanical cultivator holding a gun.</p>

    <p>These strong men blocked the door and covered their mouths tightly. They looked like a human wall, adding a layer of mystery to this restricted area.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi arrived here. They were all receiving glances from these people.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shrank his neck. There was a vague premonition...</p>

    <p>It's not that I'm afraid of these strong men with big heads and thick necks. It's that I feel an inexplicable coldness behind them.</p>

    <p>And this was not the first time he had felt this coldness.</p>

    <p>It has actually appeared vaguely since I bought drinks.</p>

    <p>Until now. It's getting stronger and stronger...</p>

    <p>After showing the betting ticket leading to the underground, one of the strong men spoke. His voice was thick and low, without any emotion at all: "One ticket. You can only enter two at most."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong became wise in his desperation. He took out a silver gear coin from his pocket. He showed his white teeth and smiled and said: "Brother, why don't you be accommodating. I was also introduced by a friend. Come here to play. I don't know if I can still buy it."</p>

    <p>The strong man took the money and smelled the aroma.</p>

    <p>This silver gear coin is worth one hundred thousand. For Zhuo Yi and others who are in urgent need of funds, it is actually a large amount of money.</p>

    <p>But Qin Zhong was unusually generous. He immediately raised his lips and said, "If this eldest brother doesn't dislike it, just share it with the brothers."</p>

    <p>The paralyzed strong man smiled coldly: "You are still a man of etiquette. Then come in."</p>

    <p>Then, he just winked and the other strong men gave way directly.</p>

    <p>"So he's the boss here?" Qin Zhong knew it in his heart when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>The three of them had just walked into the alley from the human wall. He found that the strong man who had collected the money had also come in. As if he wanted to say something to him: "Is this your first time here, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It's the first time." Qin Zhong answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>"The betting odds for the final are 1:6. Most people think Jian Xiaoqiang will win. But it's no fun to bet on the final."</p>

    <p>The big man said in a gruff voice: "If it's your first time here, sir. I suggest that you play the tournament handicap. The odds are 1:60, but the entry fee for this game. It's 1 million silver gear coins. I see you're so generous. Do you want to play an exciting game?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Qin Zhong's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>He just gave a 100,000 tip to the strong man, and he still has 1 million left!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi followed Qin Zhong. He sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>All these coincidences are simply natural...as if they were designed...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Now found out. Qin Zhong may not just be lucky.</p>

    <p>He might be the embodiment of luck or maybe...</p>

    <p>Sixty times the odds! If they can win! They can get 60 million Silver Gear Coins!</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong's face was full of interest: "Then how are we going to get in?"</p>

    <p>The strong man showed an ugly smile. He walked directly to the innermost place and opened a manhole cover hidden under the blanket: "Three gentlemen, come in from here. This is the VIP passage."</p>

    <p>"That's it. Thank you." Qin Zhong nodded.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome, sir. I wish you good fortune," the strong man said. He watched Qin Zhong and the others go in with a smile, and then covered the manhole cover and carpet again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The underground boxing ring in the VIP area. It was a little different from Zhuo Yi, Qin Zhong imagined.</p>

    <p>These people are brightly dressed. Just from their dress and appearance, they have escaped the aura of poverty.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned slightly: "These people are from the core area..."</p>

    <p>He could probably guess something from the scene before him.</p>

    <p>The final plate is only 1:6. In the final analysis, it is just a poor man's plate... and this Martial Arts Competition is the real big plate. It is a place for the rich and powerful to find excitement.</p>

    <p>Betting service desk.</p>

    <p>Many people are talking about the Martial Arts Competition. "Hey, it was a pity for the man earlier. He reached the fourth level. But he was beaten up and carried away by the attention of the fourth level."</p>

    <p>"Who can fight with a sword? I am the Tiger General! In my opinion, this year's Martial Arts Competition, Hu Baoguo will definitely win." A middle-aged man with a big belly laughed with a sinister face. He pinched A tall wine glass. While talking carelessly, he shook the red wine in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Don't get too excited, Mr. Zhong. The game is not over yet." An aristocrat with big red lipstick smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>"There are only 4 hours and 52 minutes left before the deadline for betting. If you want to challenge last year's championship through five levels in less than five hours, I think it is impossible." This middle-aged man named Mr. Zhu He let out a wild laugh without concealing it.</p>

    <p>He is a supporter of last year's Martial Arts Competition winner Hu Baoguo.</p>

    <p>At that time last year, Hu Baoguo was spotted by a person who wanted to "ascend" from the slums. He was provided with the initial capital to participate in the Martial Arts Competition.</p>

    <p>The so-called "ascended people" are those who have accumulated a certain amount of money and want to escape poverty and move to the core area.</p>

    <p>In the first two years of the Martial Arts Competition, there were ascendants who participated in the competition themselves, but ended up dying here.</p>

    <p>Later, some "ascended ones" came up with a way.</p>

    <p>That is to sign a fighter to compete for you.</p>

    <p>After the game is completed, the ascendant gets the pass. The thugs get their own money.</p>

    <p>With this money, the thugs will have the capital to continue competing in the second year.</p>

    <p>And he can also become the champion for the second year.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the Martial Arts Competition has been held for dozens of times. This has become an unwritten rule.</p>

    <p>And Ducas, the director who collaborated with Jiugong Liangzi, is actually one of the "Ascendants."</p>

    <p>These people were chatting lively.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Qin Zhong and Zhou Ziyi also heard some clues.</p>

    <p>In other words, the new challenger needs to defeat five gatekeepers selected by the powerful. And only after all challenges are successful, can they challenge last year's kicking king.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that all the gatekeepers who guard the gate have spare tires. Once they are injured, they will be replaced by new people to guard the gate.</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter who comes to challenge, the first five level masters faced will always be five people with full health, mana and full status.</p>

    <p>"It sounds like it's not easy to handle. Do you really need to deposit it?" Zhuo Yi frowned. It was just based on his feeling. He also felt that this rule was too strict.</p>

    <p>There are less than 5 hours left.</p>

    <p>Challenge 6 people in a row.</p>

    <p>Unless there is a huge gap in strength. But this is an almost impossible task.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zhu also knew this very well. He laughed again: "As far as I know, there is still some spare money in the ten rings to fund the competition. That is the director named Ducas. But. It's a pity that the contracted thug he sent has died just now. There are less than five hours left. I don't necessarily want him to rush the ducks to the shelves. Can I just grab someone on the way?"</p>

    <p>After the man finished speaking, there was a burst of laughter in the hall.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong ignored it. Instead, he walked towards the bet desk. He took out the storage bag where the money was placed and said, "Hello. Can I still bet now?"</p>

    <p>"Of course sir." The waitress who made the bet showed a professional smile.</p>

    <p>"Please protect me. This Mr. Hu Baoguo. Lose."</p>

    <p>"Is that a bet, sir? I checked. There is one million Silver Gear Coins in your storage bag."</p>

    <p>After the waitress finished speaking, many eyes were focused on Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled slightly: "Please put me in. Let's go."</p>
