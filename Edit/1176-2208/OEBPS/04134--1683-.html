  <h1>Chapter 1683 Recovery</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, a huge earthquake occurred in the entire supreme world. Just because of this "Zhou Ziyi bullet!"</p>

    <p>The expression on Nawei's face was initially unperturbed. Because the New Ancient Divine Weapons in his body are dividing like cells. The strength of his body is not weak. Xiang Yi's bullet that concentrated his cultivation. He won't be afraid even if it takes tens of thousands of years.</p>

    <p>But when he saw that everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception was united as one. Everyone used their special skills to focus on the bullet. His heart, which had been so still, finally couldn't help but jump.</p>

    <p>He never expected that the Nine Sun Divine Sword actually had such a gameplay.</p>

    <p>Using a living human being as a bullet. This is the first time Nawei has ever seen such an ingenious maneuver, even with his extensive knowledge inherited from the God Brain.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>He felt a sense of tension in his brain.</p>

    <p>If you were hit by this bullet!</p>

    <p>No doubt about it. He will die!</p>

    <p>Therefore. Never let this happen!</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the sky, endless thunder strikes, destroying everything. Time in the supreme world seems to have frozen. Gravity is adjusted. All the power is condensing and exploding. Just to stop Zhou Ziyi from sniping towards the head. Bullets!</p>

    <p>At this moment, a violent roar caused the world to collapse. Endless powerful aura spread here, covering the entire void. Countless cracks were formed in the supreme world from all directions.</p>

    <p>The boulders in the entire supreme world floated and rushed towards the designed bullet, trying to weaken its power.</p>

    <p>However, Leng Ming's sword energy protection was particularly good.</p>

    <p>That little glistening green light seems to be nothing compared to the collapse-like darkness of the entire supreme world. However, it plays a vital role, guarding the bullets as they move forward bravely.</p>

    <p>"Stupid future generations. You don't know what the Ancient Power is..." Nawei was filled with dissatisfaction. Because among the people in the Office of Strategic Deception. Except for Monk Jin Deng, almost none of them can be called a true Vanguard. Even those who came out of the Secret Realm of Time. They're just defective products of a quick fix.</p>

    <p>There is no understanding of the high and noble ideals of a Vanguard.</p>

    <p>The real Eternal Ones. But the people who have truly lived from that era to the present! Their memories are a whole story. They control the long-lasting epic that ordinary cultivators cannot reach...</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that Nawei wants to use his own strength to face up to the value difference between these cultivators of later generations. As an old-timer, he will tell these young cultivators what it means to not be in the same dimension. Hierarchical dimensionality reduction attack.</p>

    <p>But now, with this Zhou Ziyi bullet that is about to kill him, Nawei's mind begins to waver. He begins to doubt whether his thoughts are wrong. He even once felt that he was not true. 's old.</p>

    <p>Face this indomitable bullet.</p>

    <p>At this time, Nawei found that all his efforts to stop it seemed to be in vain.</p>

    <p>This Zhou Ziyi bullet is too powerful. It has the power to destroy the world. It's as if it can cut off karma. In this brief moment, no matter how much Nawei used his mind to visualize the future of this bullet. His mind went blank.</p>

    <p>"You can actually do this..." Nawei's spirit fell into a brief stagnation at this moment.</p>

    <p>"What a pity. It's just a little bit close. I will be invincible..."</p>

    <p>He said this. Then he sighed softly. Then he slowly closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>This Zhou Ziyi bullet, with the joint efforts of everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception, finally accurately penetrated Nawei's forehead and hit the red heart!</p>

    <p>His whole head exploded in an instant!</p>

    <p>The body and head were separated, but not even a trace of blood flowed out. The moment the bullet passed through, it was directly swallowed by the space.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei did not expect that this tacit attack that gathered everyone's combined efforts would be surprisingly effective.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, what should I do with Ziyi...if I don't stop him, he will keep flying..." It wasn't until he finished shooting that Zhuo Yi suddenly thought of this problem.</p>

    <p>"No. My Nine Sun Divine Sword has a resource return function. The bullets fired will eventually return to me. Brother Ziyi is no exception." Xiang Yi said with a smile: "But I really didn't expect it. Human bullets."</p>

    <p>"But. Did we really kill him?" Er Ha was a little skeptical about this.</p>

    <p>Nawei just now. It was really close to being invincible...</p>

    <p>As long as the divine brain is fully developed and reaches 100% activation state, I am afraid that even with Wang Nuan's current strength, it may be difficult to fight Nawei alone before he matures in a few years.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed dead. I can feel that Nawei's breath has disappeared. It is completely gone." At this time, Qin Zhong said. But having said that, the expression on his face was different from Er Ha. with a certain solemnity.</p>

    <p>Nawei At the moment of death, Qin Zhong felt that he realized many things.</p>

    <p>These eternal beings have been pursuing supreme power since ancient times. Even until recently, they regarded the cultivators of later generations as ants. This can be said to be the entrustment of the eternal beings.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the standard of the cultivation world in later generations is indeed not as good as the era of eternity when heroes were contending.</p>

    <p>Although what we are focusing on now is the era of scientific cultivation for all, I don't know whether it has progressed or regressed compared to the past.</p>

    <p>All of this is hard to say.</p>

    <p>Everyone waited in the Supreme World for a while. They originally planned to wait until the Supreme World became more collapsed after Nawei died and then focus their fire to create a breach to escape.</p>

    <p>But soon, Lord Diulei suddenly discovered that the division of this supreme world seemed to have suddenly stopped at a certain moment.</p>

    <p>"Eh? How is it possible..."</p>

    <p>He frowned.</p>

    <p>The master of the supreme world is dead. Then it is only a matter of time before the world collapses.</p>

    <p>"No, it's not over yet." At this moment, Monk Jin Deng saw a holy light in front of him. Without thinking, he shrunk into an inch, turned into a rainbow and walked over.</p>

    <p>The rest of the Office of Strategic Deception followed closely.</p>

    <p>Then the scene in front of them made everyone stunned again.</p>

    <p>In the void, there is actually a human brain shining with silver light that is condensing.</p>

    <p>"The brain... is 100% activated!" Jin Deng immediately knew what happened.</p>

    <p>It turns out that at the last moment when the bullet shattered the divine brain, Nawei's divine brain was still 100% activated simultaneously.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why...</p>

    <p>Jin Deng has a feeling.</p>

    <p>He felt that the person who was resurrected at this time was no longer Nawei.</p>

    <p>Instead, it is filled with an aura of old age, loneliness, loneliness and death...</p>

    <p>A "chi" sound.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming slashed through with one sword.</p>

    <p>As a result, his sword energy did not affect the divine brain itself. This divine brain was actually illusory. It was not in the same space as them!</p>

    <p>Instead, he used a method of spatial differentiation to hide himself!</p>

    <p>Then. It continued to bloom with silver light. It began to center on the brain, and derived blood vessels. Finally, it formed a spiral shape. Bit by bit, it converged into the appearance of the handsome young man before...</p>

    <p>But at this moment, when the young man spoke, it was no longer the voice of Nawei.</p>

    <p>"Jin Deng. It's been a long time. Are you okay?" The young man raised his lips and smiled, getting familiar with his new body.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng sighed and responded: "Wu Xin. After all... you still survived in this way."</p>

    <p>The person in front of me is not someone else.</p>

    <p>It is Nawei's master. Master Wu Xin himself...</p>

    <p>At that time, he was the only one who deceived Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>
