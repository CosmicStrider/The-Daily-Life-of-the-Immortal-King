  <h1>Chapter 1313 Father Wang also wants to get pregnant</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa. Mother Wang, who was knitting a sweater, suddenly felt a stomachache.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang put down her tools and grabbed Father Wang's hand: "It suddenly hurts..."</p>

    <p>"You're not going to give birth, are you?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang was nervous for a while. He saw Mother Wang sweating on his forehead in pain. He felt distressed and said, "Let's go to the hospital!"</p>

    <p>But soon. Mother Wang shook her head: "No need."</p>

    <p>The pain came and went quickly. Mother Wang has already recovered. And the amniotic fluid hasn't broken yet... Generally speaking, it's not serious.</p>

    <p>I usually experience sudden labor pains like this. But this time, it seemed to be particularly painful.</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan must be naughty again." Father Wang touched Mother Wang's belly. He couldn't help laughing and said, "Ah Nuan, you have to be more obedient. You are so naughty. Mom can't bear it."</p>

    <p>"I think Ah Nuan must be like this because of something important." Mother Wang said with a smile.</p>

    <p>With a loving expression on his face: "And I found that every time I feel pain, my body becomes better. Have you noticed? I feel a lot stronger recently, and the fine lines on my face are reduced!"</p>

    <p>"I am much stronger..." Father Wang was stunned.</p>

    <p>Can this pregnancy also have an awakening effect?</p>

    <p>Father Wang thought this was a bit "weird"... but he quickly reacted.</p>

    <p>"No way..." Father Wang muttered silently.</p>

    <p>"What can't you do?" Mother Wang asked.</p>

    <p>"Dear, wait for me!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang immediately ran back to the study on the second floor. He took out a device that looked like a blood pressure machine. Then he put a strap on Mother Wang's head.</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>"The realm tester... all realms below the Nascent Soul stage can be tested with this device." Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>As a Muggle couple who have been in the physical training period all year round, Father Wang has actually thought about when to enter the path of cultivation. So he looks forward to his "awakening" every day.</p>

    <p>What needs special emphasis here is.</p>

    <p>What Father Wang hopes is that he can awaken.</p>

    <p>Instead of relying on the power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Soon. The results of the realm tester will be out.</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared at the results displayed on the dashboard and gasped.</p>

    <p>"What happened?" Mother Wang was confused.</p>

    <p>"Damn it... you have a Foundation Building!" Father Wang was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>"I... I have a Foundation Building?" Mother Wang was also shocked.</p>

    <p>Their spiritual roots are so useless. They can actually do this...</p>

    <p>"No wonder I said. My health is getting better and better recently."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang touched her belly. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry: "But it wasn't like this when I was pregnant."</p>

    <p>"Daughters and sons are different. The son is Huaxiu Construction Bank. The daughter is Huaxiu Merchants Bank... This will bring the aura of heaven and earth to you. It will give you a Foundation Building."</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared at the dashboard. He felt envious.</p>

    <p>After a while, he looked at Mother Wang seriously: "Tell me, can I have one too?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In space. The location near the moon. Wang Ling is face to face with Mr. Gray Fog.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Gray Mist Lord's body is smaller than Wang Ling imagined. However, the density of the body is really amazing.</p>

    <p>Small body. Has huge weight.</p>

    <p>And it's obviously no longer the five-ton level.</p>

    <p>It has been a long time since Dao Ancestor Wang fed him. Although the prairie dog said he hated being treated as a pet, under the various delicacies fed by Dao Ancestor Wang, his body had already been transformed into a completely different animal. foodie.</p>

    <p>In addition to causing trouble in various places over the years.</p>

    <p>What prairie dogs do most is eat and eat.</p>

    <p>As a result, I now have an alarming weight. (Just like you who have been gaining weight at home during the epidemic)</p>

    <p>"Your eyes are very interesting. They can actually see through my chaotic gray fog." At this time, Mr. Gray Fog stared at Wang Ling. He was admiring Wang Ling's pair of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Red eyes.</p>

    <p>When the power is operating, the entire pupil will be rendered golden and turn into lotus petals that spread out.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling has only unlocked less than 5% of its power. But it has already made Lord Gray Mist feel a strange sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>You know. Even the "Swastika" by monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>He doesn't mean anything.</p>

    <p>There are really not many people who can put pressure on him with their eyes. Apart from Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>"I can clearly sense that you are definitely not the reincarnation of Lord Dao Ancestor... Who exactly are you?" The prairie dog stared at Wang Ling. He became curious about Wang Ling's identity.</p>

    <p>As for these lines, Wang Ling's ears have already become calloused.</p>

    <p>Why does everyone have to ask who he is before fighting him? Where he comes from? Who is he...</p>

    <p>He doesn't even know who he is!</p>

    <p>Forget it. Let's resolve the battle in front of us as soon as possible...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling estimates that the Cat in the Abandoned Land is probably watching this battle now.</p>

    <p>Cat in the Abandoned Land is already impatient about teaching a prairie dog a lesson.</p>

    <p>So he must complete the agreement with Cat in the Abandoned Land as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>In this way, Sun Rong will have another layer of protection.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>There was a muffled sound.</p>

    <p>In the universe, Wang Ling's entire person disappeared out of thin air!</p>

    <p>"Shrunk to an inch..."</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Fog reacted quickly. He immediately increased the concentration of chaotic gray fog to surround himself.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Gray Fog Vestment formed by the Chaos Gray Fog is a natural damage reduction weapon. As long as the Chaos Gray Fog exists! He will be sure of the battle situation!</p>

    <p>As long as he can use this ability flexibly, Mr. Gray Mist is even sure that he can fight without any injuries during the entire battle!</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ling's palm without any modification.</p>

    <p>There are no bells and whistles. Just a simple hand slash.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to hurt me with such a normal attack?" Mr. Gray Mist sneered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He hid in the chaotic gray fog and closed his eyes. He didn't care at all which direction Wang Ling would attack from. He was confident that he would not be hurt by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But the next moment, a scream came.</p>

    <p>It was a very standard prairie dog scream.</p>

    <p>"Ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling hand slash passing through the chaotic gray mist accurately. It landed accurately on the spine of Mr. Gray Mist.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The whole prairie dog was like a meteor falling from the sky. It hit the surface of the moon, leaving a deep crater...</p>

    <p>"Can actually penetrate the gray mist of chaos..."</p>

    <p>The groundhog spit out a small mouthful of blood and crawled out of the pit.</p>

    <p>Another blow didn't kill you...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>However, this is within Wang Ling's expectation.</p>

    <p>After all, this is the sacred beast raised by Dao Ancestor Wang. If it were destroyed by him with just one blow, how shameless would Dao Ancestor Wang be?</p>

    <p>And most importantly, the Groundhog thought he was injured because Wang Ling's hand slash had pierced through his "Chaos Gray Mist."</p>

    <p>But in fact. Wang Ling is not broken.</p>

    <p>The chaotic gray mist around Mr. Gray Mist has indeed played the role of "damage reduction."</p>

    <p>And the reason why he is injured now is that there is no other fancy reason.</p>

    <p>It was only because of Wang Ling's hand slash.</p>

    <p>The damage is too high.</p>

    <p>"I have to be serious, human being!" At this time, Mr. Gray Mist crawled out of the pit and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>He increased the concentration of the chaotic gray mist again.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he extended his claws to Wang Ling that he claimed could crush everything!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The groundhog stepped hard and was suddenly launched from the surface of the moon!</p>

    <p>Result. Three seconds later...</p>

    <p>Another standard prairie dog scream came: "Ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>Just beside the deep pit that was just formed. There is a second deep pit...</p>

    <p>"Not dead yet..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stared at the two deep craters on the moon's surface. Smoke emanated from his palms.</p>

    <p>This groundhog.</p>

    <p>Strong but not strong.</p>

    <p>The blood is really thick...</p>
