  <h1>Chapter 1363 Yang Shuangji's true identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying didn't know why she hated Yang Shuangji so much.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because of Yang Shuangji's arrogant face;</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because of Yang Shuangji's arrogant and arrogant attitude;</p>

    <p>Or maybe it's even simpler. Just because Yang Shuangji bullied Sun Ying'er...</p>

    <p>These emotions were mixed together. The anger in Wang Ying's heart was almost ready to come out.</p>

    <p>The next battle can be said to be without any suspense. The gap between Wang Ying and Wang Ling is only one King's Eyes. Naturally, Yang Shuangji cannot be Wang Ying's opponent.</p>

    <p>He pinched Yang Shuangji's neck, cut off Yang Shuangji's tongue, and finally broke his fingers one by one.</p>

    <p>These evil hands filled with filth seemed to Wang Ying to be creepy and disgusting.</p>

    <p>{Shadow Execution Song}. This is the most terrifying of all Wang Ying's Shadow spells. Ranked first!</p>

    <p>Its power is second only to the {Shadow Ball} used against the groundhog previously.</p>

    <p>But once it is carried out, it will make people feel the feeling of inhumane abuse. The heartbreaking harm conveyed will not kill people, but it can make a person's spirit be destroyed by the constant abuse...</p>

    <p>Finally. Collapse.</p>

    <p>{Shadow Ball} is a confinement-type destruction spell. Every second you stay in the Shadow Ball will cause damage equivalent to one slap of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ying felt that using the {Shadow Ball} would be too advantageous for him when dealing with someone like Yang Shuangji.</p>

    <p>And {Shadow Execution Song} is perfect for inflicting on Yang Shuangji.</p>

    <p>Striped shadows struck from all directions, like spears, passing through Yang Shuangji's body.</p>

    <p>One of them was stabbed directly from Yang Shuangji's mouth. Yang Shuangji's throat was penetrated by a strip of shadow to the bottom, and then passed out from the sole of the foot.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ying's abuse did not end there. His eyes were red and he had entered a violent state.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ying that Sun Ying'er has never seen before.</p>

    <p>This made the girl suddenly feel afraid.</p>

    <p>In a violent state, Wang Ying commanded thousands of strips of shadow. Unexpectedly, he poked too many holes in Yang Shuangji's body...</p>

    <p>He kept repeating his actions.</p>

    <p>Like a cold, emotionless machine.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er finally couldn't stand it anymore. She stepped forward and hugged him from behind: "That's enough! Wang Ying! He's dead!"</p>

    <p>This call finally made Wang Ying wake up.</p>

    <p>The red light in his eyes faded.</p>

    <p>In the core world, everything returns to tranquility.</p>

    <p>Only Yang Shuangji's battered, mutilated body remained.</p>

    <p>At this point, everything has been executed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying inserted his hand into Yang Shuangji's Dantian.</p>

    <p>As soon as Yang Shuangji died, his inner core world was already collapsing.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ying can feel it. There is someone hidden in Yang Shuangji's core world.</p>

    <p>Then, Zhao Qingxian was pulled out completely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying grabbed Zhao Qingxian's neck. Zhao Qingxian was so frightened that he lost his mind: "Senior! Senior, don't kill me! I was coerced by him!"</p>

    <p>"The son of the head of the Zhao family in the Divine Realm?" Wang Ying read out the origin of this person.</p>

    <p>We also know the reason why Zhao Qingxian and Yang Shuangji are hanging out together.</p>

    <p>Previously, Zhao Qingxian said: "He only has Liu Qingyi in his heart."</p>

    <p>This sentence actually saved Zhao Qingxian's life.</p>

    <p>I realized that Zhao Qingxian had no ill intentions towards Sun Rong himself.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ying finally took Zhao Qingxian out of the core world and threw him on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for not killing me, senior!" Zhao Qingxian quickly kowtowed and begged for mercy.</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji is such a strong person. He was tortured by Wang Ying so much that he had no room to resist... Such power made Zhao Qingxian have a clearer understanding of this trip to the earth!</p>

    <p>"Can you let go?" At this time, Wang Ying frowned and asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er still hugged him like a koala.</p>

    <p>"Ah...I'm sorry!" Sun Ying'er quickly let go of his hand: "But please understand! I just...didn't mean to hug you!"</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>"I didn't hug you just because I saw you angry and wanted to calm you down!"</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>"It's all...it's all because your core world is too cold!"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>Let the girl make these weak-sounding excuses.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, how did you know that I was in danger?" Sun Ying'er was curious.</p>

    <p>"You are too stupid. You are in danger at any time." Wang Ying replied looking at the girl.</p>

    <p>"Who is stupid!"</p>

    <p>"I have been observing for a long time. If it weren't for Miss Sun being in danger, I would never have taken action."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It's not because the leader guessed that you were in trouble." Wang Ying said expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>"You are not honest at all! Humph!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"Same for you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying shrugged. He stared at Sun Ying'er: "Tonight, you still owe me 200 times."</p>

    <p>"Why!!!"</p>

    <p>"It's not good to protect Miss Sun. You still need me to take action. Fortunately, you are the Lord of the Void." Wang Ying smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>"It's obviously you..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er listened to Wang Ying's words and wanted to go up and ravage Wang Ying's face. But she finally restrained her impulse.</p>

    <p>She wanted to explain that it was Wang Ying who limited her abilities.</p>

    <p>As a result, the words came to my lips, but I didn't dare to say them out.</p>

    <p>She knew that once she said it, she would be fooled by Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>The other party will definitely seize the opportunity and increase the number of punishments!</p>

    <p>"Just 200 times! Just punish me!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er stamped her feet angrily.</p>

    <p>Then he turned his attention to the inhuman Yang Shuangji: "What is going on with this person?"</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty has already calculated the origin of this person, so I still have to ask you." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Ask me? What does it matter to me!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er put her hands on her hips and showed an innocent expression.</p>

    <p>"This person is not the sage of Buddhism." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"How is this possible..." Zhao Qingxian, who was still kneeling on the ground, looked shocked: "But he clearly told me personally that he is Master Jin Deng's junior brother!"</p>

    <p>"Master Jin Deng's junior brother died a long time ago. How could a Buddhist disciple who was willing to die to save his own senior brother say these words that are insulting to Buddhism?" Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>After he finished speaking, Sun Ying'er observed Yang Shuangji carefully. The expression on his face suddenly became extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>"Have you noticed it?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er stretched out his hand. A light seal appeared in his palm. It was the Great Seal of the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>She stretched out her hand and covered Yang Shuangji's body.</p>

    <p>I saw that this bloody body turned into particles of light in an instant and disappeared.</p>

    <p>"This is...an imaginary creature?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. This person is an imaginary creature in the void world. He is also our old friend." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the thoughts of void creatures are all connected together.</p>

    <p>They live in a void and rely on various imaginations to obtain spiritual satisfaction and happiness.</p>

    <p>These things that are made up in the brain usually do not affect reality.</p>

    <p>However, there is still a very small chance that these "imagined things" will be reflected in real life...</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly.</p>

    <p>If the obsession is deep enough.</p>

    <p>Then you can use the power of the void to reimagine yourself.</p>

    <p>"I know. Void creatures are now under strict control. Such a situation is impossible. But you need to know. Your void world has long been unclean." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"You mean, those human cultivators who evolved into void creatures?" Sun Ying'er was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Only this reason can explain why a void creature has such a strong obsession."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said: "Jin Deng's junior brother is not named Yang Shuangji. However, this person packages himself as the sage of Buddhism and changes his name to Yang Shuangji. In fact, it is a hint to his true identity."</p>

    <p>"You mean he is..."</p>

    <p>"Yang. Symbolizes daytime and double auspiciousness. It is Zhe. It has the same pronunciation as zhe."</p>

    <p>"This person is still alive?!" Sun Ying'er was shocked.</p>

    <p>She inherited all the energy and information of the old Lord of the Void. Naturally, she also knew that there was such a number one person.</p>

    <p>But this person is already dead!</p>

    <p>All the Bai Zhes in the parallel world have been completely destroyed!</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that there are people with such strong obsessions in this world." At this point, Wang Ying couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe's obsession was incredible even to him.</p>

    <p>He is obviously dead!</p>

    <p>He actually used the last remaining thoughts he had left to use the identity of the deceased to forcefully reconstruct it in his own mind...</p>
