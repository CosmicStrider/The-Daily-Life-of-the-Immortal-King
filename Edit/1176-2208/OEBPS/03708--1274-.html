  <h1>Chapter 1274 The Unspeakable Place</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the atrium, the bricks symbolizing the reincarnation history of Zen Master Jin Deng exploded one after another.</p>

    <p>He spent his entire three thousand lifetimes in cultivation, but could only get a glimpse of its outline.</p>

    <p>This kind of thing sounds really sad.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reached out and planned to repair these broken memory bricks in the atrium.</p>

    <p>He had not stopped Jin Deng from snooping on him before. It was just because he also wanted to know what kind of existence he was.</p>

    <p>Now Zen Master Jin Deng has lost one of his eyes due to this reason, and his cultivation has also been greatly damaged.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that all the faults should not be placed on Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, the monk stretched out his hand to stop Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng shook his head and smiled bitterly: "I have lived 3910 lives. I didn't realize it until this life. I am not invincible... This loss of cultivation is a lesson. I must learn it. Zhenren doesn't have to take action." Helped."</p>

    <p>The monk coughed twice. He stretched out his hand and brushed his eyes. The previously scrapped "swastika" returned to normal pupils.</p>

    <p>Now he only has one "Swastika" left.</p>

    <p>The one that is scrapped has to start from scratch.</p>

    <p>But the monk has no regrets. Being able to fight against a real master like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if he is injured, for a monk, it is a scar full of glory.</p>

    <p>"My life in this life feels more exciting than all the previous ones." At this time, Zen Master Jin Deng said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Now there are only 910 bricks left in his atrium.</p>

    <p>He is now extremely looking forward to his passing away. He will turn the memories of this life into new bricks. Then spread them in this atrium and merge them with these 910 bricks...</p>

    <p>"Master, can you tell us now, Miss Sun Rong, what exactly is going on?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>This was the purpose why they came here to see Zen Master Jin Deng in the first place.</p>

    <p>And Zen Master Jin Deng knows so much. This does not make Wang Ling feel too strange.</p>

    <p>Although his fighting power is stronger than Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>However, the experience is always not as rich as that of Zen Master Jin Deng. The mental pressure in the memory brick is high. It does not mean that the experience is rich... The experience of 3910 lives is here. The monk knows more than himself. This is also being cleaned up.</p>

    <p>He is just a sixteen-year-old baby.</p>

    <p>In fact, the monk was not completely confident and sure about this matter.</p>

    <p>But after just taking a peek at Wang Ling's true identity.</p>

    <p>Now. Jin Deng already has his answer.</p>

    <p>Although he could only catch a glimpse of the outline and the chaotic world.</p>

    <p>But based on the clues he has now, the monk has reason to believe that what happened to the girl may be related to a mysterious place.</p>

    <p>"Do you know where Dao Ancestor Wang, who founded Heavenly Dao, founded Heavenly Dao?" Zen Master Jin Deng said: "Before Heavenly Dao was finalized, it is said that Dao Ancestor Wang conducted countless experiments to ensure The Heavenly Dao I designed can ultimately benefit eternity. It will benefit all cultivators."</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao still has a testing ground?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Wang Ling were both surprised.</p>

    <p>"According to legend, the test site was derived from a trace of chaos. It is a place with highly dense spiritual energy. It is difficult for ordinary creatures to survive in that place..."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Although the Heavenly Dao test site is just a rumor, the poor monk guarantees that this place does exist."</p>

    <p>"What's in the testing ground?"</p>

    <p>"They are all useless, yet full of evil and dark Heavenly Dao Golden Men. These Golden Men are all failed experiments. Dao Ancestor created them, but could not bear to destroy them..."</p>

    <p>Are the palms and backs of your hands full of flesh?</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>"These Heavenly DaoGolden Men who were not destroyed were left in that experimental site forever. They were completely sealed in it by Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng said: "And this place is also called: the unspeakable place."</p>

    <p>An unspeakable place...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This is really the first time I heard that there is such a place.</p>

    <p>"It's not that this generation of Heavenly DaoGolden Men has no memory of this place. It's just because Dao Ancestor was determined to hide this place forever. So he set up an unspeakable method. All Heavenly DaoGolden Men will temporarily forget it as long as they think of this place. Everything about the Heavenly Dao Proving Ground."</p>

    <p>Great shielding technique?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "Zhenren is right. This unspeakable method is indeed similar to the Great Shielding Technique. The Great Shielding Technique may have been derived from Dao Ancestor Wang's {Unspeakable Method}."</p>

    <p>"But Master, I'm still a little confused."</p>

    <p>"Sir, please tell me."</p>

    <p>"Why is the master so sure? Miss Sun's matter is related to the unspeakable place?"</p>

    <p>"I have two inferences. One. The ancient Golden Men who appeared next to Miss Sun are probably failed experiments that escaped from the unspeakable land. That girl has now become the child of the void. As the key to the door of the void. She In fact, there is huge energy hidden in the body..." Jin Deng's words were astonishing. He also clearly controlled the ins and outs of the whole matter.</p>

    <p>This kind of deduction ability makes Wang Ling feel amazed.</p>

    <p>This Jin Deng is indeed different from the other fish that I dealt with before.</p>

    <p>He is a capable monk.</p>

    <p>He didn't think about Jin Deng's words. He only heard the monk remain silent for a moment before continuing: "Those Golden Men are robbing. They just want to use the knife of void to tear the seal of the Unspeakable Land."</p>

    <p>"That's the seal set by Dao Ancestor Wang..." Lord Diulei was shocked.</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, the Son of the Void does have this ability."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Previously, the Lord of the Void went to such great lengths to search for the Son of the Void. I'm afraid the real purpose was not to invade the earth..."</p>

    <p>"Not for invasion?"</p>

    <p>"They want to protect the Son of the Void." The monk said: "As long as the Son of the Void returns to the Void, the curse on Miss Sun will not take effect. And the ancient Golden Men of the Unspeakable Land have no ability to run to the Void World. Find her."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this is what the Lord of the Void meant when he said that the Son of the Void will eventually return to the Void...</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling has learned everything about the whole thing from Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>This so-called yin-yang death calamity was originally the curse left by the ancient Golden Men in the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>So now. Here comes the crux of the problem.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei pondered for a moment and finally asked: "Master... then. Apart from returning to the void and becoming a part of the void, Miss Sun Rong, is there any other way to get rid of the entanglement of the ancient Golden Men?"</p>

    <p>"There is a way...of course...and I am afraid that only Ling Zhenren can do this now."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk turned his attention to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at him. His face was calm.</p>

    <p>Monk: "The way is to dump the entire Unspeakable Land in one pot."</p>
