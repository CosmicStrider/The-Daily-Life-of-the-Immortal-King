  <h1>Chapter 2121 Mr. Canghu's choice</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong was completely afraid to speak. Although she felt a familiar feeling from the Fuyun Town General Chen in front of her. On the other hand, she was also waiting for this "General Chen" to take the initiative to talk to her. Thus triggering the subsequent mission plot.</p>

    <p>However, it turns out that Sun Rong thought too much... Wang Ling. There are only a few lines in the whole book. Therefore, it is not likely that the number of words will directly increase in the game.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. Although he arranged the eighteen children in the general's mansion into a square formation, he was thinking of ways to let the children learn basic swordsmanship. But the arrival of Sun Rong made him feel for a moment At a loss.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he didn't expect that he would meet Sun Rong directly on the first map that could be called the Novice Village.</p>

    <p>The map in the world of Itinerant Immortal is too huge. There are thousands of map points based on small towns. As a result, he and Sun Rong happened to be allocated in the same place.</p>

    <p>So after recognizing Sun Rong, under the mask of General Huwei, the corner of Wang Ling's mouth couldn't help but twitch. I thought of Wang Ming giving him a bad smile when he first entered the game. Not sharing at all. Any information about Sun Rong... he could basically conclude that this wave was deliberately arranged by Wang Ming. Otherwise, there would be no such coincidence.</p>

    <p>The picture returns to the real world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhai Yin, and Shou Chong are monitoring everything happening in the game at the base.</p>

    <p>"Did you do it on purpose?" Zhai Yin asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"No." Wang Ming spread his hands helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Liar..."</p>

    <p>"Really not!"</p>

    <p>"Make it up... just make it up. I don't believe it..."</p>

    <p>He dared to swear on his personality and his future happiness. This time it was really a coincidence. He did not do it intentionally.</p>

    <p>In fact, when he entered the game before, Wang Ming really thought about whether to share the location directly. Let Wang Ling and Sun Rong reunite quickly. As a result, when he saw that the two coordinates fell directly at the same place, .I couldn't help but wipe my eyes immediately.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming subconsciously felt that he had seen it wrong...</p>

    <p>There are too many maps in the Itinerant Immortal magic circle. The probability of two players who know each other landing in the same novice village is one in 100,000...</p>

    <p>But this is the probability. Wang Ling and Sun Rong can actually meet.</p>

    <p>To be honest, when it comes to assists or not, Wang Ming also has his own thinking and understanding. He is not that old either. He is only a few years older than Wang Ling. Compared with Zhuo Yi's fancy assists. He actually understands Wang Ling better and will consider it from the perspective of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Assists in moderation are okay.</p>

    <p>But the effect of excessive assists is likely to have negative effects... just like some young people today who are constantly being urged to get married. Young people have their own ideas. They like to make their own decisions. They don't like to let their elders do it. Pointing fingers.</p>

    <p>Besides, this is still the world of cultivation. A monk's cultivation determines his longevity. The age span is very long... like Lord Diulei. He has practiced Taoism for more than two thousand years and is still a bachelor. Can you say that this is a big deal? Doesn't the leader of the sect have no ambition? He can't...</p>

    <p>Because his cultivation is here, he has strength and looks. The choice lies with Lord Diulei himself. He can find him whenever he wants. No one can rush him.</p>

    <p>So this time, Wang Ming did not specially arrange this matter.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the action of the Wall Breaker is a big deal. It is also the key to allowing those monks in Huaxiu abroad who are blinded by the wall of spiritual consciousness to see the reality clearly. The result is unimaginable. But this time he did not take any action. Wang Ling and Sun Rong actually appeared on a map instead.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows. Even if he jumped into the Yellow River, he wouldn't be able to clear up the matter. There are always thousands of mouths trying to explain it, but he can't explain it clearly. Even his wife doesn't believe him. It's simply too outrageous...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The focus returned to the game. This time Wang Ming surrendered his surveillance gaze to the world of Mr. Canghu who was on another map in the game.</p>

    <p>There are no surprises at all. The profession chosen by Mr. Canghu is [Reborn]. A profession with a balance of strength and intelligence. It also comes with a fragment of the world map at the beginning.</p>

    <p>In the Itinerant Immortal magic circle, all spirit beast settings and world view settings refer to the real world. That is to say, all the spirit beasts and various spiritual plants that appear in the game. Their living habits and growth habits are consistent with reality. There are almost no big differences.</p>

    <p>In other words, with Mr. Canghu's knowledge base, even in the game world of Itinerant Immortal, his tricks are completely useful.</p>

    <p>The equipment at the start of Wang Ling, Sun Rong is slightly different. Mr. Canghu checked his belongings. He found that in addition to coarse cloth clothes (white) and coarse cloth pants (white), there were more in the inventory. Got a storage bag (green).</p>

    <p>There is nothing in the storage bag. It is a one-time use. When opened, it will automatically expand an additional 500 spaces on top of the basic 500-space backpack.</p>

    <p>This also means that the reborn person can carry more things in the initial stage than other professions.</p>

    <p>After checking his health and hunger status, Mr. Canghu felt slightly relieved after everything was normal.</p>

    <p>He rarely plays games. But he more or less played them with a few idiot roommates when he was in college. It's just that the games back then were far less realistic than they are now. That's Tu Yile.</p>

    <p>In today's world, games have also become a way for young people to communicate. Who doesn't know a few netizens who don't know each other in real life, but in the game world, they can drink and talk to each other and talk to each other...</p>

    <p>Alright.</p>

    <p>Finished with emotion.</p>

    <p>The next step for Mr. Canghu is to put on the clothes in his inventory. Although they are two blank outfits, this game is immersive after all. Even if he looks like a Canghu. It's not very civilized to be naked.</p>

    <p>However, just when Mr. Canghu was about to put on his clothes, he found that the equipment he was given could not be worn.</p>

    <p>In front of me, system error prompts appeared frequently.</p>

    <p>[System: Please do not wear equipment of different races on yourself]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu didn't expect that he entered the game world. was actually despised by the game world...</p>

    <p>The corner of his mouth twitched. He almost couldn't resist the urge and cursed his mother directly.</p>

    <p>However, as a high-quality Canghu in the human world, he decided to endure it and use his profound knowledge to create a perfect start.</p>

    <p>After lighting up the map fragments, there was an area rich in resources on the map that was completely illuminated. And it was not far from the location of his Novice Village.</p>

    <p>But you have to go from here to that map to find resources. Walking with just two feet is too slow. You have to have the travel expenses to take a vehicle.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu looked at the initial money he carried. There were 500 copper coins in total. It was simply not enough.</p>

    <p>He thought about it carefully.</p>

    <p>Then I found a pawn shop in the novice village where I was born. I pawned two blank outfits that I couldn't wear. I scraped together a piece of silver...</p>
