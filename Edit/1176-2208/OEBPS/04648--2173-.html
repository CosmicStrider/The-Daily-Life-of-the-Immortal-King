  <h1>Chapter 2173 Dimensionality Reduction Strike</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In just a few days, Fuyun Town has become the center of the entire Itinerant Immortal world. Mr. Zanghu's elixir moving business has become better. Affected by the policies of Fuyun Town, he found that he took the initiative to seek help from himself. There are also more and more players joining in cooperation.</p>

    <p>These players all came from the outer city. They knew that there was a player in Fuyun Town who made his appearance look like that of a Tibetan fox. He unlocked hundreds of games in less than 72 hours of game play. Elixir formula.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly made some old players feel deeply hurt. They felt ashamed of themselves. They had unlocked hundreds of recipes on their own within three days. This was not something that stupid young people like them could compare to.</p>

    <p>The correct way for most players to unlock the elixir formula is to collect the alchemy materials. Then throw them into the alchemy furnace one by one according to the arrangement and combination to see the reaction.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the Itinerant Immortal spell ring is a game designed based on the rules of the real world of cultivation. As long as it is a recipe that actually exists in the real world, it can be synthesized in the game world as long as you know the synthesis method.</p>

    <p>But relying on this arrangement and combination to test the formula takes too long. Without the guarantee of a high-quality elixir furnace, refining an elixir in the game takes the same amount of time as in the real world.</p>

    <p>Unless you have a high-level alchemy furnace with you to refine the medicine. This will have the advantage of shortening the time.</p>

    <p>"It's strange. This person has only been here for no more than three days. Why does he know so many recipes?"</p>

    <p>In the distance, in a large cave, ten players who specialize in elixir formula research were puzzled by this. They saw that on the achievement list shared by the system, Mr. Zanghu's name had firmly ranked first. It left a lot of players in the world behind.</p>

    <p>The second player has only unlocked sixty-seven kinds of elixir formulas. Among them, there is 1 top grade, 10 top grade, 13 medium grade, 24 low grade, and 19 common grade.</p>

    <p>As for Mr. Zanghu, he has unlocked a total of 503 elixir formulas. There are more than 50 unique ones alone, accounting for one-tenth of the total formulas.</p>

    <p>"This is outrageous... Is this person a game master?"</p>

    <p>"Game administrators will not appear in this way. They will intervene in vicious struggles between players. But they will not steal business from players. This does not directly destroy the balance of the game. They exist to maintain the balance of the game. A group of people."</p>

    <p>"Too."</p>

    <p>Several players discussed the origin of Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, someone seemed to have remembered something and suddenly said, "Could it be...Mr. Cheng? Or someone related to Mr. Cheng?"</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, the cave immediately fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Players who are engaged in elixir research in the game world may also have a certain foundation in elixir courses in the real world. They may be graduate students majoring in elixirs at a certain Xiuzhen University. This is because the funds for manufacturing elixirs in the real world are not enough and the cost of trial and error is too high. High relationship. That's why I chose to enter the game world and conduct research in this roundabout way.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the greatest significances of Itinerant Immortal, a game based on the rules of the real world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>For monks who have studied elixirs, the name Mr. Cheng may not be unfamiliar to them.</p>

    <p>Sun Cheng.</p>

    <p>This is the legendary elixir formulator of the Huaguo Shuilian Group... He was once the successor of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. He is the most awe-inspiring person in the entire elixir circle.</p>

    <p>Sun Cheng is not only powerful himself. His wife is also a powerful helper. Her alchemy skills are superb. The combination of this pair of pill formulators and alchemists once caused a sensation in the entire world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But in an interstellar plane crash more than ten years ago, the two of them unfortunately died. Because the accident occurred in outer space, the bodies of Sun Cheng and his wife were not found.</p>

    <p>Today, the myth written by the two people still exists. It still makes the younger generations look up at the starry sky. It is beyond the reach of dust.</p>

    <p>For many years, this has been a sad and taboo topic for all those who work in the elixir industry.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Cheng back then was also known as the elixir formulator who could subvert the entire world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Such an unexpected event happened to such a powerful figure. This is something that no one expected. "But I remember that Mr. and Mrs. Sun Cheng have never had any apprentices..."</p>

    <p>"If he is a closed disciple, there is no way of knowing."</p>

    <p>Someone sighed and said, "They don't have a daughter. Now I think she is also a high school student in the Foundation Building period."</p>

    <p>"But when the accident happened, she was still too young. It is said that she did not fully inherit the legacy of her parents. It is a pity..."</p>

    <p>Many people have become sad when talking about this topic.</p>

    <p>"No. Aren't we discussing why this person can come up with so many recipes in such a short time?"</p>

    <p>"It's wild alchemy."</p>

    <p>A player with pink braids said: "Without using an alchemy furnace, use the wild alchemy method to make fire. As long as the materials are enough and the formula is correct, there is a chance to synthesize elixirs. But the quality of wild elixirs Often it's not enough. This is a disadvantage. The advantage is that it saves time. In addition, as long as the refining is successful, regardless of the quality, the number of recipes can be unlocked."</p>

    <p>"But as far as I know, there are very few seniors who know this method of alchemy..."</p>

    <p>A female player said: "Now this senior has settled in Fuyun Town. And he has directly received preferential policies there. He has taken over the original pharmacy in Fuyun Town and expanded it into a flagship store. But I feel that this senior's purpose is It's not that simple."</p>

    <p>With that said, the female player opened the map and analyzed the crowd: "This is a knowledgeable senior. If he knows so many alchemy methods, then I am wondering if there is a possibility. This senior wants to play now. A big one."</p>

    <p>The female player stretched out her hand and pointed at a volcano.</p>

    <p>When everyone saw this, they instantly took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>"Active volcano...alchemy..."</p>

    <p>Many people's voices trembled when they spoke.</p>

    <p>This is the oldest method of refining elixirs...many people know about it, but few dare to practice it.</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>At this time, in the large cave, a player in charge stood up: "We are all students of Jiulian University. We have been investing in research for so many years. Not just to make achievements in the research of elixir formulas. To catch up with Sun Become a senior?"</p>

    <p>"So, no matter who this legendary player who looks like a Tibetan fox is, I think this senior is worthy of our personal visit."</p>

    <p>After discussion, many people gradually understood that this was definitely an elder with extremely knowledgeable knowledge coming to play the game...a proper dimensionality reduction attack!</p>

    <p>If they can embrace the lap of such a great god, their future path will be broadened. This is not only a path in the game, but also a path in the real world.</p>
