  <h1>Chapter 2173 Dimensionality Reduction Strike</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In just a few days, Fuyun Town has become the center of the entire Itinerant Immortal world. Mr. Canghu's elixir moving business has become better. Influenced by the policies of Fuyun Town, he found that more and more players were taking the initiative to seek him out for franchise cooperation.</p>

    <p>These players all came from the outer city. They knew that there was a player in Fuyun Town who made his appearance look like that of a Tibetan Fox. He unlocked hundreds of elixirs in less than 72 hours of game play.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly made some old players feel deeply hurt. They felt ashamed of themselves. They had unlocked hundreds of recipes on their own within three days. This was not something that stupid young people like them could compare to.</p>

    <p>The correct way for most players to unlock the elixir formula is to collect the alchemy materials. Then throw them into the alchemy furnace one by one according to the arrangement and combination to see the reaction.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the Itinerant Immortal spell ring is a game designed based on the rules of the real world of cultivation. As long as it is a recipe that actually exists in the real world, it can be synthesized in the game world as long as you know the synthesis method.</p>

    <p>But relying on this arrangement and combination to test the formula takes too long. Without the guarantee of a high-quality elixir furnace, refining an elixir in the game takes the same amount of time as in the real world.</p>

    <p>Unless you have a high-level alchemy furnace with you to refine the medicine. This will have the advantage of shortening the time.</p>

    <p>"It's strange. This person has only been here for no more than three days. Why does he know so many recipes?"</p>

    <p>In the distance, in a large cave, ten players who specialize in elixir formula research were puzzled by this. They saw that on the achievement list shared by the system, Mr. Canghu's name had firmly ranked first. It left a lot of players in the world behind.</p>

    <p>The second player has only unlocked sixty-seven kinds of elixir formulas. Among them, there is 1 top grade, 10 top grade, 13 medium grade, 24 low grade, and 19 common grade.</p>

    <p>As for Mr. Canghu, he has unlocked a total of 503 elixir formulas, of which more than 50 were top-grade, accounting for one-tenth of the total formulas.</p>

    <p>"This is outrageous... Is this person a game master?"</p>

    <p>"Game administrators don't show up like this; they intervene in vicious conflicts between players. But they wouldn't compete with players for business—that would directly undermine the game's balance. They exist precisely to maintain that balance."</p>

    <p>"Also."</p>

    <p>Several players discussed the origin of Mr. Canghu.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, someone seemed to have remembered something and suddenly said, "Could it be... Mr. Cheng? Or someone related to Mr. Cheng?"</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, the cave immediately fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Players who engage in alchemy research in the game world likely have a certain foundation in alchemy courses in the real world. They may be graduate students majoring in alchemy at a certain cultivation university. Because the funds for making alchemy in the real world are insufficient and the cost of trial and error is too high, they choose to enter the game world to conduct research in this roundabout way.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the greatest significances of Itinerant Immortal, a game based on the rules of the real world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>For monks who have studied elixirs, the name Mr. Cheng may not be unfamiliar to them.</p>

    <p>Sun Cheng.</p>

    <p>This is the legendary elixir formulator of the Huaguo Shuilian Group... He was once the successor of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. He is the most awe-inspiring person in the entire elixir circle.</p>

    <p>Sun Cheng is not only powerful himself. His wife is also a powerful helper. Her alchemy skills are superb. The combination of this pair of pill formulators and alchemists once caused a sensation in the entire world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>However, the two tragically perished in an interstellar space disaster more than a decade ago. Because the incident occurred in outer space, the remains of Sun Cheng and his wife were never recovered.</p>

    <p>Today, the myth written by the two people still exists. It still makes the younger generations look up at the starry sky. It is beyond the reach of dust.</p>

    <p>For many years, this has been a sad and taboo topic for all those who work in the elixir industry.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Cheng back then was also known as the elixir formulator who could subvert the entire world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Such an unexpected event happened to such a powerful figure. This is something that no one expected. "But I remember that Mr. and Mrs. Sun Cheng have never had any apprentices..."</p>

    <p>"If he is a closed disciple, there is no way of knowing."</p>

    <p>Someone sighed and said, "They have a daughter. Now I think she is also a high school student in the Foundation Building period."</p>

    <p>"But when the accident happened, she was still too young. It is said that she did not fully inherit the legacy of her parents. It is a pity..."</p>

    <p>Many people have become sad when talking about this topic.</p>

    <p>"No. Aren't we discussing why this person can come up with so many recipes in such a short time?"</p>

    <p>"It's wild-caught alchemy."</p>

    <p>A player with pink braids said: "Without using a furnace, you can use the wild alchemy method to start a fire and refine pills. As long as you have enough materials and the recipe is correct, there's a chance you'll successfully synthesize a pill. However, the quality of wild pills is often not good, which is a drawback. The advantage is that it saves time, and also, as long as you succeed in refining, regardless of the quality, the recipe quantity will be unlocked."</p>

    <p>"But as far as I know, there are very few seniors who know this method of alchemy..."</p>

    <p>A female player said: "Now this senior has settled in Fuyun Town. And he has directly received preferential policies there. He has taken over the original pharmacy in Fuyun Town and expanded it into a flagship store. But I feel that this senior's purpose is not that simple."</p>

    <p>With that said, the female player opened the map and analyzed the crowd: "This is a knowledgeable senior. If he knows so many alchemy methods, then I'm wondering if there's a possibility that this senior is planning something big now."</p>

    <p>The female player stretched out her hand and pointed at a volcano.</p>

    <p>When everyone saw this, they instantly took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>"Active volcano... alchemy..."</p>

    <p>Many people's voices trembled when they spoke.</p>

    <p>This is the oldest method of refining elixirs... many people know about it, but few dare to practice it.</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>At this time, in the large cave, a player in charge stood up: "We are all students of Nine Lotus University. We've dedicated ourselves to research for so many years, all in the hope of making achievements in the study of elixir formulas and catching up with Senior Sun Cheng, right?"</p>

    <p>"So, no matter who this legendary player who looks like a Canghu is, I think this senior is worthy of our personal visit."</p>

    <p>After discussion, many people gradually understood that this was definitely an elder with extreme knowledge coming to play the game... a proper dimensionality reduction attack!</p>

    <p>If they can embrace the lap of such a great god, their future path will be broadened. This is not only a path in the game, but also a path in the real world.</p>
