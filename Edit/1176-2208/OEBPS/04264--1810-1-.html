  <h1>Chapter 1810 Wang Ling and Sun Rong are locked together</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A mysterious senior took action to save Levi's life. The entire Dark Wing team was seriously injured...</p>

    <p>This is the latest news received by Maiko Assi at dawn.</p>

    <p>The Dark Wing team that he originally assigned to capture Levis was carefully selected by Maiko Assi. All of them were talented people. In the end, with the help of a mysterious senior, an entire Dark Wing team was thwarted.</p>

    <p>Regarding this, Wang Ying on the other side was actually very aggrieved because he really didn't take action. If he really did, none of the members of the Dark Wing Brigade would go back alive.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that even if he didn't do anything, the Dark Wing team was still injured, and all of them had bruises and swollen faces. As for the most seriously injured person, the Dark Wing captain was still lying on a stretcher. Several ribs were broken.</p>

    <p>"General...General...I am a subordinate...doing things poorly..." He spoke weakly. His face was pale. Maiko Assi could tell that this was definitely not acting. It was actually that he was seriously injured.</p>

    <p>"There's no need to talk." Maiko Assi held his hand back. He was still a little touched by the desperate actions of these Dark Wing members. He could guess that the person who took action to save Levi was sent by the Office of Strategic Deception, and was probably an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>Facing a battle that was impossible to win, the Dark Wing captain still took the lead and led his brothers to charge forward...</p>

    <p>Although Maiko Assi did not see the scene at that time, he felt extremely moved when thinking about it.</p>

    <p>Facing this group of warriors, it was certainly impossible for him to criticize them too much.</p>

    <p>"You just rest in peace and recuperate. I already know the situation." Maiko Assi said. Although he is usually strict, he also has a compassionate heart towards his subordinates. As long as he does his best, he will not be embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Although what he didn't know was that this group of Dark Wings fought each other as hard as they could after Wang Ying left with Levis.</p>

    <p>If this were not the case, the captain of the Dark Wing Brigade felt that he might not survive this test.</p>

    <p>After seeing off the Dark Wing Brigade, Maiko Assi's expression fell into a long and solemn expression.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, Levis was most likely rescued by people sent by the Office of Strategic Deception. And he still doesn't know where Levis's specific location is.</p>

    <p>But if Levi could not be found, he was very worried that his plan to frame Levi would be revealed.</p>

    <p>"Report General!" At the gate of Xifeng Castle. At this time, an army soldier suddenly ran from a distance.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope wants to summon the general," said the soldier.</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope???"</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi was stunned. He fell into a blank state on the spot.</p>

    <p>He thought he heard wrongly.</p>

    <p>But after carefully recalling it, I was sure that it was the two words "Arch Pope." Only then did I come back to my senses in astonishment.</p>

    <p>That old man...</p>

    <p>Obviously he had passed...</p>

    <p>How come you suddenly came to life?</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi calculates. A possibility comes to mind.</p>

    <p>That's the Arch Pope. Maybe not the real Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>How can a dead person be resurrected?</p>

    <p>"Levis..." Maiko Assi chewed the name carefully. He curled his lips and sneered.</p>

    <p>He has probably already made a judgment on the matter.</p>

    <p>But that's fine too.</p>

    <p>It saves him the panic of searching for Levi's everywhere.</p>

    <p>Impersonating the Arch Pope. It's a capital crime...</p>

    <p>How dare this mafia boss...how could he have such courage to impersonate Yuan Zun, his old uncle?</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi smiled.</p>

    <p>He has a clear mind.</p>

    <p>The rest. As long as Levi's false identity is revealed, everything will be solved.</p>

    <p>Once Levi's dies, all the blame will be placed on Levi's body...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the person who was anxious at the same time was naturally Pei Luoqi, the leader of the Heavenly Dao League. As the source of the whole blaming incident, he thought that his action of blaming the death of the Arch Pope entirely on Maiko Assi was perfect.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. Because he also received an invitation from the church... saying that the Arch Pope wanted to consult with him.</p>

    <p>But the Arch Pope is obviously dead...</p>

    <p>What the hell is going on?</p>

    <p>"Dear, what should we do now?" Pei Luoqi's wife was very anxious and helpless. Her hair turned white overnight. She did not expect the situation before her at all.</p>

    <p>"I suspect that Maiko Assi may have guessed that this was a frame-up...that's why he did this." Peluoqi frowned and said, "How can a dead person come back to life..."</p>

    <p>"Then let's..."</p>

    <p>"It's better to stay put for now."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi said: "If my guess is correct, this Arch Pope should be a fake pope. It is most likely that Maiko Assi found someone to pretend. He wants to test our reaction. If I see the Arch Pope. There are too many shocked expressions. The secret will definitely be exposed. But now, I have to go."</p>

    <p>"Everything will be fine, right."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Everything will be fine."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi sighed endlessly in his heart. He tried to comfort his wife: "Don't worry. I won't reveal any flaws. As long as you firmly believe that the fake Arch Pope is the real Arch Pope, there will be no problem. Of course. If this matter doesn't end well in the end... there will be only one last step left."</p>

    <p>He did not continue.</p>

    <p>Because that's a really crazy and scary idea.</p>

    <p>To protect your family from being affected.</p>

    <p>As a last resort.</p>

    <p>He could only find a way to make this false pope die together with Maiko Assi...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone at Number 60 High School also received new news. And the source of the new news came from Maiko Abei, the daughter of Maiko Assi, and Pei Xiaoyuan, the son of Pei Luoqi.</p>

    <p>The two people did not provide any substantive valuable information. They simply described the current atmosphere at home. Because of the Arch Pope, the atmosphere on both sides seemed to be quite solemn.</p>

    <p>And almost all of this is within the calculation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the room, Sun Rong slightly covered her mouth, feeling stunned in her heart. She thought she had a comprehensive understanding of the boy. But after this incident, she felt that she had once again refreshed her understanding of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Tonight's Wang Ling. It's really not too much to call him Director Wang.</p>

    <p>Now, several forces in Glio City that were originally going to unite to deal with them are beginning to be suspicious of each other and a dog-eat-dog situation has arisen. Although he doesn't know what the final result will be. But when the other party is too busy to take care of themselves, they have to use their thoughts to deal with the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception. That would be too difficult.</p>

    <p>People are not united. Even if a relevant plan is forcibly drawn up, it will definitely be full of loopholes.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Wang Ling himself didn't expect it. He just arranged a few waves and completely disrupted the opponent's rhythm.</p>

    <p>So compared to these extremely weak forces, what is causing Wang Ling more headache now is the upcoming Variety Show Challenge.</p>

    <p>After all, in the first link.</p>

    <p>He and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Will be... locked together.</p>
