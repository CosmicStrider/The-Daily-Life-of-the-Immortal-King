  <h1>Chapter 2168 Qin Zhong's Book of Probability</h1>

  <div>

    <p>About ten minutes ago. Qin Zhong used his own method to learn Mr. Zanghu's next move.</p>

    <p>Catching the fugitive members of the Four Elephants was originally one of Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi's missions when they entered the game world. Now these people have been captured in real life. As a result, this group of data has been realized in the game world. It has become a real existence. "person."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi is very familiar with this routine of communication between the two worlds. Although it is a bit different from his own experience, the similarity is still there.</p>

    <p>For example, his famous puppet Wang Yuanxi. In a sense, Wang Yuanxi is also a fictional object that does not exist in the real world. But his will is preserved in some form.</p>

    <p>And later, with the help of Xiang Yi, Wang Yuanxi successfully ascended from the state of a puppet. He obtained a more powerful body and became more powerful than before.</p>

    <p>So. From the perspective of Xiong Wu and others in the game world who transform a bunch of data into real characters, this can also be regarded as a process of upgrading from two-dimensional to three-dimensional creatures.</p>

    <p>Like Wang Yuanxi, they have evolved. In theory, their strength at this time is more powerful than the real world.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly makes the current situation troublesome.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi only heard about the current situation from Wang Ming. But they had not received new instructions yet. Therefore, they did not dare to act rashly.</p>

    <p>This is the beginning of the chaos. And the person behind the chaos is still Bai Zhe. It should not be underestimated.</p>

    <p>It is very important to follow the formation command in a chaotic situation. Otherwise, I am afraid that the whole situation will develop in a more chaotic direction.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Qin Zhong returned the main task line to assist Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Since he had not yet established contact with Mr. Zanghu, Qin Zhong used his old method.</p>

    <p>This is a book of probability. It records various daily activities of a cultivator. These activities will also be expanded and detailed.</p>

    <p>For example, refining elixir.</p>

    <p>This is a big category.</p>

    <p>Then under Qin Zhong's refinement, this broad category was also divided into the following branches.</p>

    <p>Technology alchemy]</p>

    <p>1: Modern pressure cooker alchemy</p>

    <p>2: Modern hotpot alchemy</p>

    <p>3: Modern high-tech equipment for alchemy</p>

    <p>4: Modern induction cooker for alchemy</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>99: Modern workshop alchemy</p>

    <p>Ancient method of alchemy]</p>

    <p>1: Ancient method of alchemy furnace</p>

    <p>2: Ancient method of rubbing elixirs and refining elixirs</p>

    <p>3: Ancient method of quenching and alchemy</p>

    <p>4: Ancient method of active volcano alchemy</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>99: Sacrifice the author to make elixir</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong has made a very detailed division into each of the above categories.</p>

    <p>It's not just about elixirs. It also reflects on refining weapons, setting up formations, and various daily activities that a monk may engage in.</p>

    <p>In Xiang Yi's opinion, each of the listed things is so specific that it looks like a piece of program code.</p>

    <p>At first he didn't know the purpose of Qin Zhong listing these trivial things in detail.</p>

    <p>Until he and Li Ziye saw Qin Zhong's next move.</p>

    <p>"Please tell me what Mr. Zanghu plans to do next."</p>

    <p>Pointing at the temporary version of the book of probability that he had compiled, Qin Zhong began his performance. He put his hand on the book and asked a question with a sense of conviction.</p>

    <p>Then he started turning the pages.</p>

    <p>The page directly stopped at the section of the big page Alchemy] Ancient Methods Alchemy].</p>

    <p>"Please tell me how Mr. Zanghu plans to make the elixir."</p>

    <p>Then I heard Qin Zhong turn over it again with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>The answer finally revealed in this book of probability is "active volcano alchemy."</p>

    <p>"That's it. Mr. Zanghu's next step is to use active volcanoes to make elixirs." Qin Zhong closed the book again. He felt that he understood everything.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Next to them, Xiang Yi and Li Ziye were once again completely shocked by Qin Zhong's koi-like performance.</p>

    <p>What the hell...</p>

    <p>Is this okay?</p>

    <p>"Brother, let's just say this is a bit too hasty..." Xiang Yi was a little skeptical about this kind of performance. Although he had seen many similarly outrageous operations before.</p>

    <p>The lottery is directly the top prize. These are trivial things. Qin Zhong's reliance on the koi's physique to navigate is also very scary.</p>

    <p>For example, if he wants to find someone, he can do it with just a stick-shaped object.</p>

    <p>Just like now. Just call out that person's name and then throw it away. The direction the stick-shaped object points to is the direction where that person is now.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in order to correct the direction at any time, Qin Zhong will always have a toothpick on his body. In this case, he can place the toothpick on the palm of his hand for positioning.</p>

    <p>"It can't be wrong. This is the method I have used for a long time." Qin Zhong shook his head with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Although this book of probability is currently compiled by him, the major categories and details are not as comprehensive as the one in the real world. But it is still barely enough for now.</p>

    <p>Use the book of probability to find ways to answer the questions. Qin Zhong has tried every time.</p>

    <p>Of course, there are also cases where the answer cannot be read.</p>

    <p>For example, Qin Zhong cannot analyze Wang Ling's next move.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is too strong. It is impossible to figure out this man's next move. This is completely within Qin Zhong's expectation.</p>

    <p>Of course. In addition, there is another person, Qin Zhong, whose behavior cannot be analyzed at this stage...</p>

    <p>That is Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Compared with the mosaic that Bai Zhe got when trying to figure out Wang Ling, what Bai Zhe showed here was not that there was no result, but a blank page.</p>

    <p>This shows that Bai Zhe. Qin Zhong can actually pre-read at this stage. But this current book of probability is not as comprehensive as his original one from the outside world, so it cannot show the real answer.</p>

    <p>Faced with such "hasty" behavioral reasoning, if it were someone else, Xiang Yi would definitely not believe it. But this man is Qin Zhong... Xiang Yi has reasons that he has to believe.</p>

    <p>As for Li Ziye, he was outside the situation. It was completely unclear where these two people came from.</p>

    <p>I feel like I'm involved in something incredible...</p>

    <p>"Who are you two?" Li Ziye couldn't help but asked.</p>

    <p>"When the time is right, www.uukanshu.net will tell you."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong still answered accurately.</p>

    <p>Then he took out the toothpicks he had prepared and placed them in his palm.</p>

    <p>According to the position pointed by the toothpick, that direction is exactly the direction of Fuyun Town where Wang Ling is located.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Zanghu's next move is to go to Fuyun Town." Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"He wants to find the crater near Fuyun Town?"</p>

    <p>"This is the only possibility."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded: "Xiongwu has gone crazy. He is killing players everywhere. Mr. Zanghu's elixir layout has just been launched. According to Xiongwu's character, if he encounters Mr. Zanghu making elixirs in the wild using an active volcano, he will definitely attack him."</p>

    <p>"Now. In the entire Itinerant Immortal magic circle, the area around Fuyun Town is the safest place."</p>
