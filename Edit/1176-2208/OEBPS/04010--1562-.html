  <h1>Chapter 1562 A promising young man</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Replanting from a broken leg.</p>

    <p>This is an extremely clever method.</p>

    <p>Of course...this is not a technical capability possessed by cultivators currently on earth.</p>

    <p>At present, the method of continuation on earth still uses substitute materials, such as spiritual lotus root and the like.</p>

    <p>However, it is only used for cultivators whose physical bodies have been seriously destroyed. They use spiritual lotus roots to create a fake physical body, and then graft their soul into it.</p>

    <p>This is an extremely sophisticated operation. However, because the medical expenses are extremely expensive, it is not something that ordinary cultivators can afford.</p>

    <p>It's a project for the rich.</p>

    <p>The advantages and disadvantages of lotus root body are very obvious.</p>

    <p>Because it is too brittle, people who have been put into lotus root bodies are particularly vulnerable to being damaged. They should avoid strenuous exercise.</p>

    <p>Even flying with a sword is risky. Because Lotus Root Man's body is very light. If the sword is too fast, it will easily turn over.</p>

    <p>Even the Sword Controller has problems. Let's not talk about multiplayer sports.</p>

    <p>So in the final analysis, whether it is those substitute materials or Zhenren tissue transplanted from others.</p>

    <p>It is still far less useful than the original flesh on my body.</p>

    <p>With the level of cultivation on Earth, it is still not yet ready for mature leg-breeding technology. However, this technology is actually very mature on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Ever since Wang Ling gave the following power to several wealthy families on Heavenly Dao planet, the top ten families on Heavenly Dao planet had no time to curry favor with them.</p>

    <p>The young couple Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi have become messengers of communication between the Office of Strategic Deception and the Heavenly Dao star.</p>

    <p>The task of Wang Ling over there has just been assigned. Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi have already obtained the "method of growing legs."</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not much different from basic planting. You only need to make a hole in the incomplete part, then stuff the seeds in, and finally sew it up.</p>

    <p>All that's left is to bask in the sun every day and wait for the legs to grow.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to ensure that the broken leg can grow smoothly, the nutrition of the body also needs to be ensured.</p>

    <p>This process is equivalent to "fertilizing." But there is actually no need to soak the missing parts in fertilizer.</p>

    <p>That would be too harsh.</p>

    <p>You just need to keep eating to replenish your nutrients.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi came here this time. After seeing Zhou Ziyi's condition, I actually felt very relieved.</p>

    <p>He was worried that the young man would have a heavy psychological burden.</p>

    <p>Now seeing Zhou Ziyi's cheerful and optimistic look, this worry has obviously been dispelled.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he also had to observe Zhou Ziyi's specific injuries.</p>

    <p>The leg at the elbow cuts exactly one-third of the way to the thigh.</p>

    <p>In other words, part of the thigh is still there. It doesn't mean that the lower body has completely disappeared...</p>

    <p>Otherwise you'd have to plant the center leg. It's more trouble than it's worth.</p>

    <p>"Your condition is not bad. I think as long as you take good care of yourself, according to the proportion of your head and body, you will definitely be able to grow two long legs." Zhuo Yi said with his chin raised.</p>

    <p>"Is it really possible..." Zhou Ziyi was doubtful.</p>

    <p>"You have to be confident. Classmate Zhou." Zhuo Yi encouraged.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The implantation operation is actually very quick. However, in order to ensure that Zhou Ziyi's physical nutrition can be carefully supplemented and taken care of during the implantation period.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi decided here. Bring Zhou Ziyi home to help with the treatment.</p>

    <p>This is a task assigned by Wang Ling. As an apprentice, he must complete it.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that although Zhou Ziyi is 16 years old, he has a baby face. He looks like a child.</p>

    <p>In terms of age difference, when Zhuo Yi made this decision, I actually felt like an "old father" in my heart.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Senior Zhuo wants me to go to the senior's home?"</p>

    <p>After learning about Zhuo Yi's decision, Zhou Ziyi looked surprised: "But what about the flowers and plants in my yard..."</p>

    <p>"I have a friend named Immortal Toya. This time your implant surgery will be performed by him. And your flowers and plants will also be taken care of by his two apprentices."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled and said: "His two disciples usually take care of the flowers on an entire island. The few pots in your yard are too simple for them."</p>

    <p>"But wouldn't this be too much trouble?" Zhou Ziyi frowned.</p>

    <p>He was like a mirror in his heart. He clearly knew that his behavior would cause Zhuo Yi a lot of trouble.</p>

    <p>Although Zhou Ziyi has a broken leg, because of her cheerful personality, she is still very good at interpersonal communication.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi already understood this skill of observing words and emotions at a very young age.</p>

    <p>The reason for his concerns is not just because he doesn't want to trouble Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>More importantly, he felt that the girl following Zhuo Yi now would eat him alive...</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Zhou Ziyi raised his head and looked at Zhuo Yi. He changed his name by the way: "Brother Zhuo."</p>

    <p>"This is a good title. It sounds more friendly than senior."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded with satisfaction. He squatted down and looked at the young man in front of him patiently: "You can tell me whatever you have in mind."</p>

    <p>"I know Brother Zhuo is doing it for my own good. But it's really inconvenient for me to go there..." Zhou Ziyi buried his head, as if he had been holding it in for a long time. Finally, he suddenly raised his head and mustered up the courage to say: "Because I I don't want to be a light bulb!"</p>

    <p>"Light bulb?"</p>

    <p>"My sister-in-law would mind if I stayed there!" Zhou Ziyi looked at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Zhuo Yi burst out laughing on the spot.</p>

    <p>Looking back at Jiugong Liangzi behind Zhuo Yi, she obviously didn't expect Zhou Ziyi to suddenly mention this. She stamped her feet shyly on the spot: "Who is your sister-in-law!"</p>

    <p>Then, he quickly left the living room with a red face.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was extremely happy.</p>

    <p>The more he looked at Zhou Ziyi, the more he liked her.</p>

    <p>This young man has a future!</p>

    <p>Know how to observe words and emotions!</p>

    <p>But there was one thing that Zhuo Yi was a little confused about. So he still asked: "I seem to have never told you. She is your sister-in-law, right? Why do you think so?"</p>

    <p>"Ah? It turns out that's not the case. It seems that I was abrupt...I'm sorry, Brother Zhuo."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi scratched the back of his head in embarrassment: "I'm actually very sensitive to smells. I actually felt it as soon as you walked in. The shampoo and body wash you use all have the same smell. That means you guys Two people living together."</p>

    <p>"Then we live together. Maybe she is my sister, right?" Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"No! It can't be my sister's! The way my sister-in-law looks at Brother Zhuo is obviously different... How can a sister be jealous?" Zhou Ziyi whispered.</p>

    <p>"Do you think she's jealous?"</p>

    <p>"Kind of..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi nodded: "But... is she my sister-in-law..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi rubbed Zhou Ziyi's head. He smiled coldly and said, "Don't worry. It will be over soon. And your first priority now is to go back with me to plant legs."</p>

    <p>"But..."</p>

    <p>"There is nothing good about it. There is no road in this world. When you have legs, you have a road. And when you have a road, you have legs. Only then can you widen the road."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The logic of these words was so strong that Zhou Ziyi could not refute it.</p>
