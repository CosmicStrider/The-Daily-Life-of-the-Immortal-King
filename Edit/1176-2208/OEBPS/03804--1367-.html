  <h1>Chapter 1367 Aohai's upgrade path</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk's rich life experience is amazing.</p>

    <p>He has been an emperor, a beggar, a demon saint, and even played various female roles...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked by this. She felt that maybe the monk had experienced all the professions in the world.</p>

    <p>Nearly 4,000 reincarnation experiences. I can play with flowers!</p>

    <p>I can only say that Jin Deng-senpai is worthy of being Jin Deng-senpai... he is worthy of being a representative figure that has been around for a long time!</p>

    <p>The second generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue led the way. Sun Rong followed closely behind them.</p>

    <p>She walked slowly on the soft red carpet of Demon Saint Palace. Halfway there, a question suddenly arose in her heart: "Senior Jin Deng, I have a question..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, it doesn't hurt to have more." The monk smiled politely.</p>

    <p>"Since Senior Jin Deng has experienced so many professions, he has never thought about becoming a monk?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"The journey of reincarnation is a very miraculous path. No matter how reincarnated, the poor monk's final destiny is to become a monk. This is inevitable. It is through the experience of experiencing new professions countless times and finally becoming a monk that the poor monk realizes life, The Buddhist truth suddenly realized..."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said. There was a profound meaning in his words: "Maybe if I say this, Miss Sun will feel pale and powerless. But if Miss Sun has the opportunity to experience reincarnation, she may be able to understand it."</p>

    <p>These words made Sun Rong think.</p>

    <p>After chewing carefully, the girl raised her head again. The look in her eyes was more serious than ever before: "Senior, can you speak more clearly?"</p>

    <p>The monk squinted his eyes slightly. His brain was translating the theories he had filled with scriptures. He tried his best to explain his theories in a vernacular that was easy for ordinary people to understand.</p>

    <p>This process is actually not long.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Sun Rong heard Jin Deng say again: "Perhaps in this world, except for Ling Zhenren who cannot see his own destiny, everyone's destiny is destined and they can change their destiny. That would be going against nature."</p>

    <p>"You see... a poor monk has been reincarnated for thousands of lives. He can't escape his fate as a monk."</p>

    <p>"It's like that groundhog. No matter how hard he struggles, he can't escape his fate of being like a groundhog."</p>

    <p>"It's like Bai Zhe. No matter how many times he is resurrected or what new posture he adopts, he will still be destroyed by Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>"It's like Ku Xuan. No matter how much it is updated, it can't escape its short fate."</p>

    <p>"People can enter reincarnation, but they cannot escape their ultimate fate."</p>

    <p>"A person's persistence in love can also transcend reincarnation. Although the time is very long... but if you endure it, there will always be an end."</p>

    <p>Having said this, the monk glanced at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>He felt that what he hinted at was already obvious.</p>

    <p>But the girl's expression didn't seem to change much.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Sun Ying'er suddenly screamed in surprise. She was almost crying. The second-generation demon saint and Shen Wuyue who were leading the way turned around in shock.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Monk! Are you lying?"</p>

    <p>The monk was puzzled: "I'm a poor monk. How can you deceive me?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er cried even more sadly: "Uuuuu You said you can't escape the fate of reincarnation. Does that mean that I will have to be banged by that perverted ball of Wang Ying in my next life! I am so miserable!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There is a profound meaning in the monk's words. With the girl's intelligence, she can naturally feel it.</p>

    <p>When she saw how Sun Ying'er was moaning and complaining, she felt a little envious in her heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's initiative is far beyond Wang Ling's reach...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Remembered that her master Liu Qingyi complained to her before. People named Wang are all idiots.</p>

    <p>As a result, not long after he said these words, Wang Zhen showed his hand.</p>

    <p>And now, according to the situation of Wang Ying and Sun Ying'er, their shadows are almost together again. But there is no movement at all from them!</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling. He is indeed a fighter among trees!</p>

    <p>"Original Demon Saint. The upgraded altar is just ahead."</p>

    <p>Unknowingly, Sun Rong found that he had been led into the inner palace of the Demon Saint Palace.</p>

    <p>The upgraded altar is arranged here. It is surrounded by twelve simple stone pillars forming a circle. Above it is an umbrella-shaped spire. It looks a bit like a pavilion from a distance. But it is full of mysterious simplicity and ritual feeling.</p>

    <p>Beside the altar, the second-generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue set up an additional demon world upgrade guidance device.</p>

    <p>I plan to take advantage of the opportunity to upgrade the sword spirit. By the way, it will also benefit the demon world.</p>

    <p>"This upgraded array is supported by twelve ancient sword king pillars. It was all arranged by the original Demon Saint. Underground is the upgraded array. I have carefully proofread all the array patterns. They are foolproof. As for the top, ..." At this time, Shen Wuyue looked above the altar.</p>

    <p>The girl next to her followed Shen Wuyue's gaze.</p>

    <p>She saw a crescent-shaped blade that glowed blue hanging from the top of the spire. The blade was engraved with ancient characters. It was very grand and complicated.</p>

    <p>"At this time, the Soul-Severing Blade must be supported by twelve ancient Sword King pillars at the same time before it can be set up."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue explained: "To become a powerful sword spirit, you must break and then stand up. Miss Sun's Aohai can become a super sword spirit after this cut, greatly expanding its own sword spirit space. Finally, through splitting Formula. The ability to achieve infinite sword spirit." He explained. At the same time, he was also amazed at the monk's generosity and Sun Rong's blessing.</p>

    <p>This girl's appearance is too big...</p>

    <p>He actually allowed the monk to take out all the treasures he had packed at the bottom of the box and use them.</p>

    <p>During the upgrade process, the twelve ancient sword king pillars will burst out with powerful energy, attracting the infusion of the power of chaos in the universe, thus causing the Soul-Severing Blade to fall.</p>

    <p>Because the power of chaos is too strong, the ancient sword king pillar will collapse the moment it falls! And the soul-slaying blade will also directly collapse after completing its final mission of cutting down...</p>

    <p>This upgraded altar. Everything is disposable!</p>

    <p>It will be destroyed after upgrading!</p>

    <p>But each of the components was collected by the monk using his nearly 4,000 reincarnation experiences and painstaking efforts.</p>

    <p>Just these twelve ancient sword king pillars and this soul-cutting blade are not priceless treasures that can be measured by money by cultivators in this world.</p>

    <p>They come from the same place as Jingke... a place called: Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue had only heard about it from rumors.</p>

    <p>That place is a hell from which there is no return.</p>

    <p>Anything that comes close will be shattered in an instant.</p>

    <p>"The altar is well decorated."</p>

    <p>After checking the structure of the altar, the monk nodded with satisfaction: "Now, the last step is left."</p>

    <p>Then, he took out the "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube" from the universe in his sleeves.</p>

    <p>Once this thing comes out, there will be no sound in the world! The second generation of demon saints. Parents raised them in vain!</p>

    <p>He and Shen Wuyue were both frightened.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that the monk even had such a sacred object!</p>

    <p>"Original Demon Saint... Could this be..."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>"Sir, can you even get your hands on this?"</p>

    <p>"It's not mine. I don't have the ability." The monk smiled and said, "This is what Ling Zhenren gave me. It is used to complete this upgrade."</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be a token of love!" Shen Wuyue suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>The Demon Saint echoed: "Damn it! The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube should be used as a token of love! It is indeed Ling Zhenren! This thing is worth trillions of times more than a diamond ring! It's so happy to be Ling Zhenren's girlfriend. If it were me... I Just get married!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong The steam came out of his ears again.</p>
