  <h1>Chapter 1546 Sun Island Gray Cult Branch</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede was the first to hear about Wang Ling's composition. It was also the first time that he knew that there was such a fan club on earth with literature lovers as its core members.</p>

    <p>Becoming a religious believer... seems a bit magical to Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>After all, isn't this magical thing like a fan club something only idol stars can have?</p>

    <p>He thought of the situation when a female idol in the otaku circle held a concert.</p>

    <p>Those fanatical otaku fans wear bandages on their heads, wear T-shirts and big pants with their idol's name printed on them, and wave their light sticks in unison to the rhythm of their idol's singing.</p>

    <p>While waving, he made a cheering sound of "hum hum ha ha" from his mouth.</p>

    <p>Will he also wave light sticks for Houlang Sang?</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede couldn't help but feel frightened when he thought of this.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of a normal male thinking, it is really unimaginable for him.</p>

    <p>And since it is a literary support club.</p>

    <p>It's unlikely that he's singing... Could it be that he's reciting poetry and waving light sticks at the same time?</p>

    <p>"I think Ohno-san may be thinking a little too much. In fact, Gray Cult is more normal than any fan club... it's just an ordinary literary exchange."</p>

    <p>Jisaki seemed to know what Ohno Dankaede was thinking. He wiped his sweat and said, "In addition, I checked Ohno-san's academic performance. Your ranking is also among the best in our high school."</p>

    <p>In fact, at Jiudaohe High School, not even the students in Class S are proficient in all courses.</p>

    <p>As long as you are proficient in one or two subjects, you can also enter the S-level sequence with super high learning points and reward points.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede is an excellent student in Sword class.</p>

    <p>His performance in Chinese language classes was also among the best.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, there are two main factors for learning the ultimate subject. One is talent. The other is interest.</p>

    <p>Of course hard work is also important.</p>

    <p>But some things can't be accomplished just by working hard...</p>

    <p>For example, Ku Xuan is a big pigeon.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect to work hard to write 20,000 words, and update every day.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that I can't do it.</p>

    <p>"As long as I join the religion, can I get closer to Houlang Sang?"</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede's eyes were still a little suspicious.</p>

    <p>Jisaki answered earnestly.</p>

    <p>"Now I am the director of the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch of Sun Island. As long as Ohno Dankaede performs well before Houlang Sang and others leave the island, the position of deputy director can be given to you."</p>

    <p>"The deputy minister actually has the opportunity to communicate with Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>"Although it was an online question, at that time, Ohno Dankaede wanted to ask something. Are you still afraid that Houlang Sang won't tell you?"</p>

    <p>This sounds very tempting, but in fact it is still half-cheating and half-coaxing.</p>

    <p>Where does Wang Ling have so much free time to answer these "fans?"</p>

    <p>So-called networking opportunities.</p>

    <p>In fact, the real communication partner is not Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Instead... Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Anyway, through the screen. Who can know who you are chatting with...</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as a means to help the support club grow.</p>

    <p>Of course. Regarding what Ohno Dankaede wants to learn and understand. Sun Rong is also preparing over there.</p>

    <p>Isn't it just gambling...</p>

    <p>Just learn and that's it.</p>

    <p>As for the immediate future.</p>

    <p>After realizing that the membership would indeed deepen the bond with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede was really touched inside: "So what do I need to do after joining the Church. What do I have to do?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it's to expand our Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch. To bring in more Houlang Sang fans. Of course. There's still the literature test. I can use the student union system to check the cultural subject results. I won't consider anything below an "A" grade for now."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede nodded.</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Jisaki and said seriously: "Okay! I have decided! Join the religion!"</p>

    <p>"Smart choice." Jisaki nodded and smiled.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After agreeing to join the religion, Ohno Dankaede had no news of returning to the dormitory.</p>

    <p>Because he joined Gray Cult, it heralded that he had new hope. The previous depression in the meeting room of the Purple Maple Club was instantly gone.</p>

    <p>Jisaki brought Ohno Dankaede to the student union office.</p>

    <p>He saw Ma Jiao counting relevant data on the computer with a serious look on her face.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Ohno Dankaede feels that Vice President Ma Jiao of the Student Union seems to be a little different from before.</p>

    <p>I feel that Rokume Akahoko-san is a lot more approachable?</p>

    <p>To be honest, Ohno Dankaede was quite impressed by Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he felt that every time he saw Vice Chairman Ma Jiao, he could not help but feel a sinister wind blowing around him.</p>

    <p>It seems as if there is some kind of ghost staring at me...</p>

    <p>But now, this feeling has completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>All of this was actually thanks to Sun Rong's rescue in the haunted house.</p>

    <p>"Ma Jiao. Register Ohno Dankaede. He has agreed to join the teaching." As soon as he entered the office, Jisaki carefully closed the door quickly and reported the situation to Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Ma Jiao quickly typed on the keyboard.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede discovered that there were actually many members joining the screen on the screen in front of him.</p>

    <p>He also saw many familiar names among them...</p>

    <p>"Noko Ohira?" Ohno Dankaede blinked, "I thought this was an autistic girl? Everyone at school who knew her said she was weird."</p>

    <p>"There's something wrong with Noko Ohira-san's emotions."</p>

    <p>Jisaki said: "It is said that she was taught by Houlang Sang from a dream..."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede: "..."</p>

    <p>Why does he sound more and more evil the more he listens?</p>

    <p>"We looked at her previous results in cultural classes and judged that she was qualified to teach. Unexpectedly, she agreed as soon as we asked."</p>

    <p>Jisaki scratched his head and smiled.</p>

    <p>In fact, there are quite a few people like "Noko Ohira" who have good grades in cultural courses and directly agree to it after being asked in private by their student council.</p>

    <p>These people are without exception.</p>

    <p>All of them are victims who have been rescued by Wang Ling before. They are all victims of Jiugong Xinghui's previous cooperating with the hair demon to forcefully transform into ghosts.</p>

    <p>Most of them don't remember what happened.</p>

    <p>In the dream, what did the boy talking to them look like? What did he say...</p>

    <p>All have been forgotten.</p>

    <p>There is only a vague outline left in my mind, a warmth that seems to never go away. And... the name Houlang.</p>

    <p>They also don't remember what "Houlang" actually means.</p>

    <p>Just feel the word. There is a sense of intimacy.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the reasons why Wang Ling's pseudonym "Wang Houlang" won the support of so many students from Jiudaohe High School after it topped the high school sword rankings.</p>

    <p>Many of these students are students from Class S and below.</p>

    <p>The proportion of students in Class C and Class B is higher. There are also a small number of Class A students.</p>

    <p>Today, the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch is officially established under the coordination of Jisaki, Wang Ming and Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao just programmed an invitation program to automatically select suitable candidates and send them out. Unexpectedly, these invitations received responses from many people.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede glanced at the numbers next to the EXCEL list.</p>

    <p>Counting him, 56 people have actually agreed to join the church...</p>

    <p>This scale is higher than the number of members of some Rainbow Seven Gangs!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is...</p>

    <p>Jisaki said this is the first day that the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch was established!</p>

    <p>So many people agreed to apply on the first day... So from now on, isn't the entire Jiudaohe going to be wrapped up by Gray Cult?</p>

    <p>Is this the great man's strategy of "surrounding the city from the countryside?"</p>

    <p>Of course. The most incredible thing about Ohno Dankaede is.</p>

    <p>This Gray Cult support club is the support club of Houlang Sang! And the branch director is the current president of the student union of Jiudaohe!</p>

    <p>Gathering the local strength of Sun Island Jiudaohe to support a student who came all the way from abroad and is only staying for a few days... This sounds outrageous!</p>

    <p>But having said that.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede The moment I saw the list, I still felt a sense of pride in my heart.</p>

    <p>This kind of pride cannot be felt in any of the Rainbow Seven Gangs.</p>

    <p>It is indeed Houlang Sang!</p>

    <p>The real god immortal!</p>

    <p>It's only been a few days...</p>

    <p>You can actually gain the attention and support of so many people with your charisma!</p>

    <p>He is indeed the man he likes!</p>

    <p>"The registration has been completed. Ohno Dankaede." At this time, Ma Jiao's words interrupted his thoughts.</p>

    <p>"So fast?"</p>

    <p>"Just copy and paste personal information. No trouble."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao said: "Did you also see the pamphlet on my desk? This is the Gray Cult program that was temporarily printed. Please be careful to recite it. Otherwise, it will be bad if you are considered a mole."</p>

    <p>"Is there still a program?" Ohno Dankaede was stunned.</p>

    <p>He opened the gray-covered booklet.</p>

    <p>The so-called Gray Cult program is not a program in the true sense.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was the essay called {Stand-in} that Crispy Noodles Dao Lord wrote for Wang Ling at the Jiulong Mountain Physical Arts Conference...</p>

    <p>The famous phrase "a grain of ash in the times" comes from there.</p>

    <p>But just reciting this sentence is obviously not enough to become a true fan.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Sun Rong has already established the most basic conditions for admission.</p>

    <p>That is "full text recitation."</p>

    <p>And every month, the heads of each major branch will conduct regular spot checks. If you can't memorize it, the door will be cleared directly...</p>

    <p>"There are only so many of us on the first day. Can I still take the position of vice president?" Ohno Dankaede looked at the list with some doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>Asking him to carry something on his back is not a difficult task.</p>

    <p>It's just that he is worried about whether the promise Jisaki made to him before can be fulfilled.</p>

    <p>"A branch can have up to two deputy ministers. Ohno Dankaede is a student in District S. Currently, apart from Ma Jiao and I, you are the third student to join Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>Jisaki said: "Since I promised Mr. Ohno to be the deputy minister, of course I will not break my promise. But Mr. Ohno must also cooperate and do some work. Otherwise, I'm afraid it will be difficult to convince the public."</p>

    <p>"I understand this." Ohno Dankaede said: "So. What do you need me to do?"</p>

    <p>"Help us attract more students from District S."</p>

    <p>Jisaki said: "My classmate Ma Jiao and I are members of the student union. There is a certain degree of specialness. It's hard to talk to us over in District S."</p>

    <p>"S District... Those people are indeed stubborn. When I came out of the Purple Maple Society, those people from the Rainbow Seven Gang were planning to make plans to embarrass Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>"What specific plan is it?"</p>

    <p>"I have made it clear that I will not get involved. So they have excluded me..."</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's a pity. Otherwise you could be an undercover agent. Do you know that gin in Conan? It seems like there are undercover agents around you."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In other words, do we have any other way to develop undercover agents in each gang within the Rainbow Seven Gang?"</p>

    <p>"I do have a few brothers with whom I have a good relationship. You can ask them."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede frowned: "But whether they all agree or not. I don't know."</p>

    <p>"Just try your best."</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>It is certainly important to win over students from District S.</p>

    <p>On the other side, as young people in the new era of cultivation. In addition, the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch also has computer experts like Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>As the president, Jisaki has a lot of room for leadership.</p>

    <p>The next step. Of course, what he has to do is to expand the scale. And then accumulate the popularity of Gray Cult on the Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he asked Ma Jiao to register a "Jiudaohe Gray Cult Branch" account on Station B.</p>

    <p>I plan to release some interesting short videos in the future to gain popularity for Gray Cult on the Internet.</p>

    <p>"I forgot to mention Ohno-san." At this time, Jisaki said suddenly.</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"Congratulations on joining the religion!" He stretched out his hand and held it tightly with Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>"I'll do my best, Minister!"</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede nodded.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was extremely serious.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the dormitory. Wang Ling was sitting cross-legged on the floor with no clothes on.</p>

    <p>Although I have tried my best to preserve my physical strength in today's battle, the one-time sealing of the talisman actually still consumed a lot of energy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming cannot make more Talisman in a short time.</p>

    <p>You can only use your own technical means to patch those disposable Talismans that have collapsed but are not too damaged.</p>

    <p>Full repair is impossible.</p>

    <p>Some one-time Talisman collapse is so complete that there is no room for rescue.</p>

    <p>Even if the others are rescued, the effect will not be as good as before.</p>

    <p>Take durability as an example.</p>

    <p>When a brand new disposable Talisman comes out. If the durability is 100.</p>

    <p>Now it's broken and rescued. Wang Ming can probably only save 1-5 points of durability.</p>

    <p>No matter how small a mosquito's legs are, they are still meat. In this situation, it is better than nothing.</p>

    <p>And now, these are the ones that have been rescued.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally had more than ninety talismans. After today's selection, 81 were left.</p>

    <p>If you don't count the rescued ones, there are less than 70 left.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming gently patted Wang Ling on the back.</p>

    <p>He had to put the rescued disposable Talisman on Wang Ling one by one as if applying plaster.</p>

    <p>But he didn't dare to use too much force on his hands.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I'm afraid of being slapped and breaking my bones...</p>

    <p>"You kid. Why is your skin whiter than Yinzi's?" Wang Ming said with a smile as he helped Wang Ling reattach the charm.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was silent.</p>

    <p>I manually darkened my skin tone a bit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at the rapidly darkening skin color. The corner of his mouth twitched: "It's just normal... it doesn't have to be as dark as the African chiefs..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah." After a moment of skinning, Wang Ling quickly adjusted his skin color back.</p>

    <p>Under the quiet night, the two brothers rarely talked.</p>

    <p>"That black stone. I haven't reached the research stage yet. It will take some time to analyze the box outside. But it shouldn't be too difficult." Wang Ming clicked his tongue: "It's a pity that Yinzi doesn't understand this. I think it's best. I have an assistant."</p>

    <p>Actually mentioned here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>However, person Number 1 vaguely emerged.</p>

    <p>This person is no one else.</p>

    <p>It is the civilian scientist who was recruited by Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong respectively before: Shou Chong...</p>
