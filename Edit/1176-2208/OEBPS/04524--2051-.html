  <h1>Chapter 2051 The future of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: It took Sun Ru longer than Immortal Toya to digest it and come back to her senses. She was still in a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>Because everything she just saw was too shocking. It was far beyond what she could understand with her current level of cultivation.</p>

    <p>The will of the universe, the miracle of the universe...</p>

    <p>This is also the first vocabulary that Sun Ru knows. This may be something that she will never be able to touch even if she spends the rest of her life.</p>

    <p>"What about the decadent years?" Sun Ru asked after regaining consciousness.</p>

    <p>"He was re-sealed back to the ancient tripod by Ling Zhenren. And because he was forcibly severed from the contract with the other shore tree, one of the miracles of the universe, his whole soul was damaged. In addition, he suffered internal and external injuries on his body. There is no time of a hundred thousand years. It's impossible to return to the original state." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>This is just Immortal Toya's conservative estimate as an alchemist. The internal and external injuries on the body are not bad. The contract of the cosmic miracle derived from the will of the universe was forcibly severed. This damage to the soul is too great.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that at this time, Xianfeng Nian's eyes were still red. He was twitching like a maggot in the ancient cauldron as if he was delirious.</p>

    <p>How long it will take to return to normal consciousness in such a state is anyone's guess.</p>

    <p>But now, the only person who can save him is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Xiufengnian was a proud and complacent bastard, he still had some use for himself. This was the reason why Wang Ying did not kill him in the end.</p>

    <p>But actually Wang Ling still regrets letting Wang Ying take action.</p>

    <p>This guy never strikes lightly. Look at how he beat this kid. Even his mother can't recognize him...</p>

    <p>He sighed silently. Wang Ling stood on his tiptoes slightly. His body floated directly into the air. He once again used the method of shrinking the ground to an inch, directly bypassing the coordinates of the ancient tripod of the Immortal Palace and reaching the back of the palace.</p>

    <p>A huge mirror with seven colors of light came into Wang Ling's eyes. This mirror was very large. It directly covered the wall behind the entire immortal hall. It reminded Wang Ling of the time when he entered the mirror world. experience.</p>

    <p>He tried to put his hand in. The huge mirror immediately emitted seven-color lotus flowers. A warm spiritual power enveloped his hand, and it accepted him directly.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said that only the head of the Sun family can successfully pass through this mirror and enter the fifth map of the Sun family's ancestral land, "Thousands of Thunder Ponds."</p>

    <p>If it were not the head of the Sun family but an outsider who broke in, this mirror would directly lead people into the tomb of Zhenshan Knight.</p>

    <p>That was the main gathering point for the entire Sun family's ancestral land, Zhenshan Knights. Breaking into the Zhenshan Knights' tomb would inevitably lead to an earth-shattering battle.</p>

    <p>"I wonder if the head of the family knows the origin of the Immortal Mirror?" At this time, Sun Ru's voice sounded again. According to the head of the "Sun Ling" family, because he had only succeeded as the head of the Sun family not long ago, he didn't know much about the situation of the Sun family's ancestral land. It was too familiar. Therefore, Sun Ru acted as an interpreter almost subconsciously.</p>

    <p>"Is there any way to forget the immortal mirror?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"As long as you stand in front of this mirror and throw away distracting thoughts, you can see your future through this mirror." Sun Ru replied.</p>

    <p>"Really effective?"</p>

    <p>"You are the descendant of Laojun. You must have heard of this legend, right? This mirror is polished with meteorites from outer space. And it is said that the stronger the realm, the longer the person can see in the future. The clearer the picture."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said: "I also saw it before I was buried. But it only lasted for three seconds. I saw a dark scene with no sunlight. There were sounds of fighting all around. But I seemed to be asleep."</p>

    <p>"So what Senior Sun Ru saw was..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. I saw myself buried underground."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>I have to say. This aroused the curiosity of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Is there really a magic weapon in this world that can see one's own future?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling At that moment, he almost completely believed in Sun Ru's evil deeds.</p>

    <p>Anyone who knows him knows that he is a person. Although he is usually not willing to meddle in other people's business, sometimes he is just curious.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling also discovered it. The older you get...the more curious you become...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is quite interested in his future.</p>

    <p>After all, he tried all his means and could not see his own future.</p>

    <p>Previously, he even used King's Eyes to see his future. It was a picture of nothingness and confusion. Empty. Nothing.</p>

    <p>Later Wang Ling understood. This was not a problem of his lack of ability. It was an explanation based on reasonable logic.</p>

    <p>After all, no matter how strong a person is, he cannot pull himself up by his own hair.</p>

    <p>So when I heard that this "immortal mirror" can see a person's future, Wang Ling inevitably had some fluctuations in my heart.</p>

    <p>He took his hand away from the mirror. He stood quietly in front of the immortal mirror and slowly closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>When he opened his eyes again, he saw that the scene in the mirror in front of him suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a familiar sound of music sounded directly in my ears.</p>

    <p>It seemed like a wedding march...</p>

    <p>As the wedding march played, he saw a woman wearing a white wedding dress...</p>

    <p>This scene should have been very clear.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. Wang Ling now has 600Â° myopia. I couldn't see clearly what this woman's face looked like.</p>

    <p>Then there was nothing more. The scene Wang Ling saw came to an abrupt end. As the BGM suddenly stopped, he also came back to his senses from this short future scene.</p>

    <p>"How is it? What did Ling Zhenren see?" Immortal Toya asked curiously.</p>

    <p>Only the observer can see the picture of the future. Even if other people are watching at the same time, the scene they can see is only their own future.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling is also confused about his future.</p>

    <p>He could only recall the blurry face of the woman in the wedding dress. And the wedding BGM that now sounded extremely abrupt...</p>

    <p>What are these?</p>

    <p>It's impossible for him to get married...</p>

    <p>Could it be that he attended Ah Nuan girl's wedding?</p>

    <p>But how old is this girl now?</p>

    <p>How many years into the future is this future?</p>

    <p>In short. All this seems quite inexplicable to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, something unexpected happened to everyone here.</p>

    <p>I saw this huge immortal mirror in front of me. Actually, after Wang Ling's inspection, a crack appeared directly in the center of the mirror.</p>

    <p>However, this crack cracked quickly like an eggshell. It spread rapidly in all directions like spider legs.</p>

    <p>Forget the immortal mirror...</p>

    <p>It actually broke into pieces!</p>

    <p>And it was completely broken!</p>

    <p>The cracks on the entire mirror surface continued to overlap. Finally, it turned into wisps of smoke and dissipated directly in front of the face!</p>

    <p>It just gave him a glimpse of his future. The key is still the blurry picture. Will this lead to a direct collapse...</p>
