  <h1>Chapter 2154 Mr. Canghu's business plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website:. !</p>

    <p>Xiongwu retreated.</p>

    <p>With this move, Xiongwu's own face was completely wiped out. The entire Four Elephant Crowd suddenly became the target of public criticism. Due to the original Four Elephant Crowd's important role in the dungeon, many players had to fight with the Four Elephant Crowd in order to clear the dungeon. Cooperation. Therefore, when dealing with the behavior of some bullying newcomers in Sixiang Community, they dare not speak up but dare to express anger.</p>

    <p>Now in this battle, Xiongwu was defeated at the hands of an "NPC" from Fuyun Town. This made players all over the world start to get excited.</p>

    <p>For a time, many people's voices of condemnation began to come out continuously. When one person stood up and challenged Xiong Wu's authority, there would be a steady stream of successors.</p>

    <p>It is also thanks to Xiongwu. This makes many new players feel that they have found a new haven of refuge - Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>Many new players don't think that when they encounter a little trouble being chased by mobs, this general will take the initiative to protect themselves. But at least if they suffer injustice!</p>

    <p>For example, when someone is bullied due to a grade difference.</p>

    <p>Then the general of Fuyun Town will definitely not sit idly by and ignore it, right?</p>

    <p>The general of Fuyun Town is only level 1!</p>

    <p>Isn't this just plain telling the players. The real role of this NPC general is to protect high-level players from bullying new players.</p>

    <p>After the battle with Xiongwu, Wang Ling returned to the general's mansion and continued to silently recite the mantra of "God descends to earth" to increase blood volume.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also glanced at everyone's conclusions.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the player's brainstorming ability is really strong. But whether he can make a move or not. It really depends on the timing.</p>

    <p>Not every fight. He will do it.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling vaguely felt that this battle was over. Sun Rong doubted himself even more.</p>

    <p>And some brave and careful players began to search for system update information to confirm whether he was a real player or an NPC.</p>

    <p>After all, such a bug-level NPC appears in a novice village. This is considered a big change. It is impossible not to mention it completely in the system update announcement.</p>

    <p>Some players feel that they may have omitted it when watching it before. Maybe they missed some important details.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling ignored these players' suspicions.</p>

    <p>Because it's normal.</p>

    <p>You can't change everyone's thinking to yours. It's exactly the same as yours.</p>

    <p>In summary, there are three parties of players discussing his identity.</p>

    <p>Some people think he is a real NPC.</p>

    <p>Some people think that he is pretending to be a real player. But these people only account for a very small part. Because everyone would rather believe that this is an NPC... After all, if it is a real player, it would be a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>The third group of people's ideas are even more novel. They think Wang Ling is a hidden NPC.</p>

    <p>What is a hidden NPC?</p>

    <p>This type of NPC generally does not appear in public view, but will take action when necessary. But in fact, the game administrator is behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>And this perfectly explains why Wang Ling has so many god-level skills.</p>

    <p>After all, to GM, no matter how precious and rare these things are, they are just a bunch of data.</p>

    <p>So what will happen next when things develop?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself is extremely curious.</p>

    <p>He sat cross-legged in the general's mansion. Looking at his rising blood bar, he still felt calm in his heart.</p>

    <p>He has completed a small target amount of health.</p>

    <p>The ultimate goal is to stack up to 10 small goals.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling still needs time.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong and Lao Huang were busy at the Wolong Recruitment Office. Especially after the battle with Xiongwu, new players continued to apply to join. Suddenly, the entire Fuyun Town became famous.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, the Wolong Agreement is an agreement for joint development. Joining Fuyun Town means that in the future you can obtain corresponding city resources that match the city's contribution.</p>

    <p>It is considered an investment.</p>

    <p>And once you join, it also means that Wolong people will not be able to voluntarily withdraw from Wolong recruitment in the next 30 days. They need to apply and get the consent of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, this is really similar to recruiting employees.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lao Huang are now equivalent to HR. Wang Ling also didn't expect that young people who love to show off so much these days would actually have a day to get a job.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that modern young people are actually quite motivated. As long as the treatment you give can perfectly match, why worry about others not working hard and happily?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the continuous news from Fuyun Town also made Mr. Canghu, who was not far away, feel itchy. He had wanted to take a look for a long time. He had always had such an obsession in his heart.</p>

    <p>But now Mr. Canghu feels that it is not the right time. At the beginning of the game, in the newcomer stage, some people come for level, and some come for experience. And Mr. Canghu's goal is also very clear. He just wants to accumulate wealth. Go.</p>

    <p>It sounds a bit vulgar, but Mr. Canghu feels that for people like him who are not very good at playing games, making money and hiring someone to play with them is the only way out.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his knowledge is profound enough.</p>

    <p>Under the cover of a hired fleet, Mr. Canghu successfully refined the spiritual mushrooms he collected into pills in the wild, and took them to nearby towns for sale.</p>

    <p>Good hemostatic medicine is a necessity in the eyes of any player. It is needed for survival in the wild and for dungeons. However, hemostatic medicine is expensive. Those specialized in town pharmacies are not cheap. One pill costs more than twenty taels of silver. This For many players, it is simply adding insult to injury.</p>

    <p>As for Mr. Canghu, he just set up his stall next to the drugstore. He sells elixirs with the same effect. The price is only 50% of what the drugstore sells.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that drugs in pharmacies cannot be taken continuously. The second treatment effect will be reduced by half.</p>

    <p>Many players who passed by Mr. Canghu's booth were surprised to find that the medicines in Mr. Canghu's booth did not have this restriction!</p>

    <p>"Brother, did you make the medicine yourself?"</p>

    <p>Players passing by were shocked: "How many do you have on you?"</p>

    <p>"There are only 200 pills available at the moment."</p>

    <p>"Twelve a piece. I cover them all!"</p>

    <p>The player said generously.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Canghu is not such a stupid person.</p>

    <p>He sells medicine, but does not work for others. In addition to selling his own elixirs, he also has to strictly control market circulation.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a large number of cheap and good medicines will appear in the hands of one person. Who knows if this person will increase the price and sell it elsewhere?</p>

    <p>So, Mr. Canghu smiled slightly and raised two fingers mysteriously: "Limited to 2 pieces per person."</p>

    <p>That's right...</p>

    <p>Although hunger marketing seems shameless to Mr. Canghu., sometimes this trick can work wonders.</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, the corner of the player's mouth in front of him twitched. He stared at Mr. Canghu's booth and felt itchy in his heart. He really wanted to take them all.</p>

    <p>But there was a purchase restriction. In the end, I only paid for two pills.</p>

    <p>As Mr. Canghu thought, good and cheap medicines can always be sold without any worries.</p>

    <p>The supply of these third-level blood-restoring wild elixirs that he refined under wild conditions was almost in short supply. They directly brought him 2,000 taels of silver.</p>

    <p>The net income was more than 1,980 taels.</p>

    <p>Then, as long as he continues to repeat the operation, hire better teams or players, go deep into dangerous areas, collect better spiritual plants and refine higher-level elixirs.</p>

    <p>Then soon, he might be able to buy the pharmacy in front of him.</p>
