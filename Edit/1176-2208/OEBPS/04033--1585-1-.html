  <h1>Chapter 1585 Clear the field with one eye</h1>

  <div>

    <p>These mysterious civilizations that were first created in the universe seem to symbolize the depth and boundless terror of the universe itself.</p>

    <p>They just stood there and didn't move, which gave people a sense of great pressure and fear.</p>

    <p>This kind of fear is completely from the spiritual level. Especially when it goes beyond the cognition of an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>For example, before Wang Ling appeared, Leng Ming was shocked by this mysterious and unknown force.</p>

    <p>It's as if it can penetrate directly into the depths of the soul.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Ling appeared that Leng Ming's gradually losing sanity was forcibly pulled back.</p>

    <p>The mental pressure brought by Old Dominator can be said to be natural. This is an innate ability of them as the creators of the early civilization of the universe.</p>

    <p>If you stay in the same space with these gods of the old age for too long, it will easily lead to mental breakdown. And once this breakdown reaches an extreme value, you will completely lose your mind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look at the "Eternals" summoned by the resurrecting Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>There are more than eighty of them.</p>

    <p>These immortal beings are covered with a holy shimmering coat and shrouded in golden holy light. They don't seem to have a trace of evil. They are just like the gods in the old universe. They exude an indescribable majesty.</p>

    <p>The Eternals moved their countless tentacles forward slowly. Wang Ling's face remained calm. However, Wang Nuan looked strongly uneasy.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Leng Ming reincarnated into his grass form and stood on Ah Nuan girl's head. It was like an amulet. It exuded a green body-protecting sword film.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling is here, the scene in front of him also makes Leng Ming feel uneasy.</p>

    <p>He chose to protect Wang Nuan as double insurance. In case of a fight, he won't be able to take care of Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>This small gesture is extremely heart-warming.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling more certain of his original decision to choose Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stopped for a moment on the top of this ancient mountain.</p>

    <p>He stared at these eternal beings squirming towards him. He could indeed feel an increasingly powerful mental pressure. This dark supreme world that was almost collapsing, also accompanied by this group of summoned Old Dominators, reached A strange check and balance.</p>

    <p>Darkness, Holy Light, Chaos, Decay...these intricate forces are intertwined.</p>

    <p>Except for these Old Dominators and Wang Ling's group of people, there are no other living beings in the supreme world at this moment.</p>

    <p>But when Wang Ling stood on the ancient mountain, he could clearly hear the screams of countless crows in front of him. It was like the moans and shouts of a witch, constantly echoing in his ears.</p>

    <p>It's really something remarkable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>After all, in this universe, except for this nightmare, it is rare that anything else can cause him great pressure.</p>

    <p>But the sense of oppression generated by these Old Dominators in front of me is real.</p>

    <p>It's like Wang Ling has never felt pain since he was a child. But now... he finally feels that he has been bitten by a mosquito!</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>In the distance, under the illumination of the holy light, these eternal beings moving slowly forward turned into black shadows. They were layered on top of each other, making it difficult to see the reality clearly.</p>

    <p>There was a buzzing sound. One of the Eternals suddenly appeared in front of Wang Ling and Wang Ling from a long distance at an extremely fast speed.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise. There was a powerful aura of chaos permeating the air. It had a smell of annihilation. It was extremely bright!</p>

    <p>The huge light pillar burst out with high temperature and filled with powerful power. Wang Ling raised his hand to cut off this blazing light of annihilation.</p>

    <p>He just waved his hand lightly, but it had an effect similar to that of parting the sea. The energy that smelled of annihilation dissipated instantly.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, these eternal beings would try to destroy him in such a way.</p>

    <p>This further proves that Fenmu Shen, who is about to resurrect and evolve into his second form, is not an ordinary "Old Dominator."</p>

    <p>Most likely a top being among the Old Dominators. Maybe a powerful Outer God.</p>

    <p>Or maybe it will be the legendary omniscient and omnipotent head of the demon god. Also the so-called core source of chaos?</p>

    <p>Regarding Fenmu Shen's growth. Wang Ling suddenly became a little curious.</p>

    <p>The combat power of these eternal immortals in front of them is not low. Even the Dao God-level family patriarchs in the divine domain are not easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>But these eternal beings are like crazy and use this self-destructive method to try to drag Wang Ling to hell with them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Take a deep breath.</p>

    <p>When the second immortal blew himself up in front of his eyes in this way, he felt that he couldn't wait any longer.</p>

    <p>Because if I keep blowing myself up like this, Wang Ling thinks it will scare Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>In addition to being very strong, these Old Dominators also have a common characteristic: they are ugly.</p>

    <p>His sister had just been born. It would be bad if this left a shadow of childhood.</p>

    <p>In fact, these eternal beings are actually just born after being summoned...</p>

    <p>They don't know that what they face next will also be the shadow of their childhood.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling is standing on the ancient mountain. There is a golden aura flowing around him. The body of a young man who is not very tall exudes a great majesty.</p>

    <p>When the red dragon rotates, the three-petal golden lotus in the pupil blooms. The overwhelming pressure is like a stormy wave, encompassing everything in front of it!</p>

    <p>Everything as far as the eye can see is reduced to ashes!</p>

    <p>No one can withstand the power of Wang Ling. The original kind and kind attitude of those eternal beings covered in golden holy light began to completely reverse. They lost their last dignity. The screams made all living beings tremble.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's pupils released a terrifying beam of destruction.</p>

    <p>The astonishing pupil power seems to have a power that reaches eternity, destroying everything!</p>

    <p>This glance was impeccable. His eyes flashed across the sky, like thunder destroying the world. The summoned Old Dominators fell to their knees on the ground.</p>

    <p>No matter how noble their status was in the past and how powerful they were as legendary gods.</p>

    <p>In front of Wang Ling. They only deserve to kneel like that.</p>

    <p>In an instant, all the Eternals died. They disappeared into their own holy beams and were annihilated into a ball of ashes.</p>

    <p>The moment King's Eyes releases its power.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen, who was evolving, summoned these eternal beings to himself to resist this fatal attack.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not want to let go of Fenmu Shen. He stared at the direction of Fenmu Shen and tried to gather his power again.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen's resistance was stronger than he imagined.</p>

    <p>In this supreme world, countless dark portals open again. An unknown fog is generated from the air. This is a fog that ordinary pupils cannot penetrate. Those who fall into it will be surrounded by darkness.</p>

    <p>Then he lost all reason in an instant.</p>

    <p>A strange creature with huge compound eyes and countless tentacles around its body. It poured out of the portal in groups. It was like a swarm of bees rushing out of the nest. Desperately heading in the direction of Wang Ling Rush away.</p>

    <p>This is another Old Dominator. It's called "Final Hunter."</p>

    <p>Their size is far less than that of the previous "Eternal Ones", but there are many of them. Even though they know they will die, they still blow the fatal charge horn in the direction that Wang Ling can see.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan will definitely be scared...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but feel a little worried.</p>

    <p>He tilted his head slightly and paid close attention to Ah Nuan's expression.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Ah Nuan girl was staring at these mysterious creatures flying towards her at high speed. She was sucking her fingers. She swallowed...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>
