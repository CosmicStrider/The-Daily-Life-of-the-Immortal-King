  <h1>Chapter 1489 The Understanding King of the 9th Palace Family</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It's such a small world...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>Although when Jiugong Liangzi said the keyword "Office of Strategic Deception", he vaguely felt that some acquaintance of his might be involved.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that this acquaintance was actually senior Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a monk who has lived so many reincarnations. He has worked in all professions... Even the production of the Jiugong family's {Ghost Book} is related to him. He is a "full-time master!"</p>

    <p>"It seems like you know this senior?" Jiugong Liangzi blinked and looked at Zhuo Yi. He seemed to be expecting something.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled coldly in his heart.</p>

    <p>This is more than just a relationship...</p>

    <p>Ever since he was "convinced" by Wang Ling, senior Jin Deng has become one of his own. Although he does not appear to be working in the Office of Strategic Deception, he actually works in the Office of Strategic Deception. in the core member group.</p>

    <p>And because he knows that he is Wang Ling's apprentice, Jin Deng actually takes great care of Zhuo Yi. Basically, as long as Zhuo Yi dares to speak, Jin Deng will never refuse his request.</p>

    <p>Of course. Zhuo Yi usually won't ask Jin Deng for help if nothing happens.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that Jin Deng was willing to help him. To a large extent, it was for the sake of his master.</p>

    <p>And for seniors like this, they may not be able to appreciate him even if he returns to his lover's family, so he might end up causing trouble to Master.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>For the sake of Jiugong Liangzi. Zhuo Yi feels bold.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that this can't be called a request. It's just an instruction to help Jiugong Liangzi meet with Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>"I probably know where Senior Jin Deng is. But it's hard to say whether we'll meet or not." Zhuo Yi deliberately let it slip: "Okay. I'll take Liangzi to have a look today."</p>

    <p>"I'll go too! I can send someone else over to keep an eye on it!" Junko said.</p>

    <p>"You can't. You have to stay and watch people."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the female bodyguard: "Monk Jin Deng is not used to being disturbed. If too many people come, he will be unhappy."</p>

    <p>"But..."</p>

    <p>"Just do what Zhuo Yi says. Junko, keeping an eye on the three people, Ah Wei, is your first priority." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"I understand, miss! Do you really have something to do with this Zhuo Yi..." Junko felt like he had discovered a huge secret. He dismissed her so obviously. It was clear that he wanted to live in a world of two. !</p>

    <p>"If you keep talking nonsense, I will deduct all your salary."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed. He snorted: "The reason why I chose you to come here and keep an eye on is because... I can only choose you! Now Ah Wei and the others are under protection. Everyone else thinks they are dead." This is such an important secret. It must be guarded by the person I trust most!"</p>

    <p>"I am Miss. The person you trust most..."</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>The female bodyguard named Junko was helpless. Jiugong Liangzi's words moved her a little. For this reason, she could only follow the order: "I understand. Miss, Junko will not let the miss down."</p>

    <p>Then, she followed Jiugong Liangzi's instructions and went to the front desk to register her identity again.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi glanced at the female bodyguard's temporary ID card and passport from a distance. The names on them were all: Junko Zhongchun.</p>

    <p>From the beginning, Zhuo Yi felt that there was something wrong with this female bodyguard. But I couldn't tell what was wrong.</p>

    <p>After all, he is someone whom Jiugong Liangzi trusts so much. Zhuo Yi actually doesn't want to doubt Junko Zhongchun's loyalty to Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But just to be cautious...</p>

    <p>He decided to find out the details of Junko privately.</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about? Can we leave now?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi looked at Zhuo Yi with anticipation and said.</p>

    <p>"Nothing. I was just thinking about the name Junko Zhongchun." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with the name?"</p>

    <p>"The words "grass" and "heavy" when combined together, don't they mean "dong"? And Miss Junko's mantra seems to be: I understand." Zhuo Yi smiled and said: "So. Miss Junko is the understanding king of your Jiugong family?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corner of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched. He felt as if he had heard a cold joke with a homophone: "Do you think you are funny..."</p>

    <p>"Are you cold? Sorry." Zhuo Yi smiled apologetically.</p>

    <p>"Having this time, I'm afraid I would have found Senior Jin Deng long ago." Jiugong Liangzi sighed.</p>

    <p>"The purpose of why you are so eager to find your predecessors. Do you want to know why the replica {Ghost Book} rioted?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said frankly: "The replica version in my hand has never had any problems before. But after all, that happened yesterday. This thing is like a time bomb in my hand now."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. You'll definitely find it." Zhuo Yi comforted the anxious girl. He calmed down and said, "And are you sure. We'll leave now?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! Of course, the faster, the better!"</p>

    <p>"But haven't we changed our clothes yet?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled and said: "Of course. If you don't mind, of course I won't mind wearing this couple's Hanfu set with my classmate Liangzi."</p>

    <p>"rogue..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed. Then he stepped on Zhuo Yi angrily and ran upstairs to change clothes.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi followed behind. There was a sour feeling on his face.</p>

    <p>This foot makes him feel comfortable...</p>

    <p>If you step on him while wearing black stockings, Zhuo Yi would feel quite interesting.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Liangzi, Zhuo Yi all left, Junko Zhongchun officially took over the task of looking after Ah Wei and the other three.</p>

    <p>The room diagonally opposite the door. She could notice the slightest movement.</p>

    <p>According to the rules of the Witness Protection Program, Ah Wei and the other two were not allowed to leave the room without a special request.</p>

    <p>They were staying in a three-person suite. The signal in the room was blocked. No signal from any communication magic weapon could be transmitted.</p>

    <p>Junko will be responsible for the meals for the three of them. He will deliver the meals at designated times and watch them take away all the trash after they finish eating.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to ensure that Ah Wei and the three of them will not go crazy in the room, the TV in the room can be activated normally. There is also a game console installed. They can play some stand-alone games that do not require online connection to pass the time.</p>

    <p>This was originally a very simple job. It was even a bit boring and tedious. But the advantage is that it is generally relatively leisurely.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Junko Zhongchun should be happy. But she didn't feel relaxed at all.</p>

    <p>Previously, she wanted to go with Jiugong Liangzi to meet Jin Deng. It was also because she had her own little plan...</p>

    <p>At this time, it is absolutely right not to stay in the hotel.</p>

    <p>Because the three of them, Ah Wei, are very important to Miss Liangzi...</p>

    <p>But now she is forced to stay. Even Junko Zhongchun himself doesn't know what will happen next.</p>

    <p>She hugged her knees and sat on the bed. The thoughts in her heart were extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>At this time, the phone vibrated.</p>

    <p>The same "unknown call" as before made Junko Zhongchun's heart instantly lift.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? It seems that you haven't reported the situation for two days in a row..." Although the voice on the other end of the phone has been changed, it can still be heard. This is a person with a rough voice.</p>

    <p>Junko Zhongchun knew who she was talking to. She immediately fell silent. After a long time, he said: "Sorry... I took leave yesterday and went to the hospital... so..."</p>

    <p>"Don't make excuses."</p>

    <p>The person on the other end of the phone didn't bother to listen to the explanation: "Ms. Junko, I hope you can understand your situation and position. Don't play tricks."</p>

    <p>"I know..."</p>

    <p>"Very good. Now, let me ask you...Jiugong Liangzi. Is she still alive?"</p>

    <p>On the other side of the phone, the person sneered in a controlled tone: "Ms. Junko, I hope you can answer truthfully..."</p>
