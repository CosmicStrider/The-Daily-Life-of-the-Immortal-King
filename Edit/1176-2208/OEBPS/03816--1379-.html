  <h1>Chapter 1379 The out-of-control Heavenly Dao star</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that maybe even Sun Ying'er herself didn't think of it. In fact, she has a good impression of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>And she even felt that it was not just Sun Ying'er who felt towards Wang Ying. Wang Ying also felt the same way towards Ying'er.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying is doing to Sun Ying'er now is like a boy in school who can't figure out his feelings pulling the pigtails of the girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>Boys habitually use pranks to attract girls' attention.</p>

    <p>So in a sense, Wang Ying's emotional expression is that of a three year old Shadow. Although he is very proactive, it is obvious that he has not figured out the real position of Sun Ying Er in his mind.</p>

    <p>Of course. The above is just Sun Rong's own understanding.</p>

    <p>Facing what happened between the two shadows. Sun Rong Although I have never seen it with my own eyes, I mostly only heard about it from Sun Ying'er's mouth.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong still feels a bit envious deep in his heart.</p>

    <p>Even though the way Shadow expresses his feelings is a bit childish, it doesn't make sense that it's something that Shadow would eat up!</p>

    <p>Expression is better than no expression at all!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. How long can I wait for you?" Sun Rong smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>While thinking about things, Sun Ying'er's chirping voice was automatically cut off. When Sun Rong came back to her senses, she only heard Sun Ying'er asking her after a period of powerful analysis: "So Rongrong. I think my analysis is correct. Miss Ajuan must have a crush on Wang Ying!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help but laugh. This sounded quite angry. But she didn't know why she could smell... a strong smell of vinegar?</p>

    <p>"Miss Ajuan is a good girl. She can't have such thoughts. You are thinking too much! She must have other things." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong! Why are your elbows turned outwards?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was unhappy: "You can't favor Miss Ajuan just because she is a staunch LingRong Party."</p>

    <p>"What... what LingRong Party?" Sun Rong's face turned red again.</p>

    <p>"You guys! Anyone with a discerning eye knows that almost all the members of the Office of Strategic Deception are now LingRong Party! The whole world is assisting. Of course Miss Ajuan is no exception! Hehe!" Sun Ying'er's eyes revealed a bit of cunning.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was speechless by his own shadow. He held it in for a long time. Finally, he shyly scolded: "Take care of your house, Wang Ying!"</p>

    <p>While the two were discussing, Sun Rong suddenly found that his nails suddenly vibrated.</p>

    <p>She thought it was because she had delayed her homework for too long. The teacher came to urge her homework. As a result, she found that she was pulled into the [Office of Strategic Deception Core Member Working Group].</p>

    <p>And the person who pulled him was none other than Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Welcome Sun Rong school girl! We will all be a family from now on! [hug][hug]"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Welcome Miss Sun Rong! [Rose]"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Welcome."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord: "[Smiles] I also wanted to attract Miss Sun before. But due to my busy work schedule, I always forget. However, General Zhuo is considerate."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Thank you everyone! But is it appropriate for me to join in like this?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "As a poor monk, I would have expected Miss Sun to join the group."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Where is MASTER! Why don't you come out and say something?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "There is a high probability that your brother is peeking at the screen. Of course. There is also a very small chance that he is embarrassed to see Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Come on. Your Majesty is still shy? He is like a wooden person. Can you imagine him hugging a pillow and coyly squirming like a maggot on the bed?"</p>

    <p>Everyone chatting in front of the screen couldn't help but "hiss..." when they saw this sentence.</p>

    <p>The picture was so beautiful. They couldn't imagine it.</p>

    <p>And at the next moment, the system prompt came: [Member ‘Er Ha' has been banned by the administrator ‘Ling Zhenren' for 6 hours]</p>

    <p>Everyone laughed bitterly in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren. Sure enough, you are peeking at the screen!</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha was severely punished, what he said just now is indeed a bit excessive.</p>

    <p>As a pet, how can you openly talk about your owner in the group?</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after successfully being promoted to a mythical beast, I was still a little confused.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This time I chose to hold a meeting in the group. It is also to discuss the collection of materials for the new Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and the possible revenge mechanism of the old Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. I have discussed the material collection privately with senior Jin Deng .I still need to trouble senior Jin Deng to pay more attention to this matter."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng nodded and typed: "It is a matter of concern to all the people in the world. It is the responsibility of the poor monk."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then below. I will initiate a one-touch call. Connect with Miss Ajuan. Make a temporary call with the members of our group. Miss Ajuan, please say hello to everyone!"</p>

    <p>"Na na na? Can you hear me?"</p>

    <p>The familiar sound of the old suona came, making everyone involuntarily feel a very intimate feeling.</p>

    <p>Last night she explored the depths of the extraterrestrial galaxy. It was not because she really went there for Wang Ying. She did have important matters to deal with.</p>

    <p>If he were not helpless, Ajuan would never choose to ask the Office of Strategic Deception for help at this time.</p>

    <p>The King of the Divine Realm also wants to save face.</p>

    <p>God Realm and the Heavenly Dao star attached to the God Realm. Although it is currently in a cooperative relationship with the Office of Strategic Deception, Ms. Ajuan will never ask anyone else for help unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

    <p>"So what happened?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"This incident happened quite suddenly. To put it simply, Heavenly Dao star is a little out of control at the moment." Miss Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>This matter gave her quite a headache. The main reason was that until now, she, not even the King of the God Realm, could figure out what went wrong, which caused the Heavenly Dao planet to go out of control.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What are the specific manifestations of loss of control?"</p>

    <p>"In order to expand the territory of Heavenly Dao, the Lord of Heavenly Dao made Heavenly Dao absorb other planets and forcibly merged the major planets."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan said: "It's like a big fish eating a small fish. After absorbing other planets, the Heavenly Dao planet became bigger and bigger. It merged with thousands of different cosmic creatures. It was ruled by the Shenlong tribe. What happened later Everyone knows about it. We were sanctioned by Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded: "Everyone remembers this. However, as the King of the God Realm, Miss Ajuan is indeed fulfilling her responsibilities very well. She led the development of Heavenly Dao and changed her mind. She began to take the maintenance of peace as her own responsibility."</p>

    <p>"This is also a kind of atonement. It is for this reason that I was elected."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan sighed: "Heavenly Dao used to swallow other planets. This was with our instructions. But now... Heavenly Dao started to swallow other planets without any instructions at all! And the speed of swallowing. Much faster than before!!"</p>

    <p>"When did it start to get out of hand?"</p>

    <p>"yesterday!"</p>

    <p>These words made Lord Diulei think deeply.</p>

    <p>Because the upgrade of Aohai happened to be completed yesterday.</p>

    <p>If he guessed correctly.</p>

    <p>The phenomenon of the Heavenly Dao star going out of control is probably closely related to the "Revenge of the Rubik's Cube."</p>

    <p>So now. The problem comes again.</p>

    <p>If there is a connection between the two.</p>

    <p>The existence of the Heavenly Dao star is actually very mysterious.</p>

    <p>This is obviously an affiliated planet under the God Realm. It can actually be related to Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao. Wasn't it created by God?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Diulei raised his head and asked boldly: "Miss Ajuan, please tell the truth."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan was obviously silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then, she replied: "The Heavenly Dao star was actually given to Old God by Dao Ancestor Wang as a token of love..."</p>
