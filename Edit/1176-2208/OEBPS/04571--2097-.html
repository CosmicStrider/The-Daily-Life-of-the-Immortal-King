  <h1>Chapter 2097 The world's troublemaker</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Previously, when all the cultivators united as one and the people of all countries united at the entrance of the restricted area, they sailed into the restricted area peacefully. As a sword master, Yi Jianchuan's first reaction was to be surprised.</p>

    <p>After all, he is also a senior figure in today's earthly cultivation world who has witnessed the evolution of the entire modern cultivation civilization. He enjoys a reputation around the world and is highly respected. He even has a certain say in the International Federation of Cultivators.</p>

    <p>That's the National Council of Cultivators. It's a place where major cultivators sit down to discuss important matters. Emperor may not necessarily participate. But those who can speak in that kind of place represent the image of a major cultivator nation.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan. He is the Huaxiu Sword Master. He is also one of the important representatives sent by Huaxiu Alliance to participate in the National Show Alliance. He has participated in thousands of conferences.</p>

    <p>In the National Cultivation Alliance, Huaxiu is also one of the four permanent representatives of the association. Therefore, on the modern cultivation network, Huaxiu, Mixiu, Xiongxiu and Lan Xiu are also known as the Four Good People...</p>

    <p>It is said that thousands of years ago, there were still five permanent representatives. But... one day, one of them inexplicably raised a white flag and quit...</p>

    <p>All in all, today's modern cultivation world is generally under the framework of peace. Modern wars rarely occur. Even if they do, they will not be wars between the world's cultivation countries.</p>

    <p>Of course, peace or non-peace, stability or instability, ordinary monks in the Cultivation Kingdom cannot decide. It also depends on whether some Cultivation Congress will set the pace.</p>

    <p>Seeing Yi Jianchuan's calm expression, Wang Muyu was also curious: "The teacher has known about it for a long time. Will they intervene?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah... I can count. I didn't expect them to be so directly involved in this matter." Yi Jianchuan nodded. He wanted to say that Mixiu Country is the most unstable factor in world peace today. This country Since the founding of the country, he has been famous for skinning on the battlefield. He makes a living by selling the black technology of cultivation. What he makes is the war wealth extracted from the piles of blood and bones.</p>

    <p>Among the people, Michu has always been given a resounding nickname: the troublemaker of world peace...</p>

    <p>The incident in the restricted sea area originally arose out of the search for the missing general Mykoasi. However, due to Michu's move, ships from all over the world gathered in this restricted area.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan had actually thought of it at that time. Under such circumstances, if the bellicose Mixiu Emperor seized the opportunity to sow discord among the major cultivating countries, it would easily lead to a direct war.</p>

    <p>Even if it is just one ship firing a cannon at another ship, it will be directly cited as their reason for war. After all, as the "shit stirrup" of world peace, the reasons they used in the past were very overbearing and rude. One of your own has been lost. I want to send a special cultivation team to your territory to look for it...</p>

    <p>Why do you suspect that a certain cultivating country is researching a secret magic weapon. It has strong lethality. In order to maintain world peace, you have to go to that country's land to find out. Destroy the magic weapon to maintain stability.</p>

    <p>As a result, when I left, I didn't find the magic weapon. I only found a bottle of white powder with a terrifying name. Some people said that it might just be washing powder.</p>

    <p>The key is just to take them away. When they left, they also dug up a large number of spiritual stones from the Xiong Cultivation Nation. They also said that these spiritual stones were all dropped on the road. They are ownerless things. Whoever picks them up belongs to them.</p>

    <p>Arrogant, rude, unreasonable, double standards, back-tracking... the biggest impression left by the recent Mixiu Emperor in the modern international cultivation society. At the same time, they also like to think nonsense. They like to inexplicably treat people as nonsense. Enemy. Use your own thinking to figure out whether others will hurt you.</p>

    <p>The reason is impossible. Just because in the long history of cultivation, they have made their fortune by invading again and again.</p>

    <p>They are too familiar with how to invade others. It is precisely because they are too familiar that they keep thinking about what they will do if it is their turn to be invaded.</p>

    <p>Now they haven't discovered the person behind the restricted area. The Mixiu fleet suddenly appeared in groups.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui had clearly thrown the monks from various countries out of the restricted sea area before. How could they suddenly appear here under normal circumstances?</p>

    <p>Then the truth is even simpler.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Michu has reached some kind of agreement with a certain mysterious monk hiding deep in the restricted area of the sea.</p>

    <p>Of course, the above are just Yi Jianchuan's own guesses.</p>

    <p>When he eloquently analyzed the exit, even Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui were extremely surprised. They admired the sword master's strategic vision and quick thinking ability.</p>

    <p>Gu Yan had to say, this guess is indeed close to ten.</p>

    <p>"What to do?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui hesitated.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Now, it is indeed difficult to handle.</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception Although it is true that it is the number one sect now, the Michu fleet has been surrounded. This is no longer just an issue between sects.</p>

    <p>During the period after the Office of Strategic Deception grew in strength, there were initially remarks to smear the Office of Strategic Deception in some other cultivation countries. They called the Office of Strategic Deception a country within a country, in an attempt to instigate the relationship between the Office of Strategic Deception and Huaxiu's Emperor. conflicts between.</p>

    <p>Therefore, where the Office of Strategic Deception was established, Lord Diulei chose to let Huaxiu Alliance become a shareholder. This was also out of consideration for the international future.</p>

    <p>In the country, they can still decide on the communication between sects. There is no need to report everything to Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>But things are different now.</p>

    <p>Sea restricted area. This is the high seas. It is not affiliated with any cultivation country.</p>

    <p>Michu's fleet surrounded them like this. It was obviously a strategic threat. He wanted them not to go deeper.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui Yue Lingwei looked at each other for a while. In the end, it was the Sword Master who hit the headrest first. Even in the face of being surrounded by so many ships, he flew out towards the skylight without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>The moment he saw Yi Jianchuan's figure, a leading soldier from the leading ship immediately let out a voice. I wonder if it was because he was worried that the sword master would not understand. What he said was still in Mandarin: "Yi Jian Sheng. There is danger ahead. Please go back as always. From today on, I, Mixiu, will be responsible for the safety supervision of this restricted sea area. Don't worry about it, Sword Master."</p>

    <p>These words made Yi Jianchuan laugh out loud immediately: "This sea is a restricted area. It is high seas. According to the convention signed by the countries of the Alliance of Nations, it does not belong to any cultivating country. I want to ask about it. Is it said that it is under the jurisdiction of Misu? Where did it come from?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it was ordered by Mixiu Emperor. A large number of our ships are here. This is what Mr. Emperor arranged here in advance. And it is also direct evidence. It proves that I, Mixiu, have jurisdiction here."</p>

    <p>"Mixiu... you are truly the world's policeman."</p>

    <p>At this point, the sword master laughed even louder: "So, according to your meaning, can it be understood that you have many ships, and the ships are your direct evidence?"</p>

    <p>"Exactly."</p>

    <p>"Then let me tell you. I also have direct evidence. And it is more direct than your evidence."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Sword Master. Is there any evidence? You also have so many ships?"</p>

    <p>"That's not true."</p>

    <p>The next second, the Sword Master directly asked a soul question: "Let me ask you something. What language did you just say to me?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"You are using my native language of Huaxiu, but here you are saying that this restricted sea area has been supervised by you, Mixiu. I think this seems inappropriate, right?"</p>
