  <h1>Chapter 2033 The Sun Family's Mountain-Suppressing Knight</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a pool of dried blood. But judging from the color of the blood, it didn't take too long to form. It is contaminated with some spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only glanced at it and knew it in his heart. The bloodstains did not come from Mingyue Ye. Because he has now become a weapon spirit. The weapon spirit does not bleed. Once it is hit, there will be continuous spiritual power on the body. The powder falls out. This powder can also be called utensil scraps.</p>

    <p>In addition to being injured, which will cause the body to drop spiritual shavings, recycling and destroying the spiritual energy using normal procedures will also produce spiritual shavings.</p>

    <p>In the old spiritual weapon recycling market in the city, there are spiritual weapon dealers who recycle these "artifact scraps" and use them to create new spiritual weapons.</p>

    <p>The higher the quality of the spiritual weapon, the higher the quality of the spirit shavings. Just like today, Mingyue Ye was hit by himself with spirit shavings. A gram of these spirit shavings falling out of his body was worth thousands of gold. You can buy it. A warehouse of crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>Taking his thoughts back, Wang Ling turned his gaze to the row of holes ahead.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya understood immediately when he saw this. He quickly followed Wang Ling's line of sight and walked over. As a result, he also found similar blood stains at the entrance of the cave.</p>

    <p>"It seems. This is a guide. Mr. Boss Sun no longer has to worry about whether he remembers it wrong. But where did this blood stain come from?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya squatted down and wiped the blood with his fingertips. Then he brought it up to his nose and smelled it.</p>

    <p>A mature alchemist can distinguish the taste of thousands of spiritual plants and herbs by the smell of herbs just by relying on memory. There is no need to question the ability of smell.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what Mr. Boss Sun thinks. If this junior's judgment is correct, this blood stain does not look like the blood of ordinary living beings." At this time, Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the mountain-suppressing knights in the ancestral land have activated it." Sun Yiyuan said with a slight frown.</p>

    <p>"Knight of the Mountain? Dare you ask Mr. Boss Sun. Is this a protection mechanism?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Sun Yiyuan nodded: "Since the ancestor has the ability to hide his ancestral land in these hundreds of thousands of mountains and lay out so many traps, of course, it does not rule out what should be done if a foreign enemy insists on invading. Carry out effective defense."</p>

    <p>"Traps are dead, but people are alive. But it is unrealistic to send people to guard them all the time. Therefore, the existence of the mountain-suppressing knight was born. If you look at it from the perspective of modern cultivation, you can understand it as a battle puppet. A kind of."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Hearing this, Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Immortal Toya nodded.</p>

    <p>Combat puppets have a long history. I just didn't expect that they were born in such a long time. In the modern world of cultivation, it is not difficult to assist the mass production of puppets through scientific means.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has already seen this in the spirit world trial field. There are a large number of Golden Core combat puppets. Almost all of them are quickly formed using electronic software operations. They can also customize their faces.</p>

    <p>But in such a long time, when science and technology were not so developed, these battle puppets had to be fabricated one by one.</p>

    <p>In essence, the "ancient magic weapons" created by Fenmu Shen are actually "combat puppets." However, the appearance of the ancient magic weapons is obviously higher.</p>

    <p>Although he was also beaten by Wang Ling, he was much stronger than the battle puppets on Earth.</p>

    <p>So how strong is this "mountain-suppressing knight" created by the founder of the Sun family?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it should be between the ancient divine weapons and the ordinary battle puppets on the earth.</p>

    <p>"So, this blood comes from the Mountain Knight?" The expression on Sun Rong's face was slightly surprised: "Grandpa, but in the body of a modern battle puppet, although the muscles and blood vessels can be reproduced, it can't be done. Is it made using bionic means? How did the previous battle puppets do it?"</p>

    <p>"Naturally, the effect is achieved by collecting the blood of spiritual beasts, holy beasts and even higher ancient ferocious beasts that we have never seen before. Then through certain magic means." Gu</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan replied: "So the Mountain-Suppressing Knight designed by Master Ancestor is extremely strong. It is a weapon to resist the invasion of foreign enemies. But under normal circumstances, the Mountain-Suppressing Knight cannot be easily awakened. He has a sensory array in his body. Normal state It will fall into a state of petrification and condensation. It will only be activated when it feels that there is a malicious foreign enemy invading the ancestral land."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, the expression on Sun Yiyuan's face suddenly became tense. He originally thought that the intruder who tried to break into the Sun family's ancestral land was not a remarkable person.</p>

    <p>But now that the mountain knights are activated, the danger is completely different.</p>

    <p>That mountain knight... But people from the True Immortal realm won't even move an inch if they invade...</p>

    <p>And now that it's activated, it proves that the invader's level of strength ranks above True Immortal.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. Rongrong also has... classmate Wang Ling. I think this visit to the ancestral land will end here."</p>

    <p>The more Sun Yiyuan thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong. Then he turned around with an apologetic look. He looked at Wang Ling and Sun Rong and said: "For safety reasons, I think it is safer to take you out. This time the intruder. I'm afraid it will be difficult to deal with. Even the Zhenshan Knight was beaten to death. The two of them should still be fighting. I will bring you here after I confirm that the danger in the ancestral land has been eliminated."</p>

    <p>This was Sun Yiyuan's decision based on the logical thinking of a normal person. Moreover, he made this judgment for the safety of Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After all, Mr. Boss Sun doesn't know what's in front of him. One is the newly promoted Golden Core, the number one on earth.</p>

    <p>The other one is a seemingly harmless monster...</p>

    <p>"Immortal. I will leave the children to your care. I am going to check the situation. I will send you back to the submarine now." Sun Yiyuan said nothing. He took out a golden teleportation talisman from his sleeve. One for each person. Posted on the foreheads of Sun Rong, Wang Ling and Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Then he circulated his spiritual power and formed seals with his hands. Wang Ling felt a flash of white light in front of his eyes. He was immediately sent back to the previous immortal stone inscribed with "Beyond the Three Realms. Not Among the Five Elements." ahead.</p>

    <p>"In the end, it still turned out like this." Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Although he was sent back by Boss Sun, but now that he is not with him, it is much easier for him to use his fists and kicks.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye is a dangerous person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know how powerful the mountain-suppressing knight developed by the founder of the Sun family is. But Mr. Boss Sun went directly to investigate without knowing anything. the old man will suffer in the end. Own.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is a good man.</p>

    <p>Judging from several contacts. Wang Ling actually feels that the personalities of myself and the old man are quite compatible.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to play a long game and catch the big fish. He kept Mingyue Ye alive so that he could hook out more alien beings hidden on the earth who were hostile and malicious towards the earth.</p>

    <p>But looking at it now, it seems that he has to kill Ming Yueye.</p>

    <p>Because otherwise, Mr. Boss Sun, as the head of the Sun family, will definitely make Mingyue Ye regard Mr. Boss Sun as a new hunting target after this trip to the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>"You guys are here. Wait for me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>His eyes were calm. There was no trace of emotion in his eyes. He looked like a butcher who was about to kill a chicken. He was afraid that the blood of the chicken would get on him. As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves.</p>
