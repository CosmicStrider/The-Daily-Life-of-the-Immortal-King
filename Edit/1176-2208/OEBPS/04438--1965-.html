  <h1>Chapter 1965 Gradually forgetting the purpose</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The tenth level of the mist-resolving technique. Water Mist Mirror Flower...</p>

    <p>Luo Lan had only used this secret technique once in public practice. Therefore, the data is extremely precious.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Jiutian Jingmi Academy is worthy of being a pioneer institution in recruiting talents. Even with such rare data, there are still records in their backend database.</p>

    <p>Under Jing Heqiu's simultaneous search, the data comparison results appeared quickly.</p>

    <p>"Exactly the same... it's really the tenth level of the Mist Resolving Technique. Water Mist Mirror Flower!" He was surprised.</p>

    <p>In fact, before Teng Luchen confirmed that Li Changzhe had used "Water Mist Mirror Flower", many people at the scene were already in shock.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a unique skill that Luo Lan only used once in public. Such a unique skill can be reproduced now. This is definitely something that cannot be learned through hard work alone. It must have been given guidance by Luo Lan!</p>

    <p>In other words, it is almost certain that Li Changzhe is a disciple of the fog master Luo Lan!</p>

    <p>"Okay, okay! What a great harvest!"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen laughed so hard that he  wanted to open his mouth from ear to ear. Such joy stimulated his mind, making him completely forget about Wang Ling for the time being.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations to Mr. Teng! Congratulations to Mr. Teng! We have found two more hidden real talents!"</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu immediately led the others to bow and congratulate: "Although this time it seems that we did not find out whether Wang Ling has a hidden identity, we did find out Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan, two talented people... Mr. Teng's vision is really accurate! It is simply destiny!"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen was very proud. This compliment made him even more elated.</p>

    <p>But after all, in front of so many people, he still managed to keep his expression neutral.</p>

    <p>After clearing his throat, he hurriedly said: "Lao Qiu, immediately launch the talent care plan. Special attention and protection must be given to classmates Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan. At the same time, people must be sent to contact their families in secret. This must not be allowed to escape. The two will be poached by foreign schools."</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu nodded: "That classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. We have already gained a lot this time. Anyway, there are still a few days until the sect competition. If he is really a talent, he will definitely show his flaws." Teng Luchen said with a smile and waved his hand.</p>

    <p>All his attention and mental strength were on Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan at the moment. He felt an inexplicable sense of solidity in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although he has not completely given up on tracing Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But after discovering the two hidden master disciples, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan, for a moment, Teng Luchen felt that Wang Ling didn't seem so important.</p>

    <p>"By the way. Lao Qiu, don't forget to find the whereabouts of the Arrow God Chu Tianjue and the Mist God Luo Lan. I want to know the place where they last appeared. It must be accurate. Contact with them. I will go there personally." Teng Luchen said.</p>

    <p>"I understand, Mr. Teng." Jing Heqiu nodded and bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side of the battlefield, Qu Shuling, who was already injured, was caught off guard by Li Changzhe's "Water Mist Mirror Flower" and was sent flying on the spot.</p>

    <p>This punch hit the cheek. Although it could not be said to be a vital part, it was unexpected. The fist hit the exact edge of Qu Shuling's Tianling Cap. The shock wave of the physical fist collision knocked Qu Shuling unconscious on the spot.</p>

    <p>He was injured in the first place and was in a state of neglecting precautions. It was reasonable for him to be knocked unconscious with one punch.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Qu Shuling was no longer moving, Li Changzhe solidified his body into a solid body again. He didn't know why he felt that he was far from reaching his limit today.</p>

    <p>If Qu Shuling hadn't fainted, his mist-removing technique could have continued. It seems that there would be no problem for a few more hours...</p>

    <p>It's strange. Although there were times when there were extraordinary performances in the past, today this is not considered extraordinary performance at all. It is simply the ultimate evolution!</p>

    <p>"Okay, Li Changzhe... you are indeed related to the God of Mist Luo Lan! That move just now was definitely the Water Mist Mirror Flower!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan preemptively asked: "Don't try to fool me. This move is not ordinary. Without years of hard training, you can't fool me even if you hit it right!"</p>

    <p>"..." Li Changzhe was speechless for a moment. He stared at Zhang Linyan and secretly thought about the cunningness of women. It was obvious that she had just shot Chu Tianjue's giant arrow! But now she turned her attention directly to himself!</p>

    <p>"You ask me that... What about you..."</p>

    <p>He was about to ask a question, but Zhang Linyan immediately changed the subject. She looked at Qu Shuling who fainted: "Now is not the time to talk about this. The key is Qu Shuling. How to deal with him."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe sighed: "It's really difficult to handle. It would be a bit unkind to send him away while he is unconscious. And eliminating him would not be good for us. After all, we are still in the same gang."</p>

    <p>"But if he wakes up, he will definitely be dissatisfied. If he still stalks us, it will be difficult to handle."</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan had a headache; "By the way, I have a spirit-binding god here. It's a magic weapon I got after entering the trial field. How about I tie him up first?"</p>

    <p>At this time, a group of miners who had been hiding in the distance and watching shiveringly for a long time came over under the leadership of Tieyi.</p>

    <p>The script once again developed according to the results that no one expected. As the leader of the miners, Tieyi naturally received new instructions from the command post.</p>

    <p>He immediately looked at Wang Ling and said, "Let's do this, you three. I think we'll follow Miss Zhang's wishes. We'll tie him up with spiritual weapons first. Then we'll send a few brothers to take turns keeping an eye on him."</p>

    <p>"But what if he wakes up?" Zhang Linyan asked.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Miss Zhang. We brothers won't let him wake up..."</p>

    <p>"Brother Tieyi means..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan looked horrified: "But it wouldn't be good to kill him..."</p>

    <p>"No. I didn't say kill him... Miss Zhang misunderstood."</p>

    <p>Tieyi wiped his sweat and said, "Although the area around here is in a mess now, I know that a little deeper into the back mountain, there is a spiritual fruit called Deep Dream. The collected Deep Dream is ground into jam. Give it to him every two hours. He takes some. It makes sure he doesn't wake up."</p>

    <p>"There is actually a Deep Dream Fruit here?" Li Changzhe raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Yes. We were also surprised." Tieyi smiled awkwardly: "Earlier, when the fierce battle among you was in full swing, a few of our brothers went out to explore the road. Only then did we discover that there is a Deep Dream Fruit here... It's like it suddenly grew a large piece of it."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe burst out laughing when he heard this: "How could such a rare spiritual fruit suddenly grow into a large area? There is no magic weapon to catalyze it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>All I can say is that the Deep Dream Fruit is a very rare fourth-level spiritual fruit.</p>

    <p>If combined with other spiritual plants to refine medicine, it will have unexpected effects.</p>

    <p>This is a well-known stabilizer for elixirs. It can neutralize some powerful medicinal properties of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. This allows the refined elixirs to be better absorbed by the human body.</p>

    <p>But if it is just used as an ordinary sleeping pill, it would be a bit wasteful.</p>

    <p>But now, this seems to be the only way to stabilize Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Deep Dream Fruit is harmless to the human body. Moreover, Qu Shuling is injured now. With the help of Deep Dream Fruit, it will also help to recover a certain amount of injuries during sleep.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan still considered the subsequent impact.</p>

    <p>Although they all don't like Qu Shuling, this one is indeed a top genius in the minds of many people. If Qu Shuling is directly eliminated due to internal fighting, all of their elite cultivators from Huaxiu Country may face ridicule from outside.</p>

    <p>After making the decision to place Qu Shuling, Li Changzhe looked at Zhanye who had cracked the sword next to Qu Shuling's body.</p>

    <p>He thought about it and finally decided to disarm him.</p>

    <p>Then, Li Changzhe picked it up directly and handed it to Wang Ling: "Brother Wang Ling. Brother Qu's Zhanye will be temporarily given to you for safekeeping. The sword spirit and the sword master are connected spiritually. Brother Qu is now asleep. The sword spirit is also in a comatose state. There is no danger if you take him."</p>

    <p>"You are the weakest. You still use that useless peach wood sword. Although this Zhanye sword is cracked, it is still very useful. It can be used for self-defense."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
