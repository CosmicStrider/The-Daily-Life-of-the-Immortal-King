  <h1>Chapter 1603 The defeated Ueki Kimisan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Xian has long seen through the nature of the problem. In the final analysis, this is Duyan's own choice. He is too lazy for an outsider to interfere.</p>

    <p>Duyan is a smart man.</p>

    <p>Although this act apparently controlled the entire Jiugong family, it was actually an attempted crime that did not result in any deaths.</p>

    <p>In terms of sentencing, it should not be as direct as the death penalty.</p>

    <p>You may be sentenced to a long time.</p>

    <p>But even if he is sentenced to a long time, he probably won't have the chance to be locked up with the mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>The Mahjong trio actually had no interaction with Li Xian. But he knew so many things. Naturally, Wang Ling passed all the basic information to him.</p>

    <p>He knows very well. For Wang Ling, he is just a "tool man." He will inevitably have to help out with more errands in the future.</p>

    <p>However, Li Xian doesn't care about this "positioning."</p>

    <p>Especially after he clearly realized the gap between himself and Wang Ling. He felt that working under Wang Ling seemed to be a good choice.</p>

    <p>Just think of it as a practice.</p>

    <p>He finished his second cigarette on the balcony. Seeing Jiugong Xiushi sitting in a wheelchair with a depressed look, he suddenly felt that the atmosphere was a little sad.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Li, can I ask a question?" Jiugong Xiushi asked.</p>

    <p>"You said."</p>

    <p>"Why don't you tell my father the truth."</p>

    <p>"Because it means Miss Jiugong."</p>

    <p>"she?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi showed an incredible expression.</p>

    <p>"Miss Jiugong Liangzi knows your heart very clearly. But she doesn't want to care about it."</p>

    <p>"But...why..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi lowered his head: "She obviously hates me the most...I am a cripple. I have not made any contribution to the Jiugong family..."</p>

    <p>"But you are still her brother."</p>

    <p>Li Xian said: "Remember when she was a child and she took you to the temple fair with her in a wheelchair? Did you buy apple candies for her? Just this is enough."</p>

    <p>These few short sentences have already aroused Jiugong Xiushi's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi didn't know which of his muscles was wrong. His tears kept falling like broken beads.</p>

    <p>"Your legs should have healed a long time ago. No matter how many excessive things you did to Miss Liangzi in the past, since she chose to forgive you, outsiders like me naturally have no right to say anything."</p>

    <p>Li Xian said softly. He patted Jiugong Xiushi on the shoulder: "A man's leg can be broken, but it cannot be broken for a lifetime. Even if you do something wrong, stand up and take responsibility. There is no shame in it."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Li Xian returned to the banquet hall alone.</p>

    <p>He felt that his mission this time was carried out fairly smoothly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is given to all the powerful warriors of Corpse Map including Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. The mission points system is adopted.</p>

    <p>Each time you complete a task, you will be rewarded with corresponding points. When the points are reached, you can reshape your body and gain freedom.</p>

    <p>This is a very fair deal.</p>

    <p>Points. To Li Xian and other eternal strong men, they are money.</p>

    <p>Li Xian thought that he had never done this before in his eight lifetimes. But since he had accepted the task, he naturally wanted to do it more beautifully.</p>

    <p>Make money.</p>

    <p>Not shabby.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, the Sun Island High School Student Ranking Closed Competition. Wang Ling officially won the title as "Wang Houlang."</p>

    <p>This is something that even Wang Ling did not expect.</p>

    <p>Mainly. Wang Ling didn't do anything during the whole process...</p>

    <p>Every opponent I met claimed to be from Gray Cult. And they were also their fans.</p>

    <p>A good game...he was "sent" to first place.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is that these people even put on a show at the beginning.</p>

    <p>Then the show continued. Even the referees at the scene said that they were Gray Cult fans. The referee's ball judgment mechanism was artificially modified. So even if the performance of this game was fake, it would not be judged as a fake match.</p>

    <p>In front of me, all the opponents Wang Ling encountered were falling one by one like dominoes.</p>

    <p>And when the 1 million Sun Island coins from the competition were put into Wang Ling's digital wallet. Wang Ling still feels like he hasn't reacted yet...</p>

    <p>He has never had such an easy game.</p>

    <p>The money was obtained. And he himself was not too pushy... and did not violate the Old Wang family's family motto of keeping a low profile.</p>

    <p>And it's more than that.</p>

    <p>Through this wave of closed-door matches, Gray Cult's rules are likely to be further expanded on Sun Island...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Office. Ueki Kimisan's plan to try to find trouble in the closed-door match also collapsed when some people in the venue, from students, teachers to coaches, openly rebelled.</p>

    <p>He still hasn't figured out what happened.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the foreign Mr. Holland sitting next to him also became extremely ugly after answering the phone.</p>

    <p>Because... just one minute ago, the educational investment financial institution they were in was acquired!</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Jiudaohe family offered a price that the major shareholders could not refuse. The merger was completed!</p>

    <p>This means that the actual control of Jiudaohe High School is now back in the hands of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>"This is impossible!" Ueki Kimisan roared immediately when he heard the news.</p>

    <p>He couldn't accept this fact.</p>

    <p>As a pure-blooded shepherd dog, he has invested all his savings and efforts in this foreign-funded educational institution in Holland in order to one day realize his true ambition. Become the principal of Jiudaohe! Complete Jiudaohe Hold it in your hand!</p>

    <p>But now. The actual controlling stake has been overturned in a short period of time...</p>

    <p>This is something Ueki Kimisan never imagined.</p>

    <p>"Who did this?" Ueki Kimisan grabbed Holland's collar, looking furious.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ueki, please calm down..." Holland also showed a helpless expression: "This matter is the work of Jiugong Akagi of Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>In fact, even if Holland didn't say it, Ueki Kimisan could still think of it.</p>

    <p>In the Jiugong family, which other adult can gather funds in a short period of time and directly annex other industries like a big fish eating a small fish with such a bold and wealthy attitude?</p>

    <p>"Akagi? It's him..."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan suddenly felt as if all the strength had been relieved from his body. He only felt that his body was unstable: "Akagi...isn't he not optimistic about education? How could he suddenly want to be a principal..."</p>

    <p>"Tell you a scary story. Mr. Ueki Kimisan."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Holland whispered: "It is said that Mr. Jiugong Akagi has also become a Gray Cult believer..."</p>

    <p>"Huh?" Ueki Kimisan had a question mark on his face.</p>

    <p>Holland: "Tell you another scary story. Mr. Holland..."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan: "?"</p>

    <p>Holland: "Actually, I am too..."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan: "</p>
