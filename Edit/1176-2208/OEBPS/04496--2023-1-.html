  <h1>Chapter 2023 Rescued 1. Mr. Canghu?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Judging from the illusion of the Great Rewind Technique, this whale is extremely large. It is hundreds of times larger than the normal spirit whale. It is an ancient whale that has lived for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>"The back of this whale is almost like a sun island, isn't it?" Sun Rong was also particularly surprised.</p>

    <p>Then she looked at Wang Ling with a look of realization. The two of them had the same thought. They thought of the same thing almost instantly: "Could it be that... our Sun family's ancestral land is inside the body of this ancient whale?"</p>

    <p>"Very possible."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya also agreed with this view. But then he frowned and said, "But this ancient whale is too big. Even if it is hidden in the deep sea, once it surfaces, the shock wave caused will cause a small-scale tsunami. But judging from the retrospection effect of the illusion just now, this ancient whale should have the ability to independently control the size of its body."</p>

    <p>"In other words, it deliberately kept its body like an ordinary spirit whale when it floated up. Then when it approached the target, it instantly enlarged its body and swallowed it directly. Then it returned its body to normal size?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded. This directly verified Sun Rong's guess.</p>

    <p>This is the most reasonable answer that can be thought of at present. Otherwise, it stands to reason that such a large ancient whale would have been detected.</p>

    <p>In addition, Wang Ling also remembered that in recent years there have been rumors of prehistoric spiritual beasts in the depths of the East Huaxiu Sea. This further strengthened Wang Ling's inner thoughts.</p>

    <p>If this ancient whale had the ability to independently control the size of its body, then it would be difficult to detect it by disguising itself as an ordinary spirit whale and mixing in among the spirit whales on the seabed.</p>

    <p>Of course. What surprised Wang Ling a little was not the ability of this ancient whale to control the size of its body. It was the fact that this ancient whale actually had space-based abilities.</p>

    <p>On the earth, there are very few spiritual beasts with space spell abilities. The most common spell ability of many space spirit beasts is teleportation. Even if the distance is not too far, such a one can control space spells. Spirit beasts can also be sold for sky-high contract prices.</p>

    <p>If his reasoning is correct, the Sun family's ancestral land is likely to be in the body of this ancient whale.</p>

    <p>And this ancient whale that has lived for thousands of years... No, it may have lived for tens of thousands of years. The space system ability it controls is more advanced than the space system ability currently known on the earth!</p>

    <p>This is a devouring ability.</p>

    <p>It's called "Whale Swallowing the World." Wang Ling knows it from those mythical beasts bred from chaos.</p>

    <p>In this case, the origin of this ancient whale is a bit intriguing.</p>

    <p>There might actually be a chaotic beast hidden in this huge East Huaxiu Sea?</p>

    <p>Moreover, he lies low-key and dormant in the depths of the East Huaxiu Sea all year round. He only surfaces when the Sun family needs to worship their ancestors and allows the head of the Sun family to enter...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the founder of the Sun family back then was not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>There have been rumors in the world of cultivation for a long time that Zhenyuan Immortal is the first person on earth to break through the realm and reach the realm of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Wang Ling has an intuition. He feels that this may also be the result of the joint efforts of some powerful people hiding behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>They launched Zhenyuan Immortal, the first Venerated Immortal, and then hid themselves behind the scenes to use this as a cover...</p>

    <p>This method is actually similar to Wang Ling pushing Zhuo Yi out to block the front.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Help... help..."</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was thinking about how to find this ancient whale from the bottom of the sea, a disembodied cry for help attracted the attention of three people.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw a humanoid creature that looked very similar to a Tibetan fox<sup>1</sup> floating on the sea holding a piece of driftwood from a distance. His condition looked very wrong. He was very weak. He made an extremely weak cry for help.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("藏狐" "Cang Hu" translates to "Tibetan Fox.")</dfn>

    <p>If Wang Ling hadn't been able to clearly distinguish the sound from the unfathomable realm, no one would have noticed the cry for help from this humanoid creature. Because the sound of the waves was much louder, it would have directly covered his voice.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw this and almost immediately took out a golden pellet from the storage bag. Then she threw it into the sea.</p>

    <p>This pill looks like a pill, but it's actually a concentrated magic weapon. It can condense huge objects into this small pill and put it to use at critical moments.</p>

    <p>Generally, the most common thing is to seal the Spirit Bus inside.</p>

    <p>However, the Sun family has a big business. Naturally, there are many things that can be sealed.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong dropped the ball into the sea, accompanied by a burst of rising white mist, a huge submarine came directly into everyone's sight.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling saw this. The corners of his eyes couldn't help but twitch.</p>

    <p>"As expected of you. Miss Sun..." Immortal Toya was also surprised. Although he had long been reminded of the tyranny of the Sun family, the operation of directly summoning a submarine was a bit unexpected.</p>

    <p>"The props I have here can be used on the sea. This is the smallest size." Sun Rong said. She took out another ball: "This one has an aircraft carrier sealed inside."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling, Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"That's not necessary. Miss Sun, it's more important to save him..." Immortal Toya smiled awkwardly and not politely. Then he followed Wang Ling, Sun Rong and landed on the door with the character "Sun" engraved on it. On a huge submarine.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong summoned Aohai. Use the power of Aohai to gently lift a water column. She directly picked up Mr. Canghu floating on the sea in the distance.</p>

    <p>"Ahem..." Mr. Canghu, who was rescued, kept spitting out seawater. He looked extremely painful.</p>

    <p>"Are you okay, sir? Hey. It stands to reason that you have already cultivated into human form. You should be very strong. Why can't you swim?" Sun Rong asked with concern, looking at the humanoid creature in front of him.</p>

    <p>After Immortal Toya urgently checked the other party's body, he looked at Sun Rong and smiled bitterly: "Miss Sun... this gentleman is not a humanoid spirit beast... but a serious human being."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this. Her face instantly turned red: "I'm sorry, sir... I. I didn't mean it."</p>

    <p>"It's okay... I'm often misunderstood by people. I'm used to it. And people do call me Mr. Canghu as a nickname. It doesn't matter..."</p>

    <p>After finishing speaking, Mr. Canghu waved the fox tail behind him. He swallowed the spiritual power supply pill handed over by Immortal Toya. He felt that his weak body had recovered a lot: "That's it. This is a side effect of my practice. would make me a kind of half-orc."</p>

    <p>"On land. With my Nascent Soul stage, I naturally wouldn't be in such a mess... But ever since the side effects of my technique took shape, my body seems to have become particularly afraid of sea water. As long as I reach the sea water, my body's spiritual energy will drain away faster..."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." The three people on the submarine all understood after hearing this.</p>

    <p>If the side effects of the exercises are not taken seriously at the beginning, it will indeed cause very unnecessary trouble. Just like Lao Gudong and Taotie Taoist.</p>

    <p>In fact, in the world of cultivation, there are quite a few human cultivators who have permanently turned into half-orcs due to the side effects of their practice.</p>

    <p>"Since you are afraid of sea water, why does Mr. Canghu come to the sea?"</p>

    <p>"Well..." Mr. Canghu wrung out the seawater from his fox tail and said, "Actually, I am a popular science scholar in the world of cultivation. My real name is Xiao Liang. People give me the nickname Mr. Canghu. I heard that there may be prehistoric spiritual beasts in the East Huaxiu Sea. That's why I couldn't suppress my curiosity and came here to investigate."</p>
