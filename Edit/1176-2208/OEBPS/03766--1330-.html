  <h1>Chapter 1330 My matrix is endless</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The petals of the Void Snow Lotus bloomed in the air. The endless void energy instantly formed a huge devouring fire, burning a huge hole in the entire space.</p>

    <p>Broken buildings, rocks and rubble were all swept in along with the blasted holes. There were even many disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception who were very close to the core area and had no time to escape.</p>

    <p>"Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"</p>

    <p>The disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception immediately noticed something strange.</p>

    <p>The alarm sounded immediately covering the sect.</p>

    <p>"Huh. A bunch of trash fish."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er ignored the disciples who poured out of the Office of Strategic Deception. With a wave of his hand, he destroyed the forbidden formation jointly arranged by the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"You want to trap me with such a level of confinement? How naive."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was too lazy to pay attention to these Office of Strategic Deception disciples jumping around.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The aura of void was released from her body. It was so strong that it shocked the soul.</p>

    <p>Those Office of Strategic Deception disciples floating in the void were like falling meteors. They fell heavily to the ground and then fell into a pit. They could not get up no matter what.</p>

    <p>Under such strong oppression, every disciple was trembling.</p>

    <p>I feel like a firefly competing with the sun and the moon. Extremely humble.</p>

    <p>"This... isn't this the Sun Rong girl... what's going on..."</p>

    <p>"Hen!"</p>

    <p>These Office of Strategic Deception disciples are puzzled.</p>

    <p>The sudden attack had left them all stunned.</p>

    <p>There is already one lying here.</p>

    <p>Why is there another one here?</p>

    <p>"As expected of Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Lord... It is exactly what he thought. She is here." At this time, in the True Venerated Immortal Hall, Zhenyuan Immortal felt strong energy fluctuations from outside.</p>

    <p>"Hmph! No matter who comes, I will protect Miss Sun's body." Miss Ajuan took out the divine feather sword and treated it seriously.</p>

    <p>There is no reason to be so concerned.</p>

    <p>She hopes to take advantage of this opportunity to further deepen her relationship with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The earth has been upgraded.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao star is still poor now.</p>

    <p>If you want to make Heavenly Dao take a step forward, it can only be achieved by relying on the power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So in essence, this is also a small calculation of Miss Ajuan as the King of the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>"What are the chances of winning if we work together?" asked the immortal man from Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>"I don't say whether she can win or not. She will definitely not get any advantage." Miss Ajuan was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>Although she is still a very weak King of the God Realm.</p>

    <p>But... we can't use her as a legal lolita as a cadre!</p>

    <p>When she is fully developed, she will be very powerful!</p>

    <p>"We have to lead her to other places... Our sect has just been built. She just blew up a building worth 300 million immortal gold." Immortal Zhenyuan wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>At this time, in front of the main hall, Sun Ying'er's figure arrived here at some unknown time.</p>

    <p>Then right in front of Zhenyuan Immortal, Sun Ying'er split into two.</p>

    <p>"Split body???"</p>

    <p>The immortal man of Zhenyuan and the girl Ajuan were shocked at the same time.</p>

    <p>The key is that the energy contained in this split body is not inferior to the original body at all! It can be said to be almost exactly the same!</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid the other party has noticed that the body in the True Venerated Immortal Hall has been replaced." Miss Ajuan frowned.</p>

    <p>"Underground there are Lord Zhuo, Heavenly Dao and Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. The target of the main body is there."</p>

    <p>"It seems that we must deal with the two split bodies in front of us as soon as possible and go to support." In the mental space, Miss Ajuan and Zhenyuan Immortal were talking.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is far more difficult than they imagined.</p>

    <p>"Want to support? It doesn't exist." The two Sun Ying'ers who appeared in the True Venerated Immortal hall had a clear goal.</p>

    <p>Each of them targeted an opponent and started a one-on-one contest.</p>

    <p>And in order not to cause further damage to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>The reactions of Zhenyuan Immortal and Miss Ajuan were also synchronized.</p>

    <p>The two actually sacrificed their core world at the same time.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was nestled inside like a matryoshka doll.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the split body is only to delay the battle and prevent support from happening.</p>

    <p>For Sun Ying'er, the goal has been completely achieved. Before coming to the Office of Strategic Deception, she had already figured out the details of everyone here.</p>

    <p>No one can escape.</p>

    <p>The only troublesome characters in Office of Strategic Deception are probably Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Lord Diulei who is taking the sword.</p>

    <p>That's right. Jingke and Bai Qiao are doing maintenance at Luo Pangzi's shop.</p>

    <p>The situation there should be similar to that of Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>Just to be on the safe side.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er sent a total of 10 splinter bodies there.</p>

    <p>Even with Jingke and Bai Qiao here, it would be enough to delay it for a while.</p>

    <p>It is actually not difficult to destroy her. But the key is that she can use the energy of the void to replicate and split without limit.</p>

    <p>And this is also one of Sun Ying'er's biggest trump cards.</p>

    <p>"Even if the entire earth is destroyed, I will take you Rongrong away."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er looked at the sky.</p>

    <p>Before her ultimate trump card is fully revealed, she still needs to delay for a while.</p>

    <p>The energy of the void is still 60% away from being fully assembled...</p>

    <p>At that time, she will make the final judgment on the earth in the name of the new master.</p>

    <p>Earth Spirit: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception retreats in the cellar. Huge energy fluctuations on the ground are directly transmitted to the depths of the earth.</p>

    <p>All the retreat rooms were shaking.</p>

    <p>"It's amazing... Son of the Void. So terrifying." Heavenly Dao frowned deeply. He never thought that the Son of the Void contained such amazing energy in his body.</p>

    <p>"Senior, what are your chances of winning?" Zhuo Yi asked with some worry.</p>

    <p>He himself has also fought against the virtual spirit. He knows how powerful the virtual spirit is.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er has appeared now. The huge energy hidden in his body cannot be matched by the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>"This... seems to be stronger than the Lord of the Void..." Death Heavenly Dao was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Why is this happening?"</p>

    <p>"There should be a system of inheritance in the Void... Once the Son of the Void is formed, the energy of the Lord of the Void will begin to transfer... and this inheritance ceremony should have started a long time ago..."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao guessed: "Otherwise, Miss Sun's shadow would not have been able to reach perfection so quickly."</p>

    <p>"So that means that once the Lord of the Void completes transmitting all his energy... the shadow of Sun Rong's school girl will be the next Lord of the Void?"</p>

    <p>"That's absolutely true! And what's even more troublesome is that Miss Sun's shadow. The shadowing ability seems to be split. With the endless void energy in the void, she can theoretically copy and split the body without limit..."</p>

    <p>"Unlimited copying and splitting?" Zhuo Yi was startled.</p>

    <p>Then won't Wang Ying be very happy in the future?</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, another huge hole appeared in front.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's true form appears here.</p>

    <p>This is 3,600 meters underground...</p>

    <p>"There is a marmot sealed in this water tower. But now there is another humanoid marmot..." Zhuo Yi wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>Inside the Golden Lotus. Sun Rong's mouth twitched. He felt a little offended.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. Come back with me. This way, we can avoid the death of many people." At this moment, Sun Ying'er stared at Sun Rong in the Golden Lotus with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>"Don't listen to her. Sun Rong girl!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord stood up. His eyes were fixed on Sun Ying'er: "Although my combat power is not as good as the master. But don't underestimate me!"</p>

    <p>"Really? Even if the earth is destroyed, it doesn't matter?" Sun Ying'er laughed.</p>

    <p>"As long as the master is here, destruction is destruction. Anyway, it can be repaired." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said firmly.</p>

    <p>Earth Spirit: "?"</p>
