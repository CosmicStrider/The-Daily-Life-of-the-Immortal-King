  <h1>Chapter 1936 You may be surrounded by friendly forces</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment the kitchen knife flew up, Wang Ling's face was filled with surprise.</p>

    <p>This smart black iron kitchen knife flew up in front of their faces. The blade passed across, and there was a crisp sound next to their ears.</p>

    <p>Lying down, Li Changzhe could even feel the subtle sound of the knife passing through her hair, cutting off his hair.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Li Changzhe felt that all the hairs on his body stood up.</p>

    <p>He never expected that what Ma Jiao said turned out to be true. This kitchen knife could actually fly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe could no longer calm down.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that at this moment, it is more appropriate to use a popular phrase on the Internet to describe Li Changzhe's performance.</p>

    <p>He was completely overwhelmed...</p>

    <p>I believe that any boy who faces the same situation as Li Changzhe will feel the same horror in his heart.</p>

    <p>He quickly got up from the ground. There was a look of fright on his face. His face turned purple with fright. It was like a fish that had been stranded on the beach for a long time.</p>

    <p>Even his breathing became extremely rapid.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The knife finally landed one centimeter in front of Li Changzhe's crotch.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao means it. If he doesn't wake up in time and get out of the way.</p>

    <p>This knife will really turn Li Changzhe into an old man.</p>

    <p>"Are all the girls nowadays so cruel..." Li Changzhe was still frightened while he was pretending to be asleep. The sweat on his cheeks kept falling. He kept thinking, "Oh!"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Li, you woke up! I thought you would never wake up again." Ma Jiao said in surprise while shedding tears excitedly, as if she was really concerned about Li Changzhe's injury.</p>

    <p>Such acting skills made Wang Ling next to him call him an expert. Ma Jiao is so ruthless.</p>

    <p>Although the appearance has changed greatly, after what happened just now, Wang Ling is convinced that this is Ma Jiao himself.</p>

    <p>He is still as sinister and weird as ever. It makes people feel confused.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha... I just felt like I had just had a nightmare. Then I suddenly woke up. But what happened to the kitchen knife? I'm not sure." Li Changzhe laughed and touched the back of his head. The expression on his face was infinitely embarrassing.</p>

    <p>This is pretending to be stupid. If you don't pretend to be stupid.</p>

    <p>It's so social...</p>

    <p>"It's okay, Classmate Li. The kitchen knife was just an accident. I saw you haven't woken up yet, so I just wanted to make something for you to eat." Ma Jiao finished saying that and looked at Wang Ling with a smile on his face: "Yes. Right. Classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"..." Li Changzhe was shocked again.</p>

    <p>This woman is simply telling lies without drafting.</p>

    <p>What a stew!</p>

    <p>But there was no way. He could only pretend not to know these things. Otherwise, he would have to admit that he was pretending to sleep just now.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Ma Jiao didn't get to the bottom of it. Her original mission was to wake Li Changzhe up. But now the mission has been successfully completed.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was actually not stupid. When he saw Ma Jiao, he did not continue to inquire. He immediately understood that this was actually Ma Jiao deliberately giving himself a step down.</p>

    <p>After all, those who can come here are the elites of high school students in the world. Pretending to be dead is not easy to fool in front of these elites. Moreover, Li Changzhe would never have thought that Wang Ling would have such a relationship with foreign students. good.</p>

    <p>He was very hostile to Number 60 High School at first. He also looked down upon Wang Ling very much. He felt that Wang Ling was just a legendary mascot. He was not worthy of competing with elite high school students like them.</p>

    <p>But now judging from various performances, Wang Ling is actually not as bad as he imagined.</p>

    <p>There is a saying that only a substitute can attract a substitute.</p>

    <p>In other words. Only good people can attract good people...</p>

    <p>So since Wang Ling can be recognized by elite foreign high school students, there must be something special about him.</p>

    <p>Although Li Changzhe still doesn't know how Wang Ling entered the teahouse door. He also doesn't know what is special about Wang Ling. From what he can see so far, he can only say that Wang Ling is a serious person. The good guy...</p>

    <p>I carried him all the way to the oasis from outside. After putting him under the tree, I kept taking care of myself on the side.</p>

    <p>Every time Li Changzhe thinks about this, he feels a little ashamed.</p>

    <p>It's because I judge a gentleman's heart with a villain's heart...</p>

    <p>"Introduce yourself. My name is Rokume Akahoko." At this time, with Ma Jiao's intervention, communication became more convenient. Ma Jiao took the initiative to announce his home address and shake hands with Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>Because the current situation on the field is far more severe than imagined. It's not just about breaking through. They also have to find ways to face threats from the outside.</p>

    <p>And this threat is currently only known to Ma Jiao and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is what I saw.</p>

    <p>He used the peripheral vision of King's Eyes to penetrate into those monitors. He verified his previous conjecture and learned that the Jingmi Institute command post was being hijacked.</p>

    <p>As for Ma Jiao, it was a message sent to her by Wang Ming in code. It was the language between hackers. Only Ma Jiao could understand it.</p>

    <p>In other words, they are now being monitored by a group of criminals.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling doesn't completely understand the ins and outs.</p>

    <p>With the strength of that old vine, it's impossible that he can't clean up those scraps...</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling understood it almost instantly.</p>

    <p>This means coming at yourself.</p>

    <p>This old man is testing himself.</p>

    <p>"Brother, you finally woke up!" Seeing Li Changzhe wake up, Zhang Linyan also hurried over. She was holding a few freshly made spiritual pebbles in her hand.</p>

    <p>The problem of battery life has been temporarily solved. With the existence of spiritual power pebbles, they no longer need to replenish their spiritual power through the cheating spiritual fruits in the oasis.</p>

    <p>She and Li Changzhe had only exchanged a few words. Suddenly, there was a slight vibration in the ground of the oasis. It was not a big movement. But people with strong senses in the oasis all felt many powerful auras at the same time. They are closing in from all directions. They are encircling the oasis.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" someone wondered.</p>

    <p>"Look!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao suddenly pointed at Qu Shuling and shouted.</p>

    <p>Just behind Qu Shuling's injured neck, the bruised area was actually emitting a gleaming light at this moment.</p>

    <p>Spiritual power engraving?</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone here understood.</p>

    <p>The spirit beast that knocked down Qu Shuling also added its own spiritual energy imprinted on it at the moment it hit Qu Shuling! It accurately positioned the location where Qu Shuling was knocked down!</p>

    <p>And now those spiritual beasts are rioting. They are all following the tracks engraved by their spiritual power and are heading towards the oasis to outflank them!</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why is it different from the inference we agreed on before?" Zhang Linyan was a little confused. She felt that the current test content seemed to have fundamentally changed.</p>

    <p>But I can't figure out where the problem lies.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered her head and thought. She was thinking of a solution. But then she suddenly heard Ma Jiao stand up and yell: "The soldiers are coming to stop us. The water is coming to cover us. We have to find a way to fight! Where are the Gray Cult believers!"</p>

    <p>"We are here!"</p>

    <p>"We are here!"</p>

    <p>"We are here!"</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. High school cultivators from various countries responded in unison in their own languages.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was completely shocked now.</p>

    <p>It turns out that except for the tenth group of people from the Huaxiu Kingdom who just entered the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>There are so many high school students left. All of them are Gray Cult members!</p>

    <p>And Ma Jiao, the deputy director of the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch, has suddenly become the temporary boss here...</p>
