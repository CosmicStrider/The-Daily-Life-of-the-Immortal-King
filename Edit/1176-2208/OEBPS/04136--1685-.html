  <h1>Chapter 1685 The helmsman of the universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As an eternal level existence, he has no intention of controlling the divine brain of the universe. He has a kind of strategizing and demeanor as if he has everything under control.</p>

    <p>From the eternity of time to the present, he has seen too many incredible cosmic epics. He has seen all kinds of scenes, big and small. He has also encountered all kinds of peerless masters and geniuses.</p>

    <p>Throughout the ages, some cultivators have only practiced Taoism for more than a hundred years, but they can compete with old monsters who have practiced for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>This is a genius.</p>

    <p>And these geniuses were later killed by him and made into specimens.</p>

    <p>Therefore, collecting specimens of these "geniuses" has become a small hobby that is unintentionally hidden.</p>

    <p>But now, a baby girl who knows the Dao has appeared in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>This long-lost "hobby" has now been revitalized at this very moment.</p>

    <p>A baby who knows how to use the Dao from birth?</p>

    <p>This shocked Wu Xin's heart to the extreme. He was filled with excitement, as if he had already seen Wang Nuan being made into a perfect specimen by himself.</p>

    <p>This is no longer a genius.</p>

    <p>Rather, it was an eternal genius that had never appeared before since eternity. And he had never had the experience of making a specimen of such an eternal genius.</p>

    <p>The strong special collection habit in his heart made Wu Xin become crazy again at this moment. Even though he didn't say a word and remained calm, the terrifying aura released from his body already made people shiver.</p>

    <p>"Wu Xin. Your thoughts are very dangerous. You have no idea what you are facing." Monk Jin Deng, as one of the eternal people who knew Wu Xin well, admonished him at this time.</p>

    <p>There was no need to read minds at all. He just glanced at the unintentional look in his eyes and the aura that kept rising from his body. Monk Jin Deng knew that this person's specimen collecting habit had occurred again.</p>

    <p>Back then, because of this hobby, he had unintentionally offended many people. So whenever he took a fancy to a genius and wanted to use it as a specimen, he would be fully prepared for battle. He would also take the genius's clan with him. Wipe them all out to prevent their descendants from coming to seek revenge.</p>

    <p>Now, eons of time have passed.</p>

    <p>At this moment when he accidentally saw Wang Nuan, Jin Deng didn't expect that his past eccentric habits would be brought back again.</p>

    <p>It's just that this time seems different from the eternal times.</p>

    <p>That is, compared to Wang Nuan, the combat power of those geniuses from Eternal Times is simply not on the same level.</p>

    <p>What's more, behind Wang Nuan stands that terrifying man...</p>

    <p>But obviously, Wu Xin didn't consider that much.</p>

    <p>His eyes were intense. The next second, he directly chose to attack Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>The sudden killing intent was astonishing.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the earth of the supreme world trembled, and streaks of golden light erupted. An exquisite half-length ancient god with eight sides and eight arms appeared out of thin air, wearing a golden armor.</p>

    <p>One of his arms held a blue-grey ancient sword. He only raised his arm and waved. The powerful sword energy passed across the battlefield, dividing the battlefield between Wu Xin and the Office of Strategic Deception, leaving a deep ravine. At the same time, it also An unintentional palm strike resolved it.</p>

    <p>This is Xiang Yi's unique eight-armed ancient god. He attracted everyone's attention as soon as he appeared. The magic rings flowing all over his body are filled with an aura of immortality.</p>

    <p>Wu Xin raised his eyebrows and stared at the eight-armed ancient god. He was surprised to find that this was an existence he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>This eight-armed ancient god from a foreign land has an otherworldly feeling about him. When he appears, there is a surge of golden light and purple light. It seems to be straight into the underworld. It is very extraordinary and carries great pressure.</p>

    <p>"Huangquan Dao of Chaos...I see..." Wu Xin observed for a long time. Suddenly he realized what the origin of this eight-armed ancient god was.</p>

    <p>This is the power of Huangquan's chaotic path!</p>

    <p>It was a Tao method that was naturally understood by a genius who was made a specimen by him.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that this sect should have become extinct. It will never appear again.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, that man found his successor before he died...</p>

    <p>No wonder he didn't find any memory of this method in the young man's body when he wanted to steal it.</p>

    <p>"interesting."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wu Xin spoke lightly.</p>

    <p>His eyes were piercing, with a murderous intent.</p>

    <p>A baby girl who knows how to use the Dao not long after she is born...</p>

    <p>The only koi in the world of cultivation that integrates luck...</p>

    <p>And this. The man who inherited the chaotic orthodoxy of Huang Quan...</p>

    <p>These are all perfect objects that he can use to make specimens.</p>

    <p>"All of you here will become my collection today."</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The strong oppressive force of the divine brain was continuously released outwards with Wu Xin as the center of the brainwave waves. Everyone in the venue felt the blood surge.</p>

    <p>How powerful is the 100% activated divine brain? Even though Monk Jin Deng told everyone about it from the beginning, it was only at this moment that everyone truly understood this powerful sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi. They secretly exclaimed at the same time.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Ling Zhenren is indeed a powerful enemy in this world...</p>

    <p>This level can only be encountered in the universe of Wang Ling. It is almost a monster BOSS.</p>

    <p>They are now at the top of their respective worlds. The strongest enemy they have ever encountered is not even one percent as strong as Wu Xin...</p>

    <p>"Is this the Eternal One..." At this time, the two of them were in a trance. They both felt it was too scary.</p>

    <p>Even though Xiang Yi sacrificed this eight-armed ancient god and used his own abilities to withstand extreme pressure, this ancient god who could dominate the world in his original world made him feel fragile when facing the eternal being in front of him. is like a piece of paper.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, be careful. The Eternal One is about to take action."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said with a pale face.</p>

    <p>As a being who has just been bathed in chaos and transformed from chaos into a divine beast, it is self-evident that he is sensitive to the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wu Xin is just standing there. The chaotic energy surging on his body seems to Er Ha to be even more terrifying than the original Chaos Tribulation!</p>

    <p>An immortal stand between the Immortal and the Office of Strategic Deception is about to begin at this very moment!</p>

    <p>If Wu Xin cannot be stopped in this supreme world, then the entire universe will probably face a catastrophe.</p>

    <p>For this maniac who has a special collection of specimens, not only those geniuses can be made into specimens. All the strange creatures and planets in the world...as long as he likes them can be made into specimens. Bring it to your collection.</p>

    <p>"You know nothing about power. Just do some useless work." At this time, an unintentional voice came from the minds of everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>It was just a light word. But it contained a terrifying change. It seemed like it could reach eternity.</p>

    <p>Behind him, there are all kinds of bright lights superimposing and releasing. There are countless dark black ties connecting behind him. Then they converge into a huge purple gold rudder in front of him.</p>

    <p>"I want to show you... who is the helmsman of the universe." Wu Xin said.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand and touched the rudder of the ship. He turned it slightly. The void behind him was instantly annihilated. It was blurry. It seemed that there were countless causes and effects, and the laws were all broken by this turn!</p>

    <p>This feeling of oppression is terrifying.</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception is under tremendous pressure.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Lord Diulei, and Er Ha were all shaken by this huge force and vomited blood.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhou Ziyi, who was wearing multiple layers of thermal underwear, was trembling a little after being shot out like a bullet...</p>

    <p>But in the audience, only he and Wang Nuan were unscathed...</p>
