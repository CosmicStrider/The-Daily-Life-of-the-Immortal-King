  <h1>Chapter 2085 Zhang Zhui takes action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Giant Shark King. With just one roll, he smashed several ships with his own spiritual power. The monks on board were all blown to pieces in an instant.</p>

    <p>This kind of ability far exceeds Venerated Immortal. It is not something that the monks from all over the world can compete with.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan had never revealed his true ability before. Now Wang Muyu's judgment based on the actual situation at hand is just his own personal guess.</p>

    <p>This ability is similar to the "Great Enlightenment Technique" in Heavenly Dao, but it is fundamentally different. It directly allows this giant shark king to surpass its own genes on the original basis. Now it is a fusion of dragon blood. It is an alien monster with extraordinary abilities. No ordinary spiritual beast on earth can match it.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu knew it very well, because Qiao Yanyuan's Yueguang was deep in the restricted area of the sea. It was a base on the earth specially chosen by Honghuang.</p>

    <p>But who could have imagined that this base quietly placed on the earth would be attacked by a group of cultivation ships from various countries. Monks from various countries gathered here and fished here in a lively manner. This pair of Qiao Yanyuan came to Said it hurt.</p>

    <p>Honghuang has not yet developed. As the latest helmsman who took over Mingyue Ye's role in Honghuang, and at the same time Bai Zhe's most trusted subordinate, Qiao Yanyuan's ruthlessness is evident.</p>

    <p>If he does it more secretly, he can create many mysterious events to create panic. He can also make this group of monks retreat in the face of difficulties.</p>

    <p>But he did not choose to do this. Instead, he directly used some of his own power to arrange such a giant shark king to directly start attacking and killing.</p>

    <p>Venerated Immortal, Sage Immortal...</p>

    <p>After the Venerable Realm is the Holy Realm. And after the Holy Realm is the "Dao Realm." That is, Dao Immortal, Dao Supreme, Dao God.</p>

    <p>Starting from the Dao Ancestor realm after Dao God, it is the "ancestral realm."</p>

    <p>The shark king in front of him is at least a Taoist creature. It is definitely not something that his teacher, Sword Master, can handle.</p>

    <p>Not to mention now. His teacher is blocking the enemy while still trying to save people as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was extremely worried. He and the Sword Master had known each other for a long time, but the relationship between master and disciple only lasted for more than half a day.</p>

    <p>But sometimes I have to admit that a person's personality charm is really the key to making people quickly change their minds.</p>

    <p>"The teacher is in danger!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was anxious and wanted to take action directly.</p>

    <p>Brush!</p>

    <p>Someone blocked his way. He stared at Wang Muyu and said, "Don't touch Muyu yet. Leave this matter to me first."</p>

    <p>The person speaking is Zhang Zhui. He is just a creature in the Tao realm. He is an eternal being and can still kill indiscriminately.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is not appropriate for Wang Muyu to expose himself in public at this time. Monks from all over the world are here. If he takes action, everyone will be able to see his appearance. It will not be clear at that time.</p>

    <p>And Zhang Zhui's instinct told him that this was to lure the tiger away from the mountain.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe probably didn't give up on capturing Wang Muyu, so he had to guard against it. So he chose to go out alone to rescue the siege. In addition, Yue Lingwei was left in the little white dragon to accompany Wang Muyu, and he was still in a comatose state. The two Ouyang brothers.</p>

    <p>After seeing Wang Muyu worried about the Sword Master, Zhang Zhui stopped the little guy directly and curled his lips.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, his appearance is radiant. The smile still shows the shadow of his youth. He is arrogant and domineering: "As long as I am here, it is not your turn to take action. Your teacher paid for it." Yes. At this moment, I am the bodyguard you hired."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he turned into a stream of light and came out of Xiaobailong's skylight.</p>

    <p>Although the Sword Master had long known that Zhang Zhui was no ordinary person, this sudden burst of spiritual power still surprised him.</p>

    <p>Zhang Xi turned into a stream of light and was seen running around in the field. Yi Jianchuan could not see his figure at all.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Zhang Zhui's speed is too fast. Everything around him is moving at such a high speed. Everything he sees seems to be slowed down.</p>

    <p>Those monks who were in panic or about to be beaten to pieces by the shark king's fins were all rescued by Zhang Zhui in an instant.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that this eternal thief deserves to be the eternal thief. Wang Muyu also discovered. It turns out that Zhang Zhui's specialty is not "stealing." It is purely based on speed!</p>

    <p>Not only is his hand speed fast, but his movement speed is also quite amazing.</p>

    <p>He rescued the monks on the ship who were about to be crushed into ashes one by one, and then suddenly threw them far away to a safe position in the rear.</p>

    <p>In less than a second, Zhang Zhui had rescued more than a hundred people.</p>

    <p>Those who were rescued didn't even know what was happening. They were picked up by their collars by Zhang Zhui. They were snatched away as if they were carrying chickens. Then they transformed into human cannonballs and were ejected to a safe area by Zhang Zhui. It landed in a parabola. It hit the sea in the distance and caused a huge splash.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan noticed that Zhang Zhui threw these monks directly towards the entrance of the sea restricted area that was smashed by the male cultivators. And the distance was extremely far.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I can't just throw it back to the entrance and leave the restricted area directly...</p>

    <p>Saved everyone. It took less than three seconds in total.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that some of them were smashed to pieces by the sudden giant shark king before Zhang Zhui could take action. They were completely destroyed, and they couldn't even be saved.</p>

    <p>"Who is this fellow Taoist?" In the void, Yi Jianchuan stood with his hands behind his back and stared at Zhang Zhui. He had never heard of such a person. But Zhang Zhui spoke Mandarin very well, allowing him to speak 100% It is asserted that this is a person with Huaxiu bloodline.</p>

    <p>"Hey. In this case, don't worry about who I am. The person has been rescued. This thing needs to be dealt with now." Zhang Zhui waved his hand and did not directly answer the sword master's words.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu bloodline?</p>

    <p>That's not...</p>

    <p>If this were calculated based on seniority, there is no guarantee that some of the monks on the earth today are his descendants.</p>

    <p>After all, when he was young, Zhang Zhui was a romantic. He was the eternal thief and the eternal lover. According to modern terms, he was the King of the Sea.</p>

    <p>But in the Eternal Period, the society at that time was relatively feudal. It was not as good as the modern society of scientific cultivation and rule of law. It was normal for men to have three wives and four concubines.</p>

    <p>As for Zhang Zhui, his concept is different. Anyway, according to his own description at the time, he is an honest gardener. He has no other hobbies. He just likes to sow seeds.</p>

    <p>But facing the Sword Master, it was hard for him to tell me directly that I might be an ancestor.</p>

    <p>So I had no choice but to fool around with it.</p>

    <p>Turn all your attention to the giant shark king in front of you.</p>

    <p>I saw him. Rolling up one sleeve, his hands turned into eagle claws, and he directly reached down from the void. In an understatement, the thick fins were torn open by his hands.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>He could feel how powerful this monster was.</p>

    <p>But even so, this terrifying monster is as brittle as a piece of paper in Zhang Zhui's hands...</p>
