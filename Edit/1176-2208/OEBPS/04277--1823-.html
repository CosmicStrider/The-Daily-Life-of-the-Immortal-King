  <h1>Chapter 1823 Shuffle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything was within the layout and arrangements of Wang Ling. Being suppressed by Wang Muyu, Jiuyun quickly began to ask for help in the name of the leader of the second group of the Heavenly Dao Alliance.</p>

    <p>It's no wonder that he dares to come here to help Jiuyun at this time. He is nothing more than a collector of those with royal bloodline. That is, the holy clan headed by the holy king.</p>

    <p>However, neither the Heavenly Dao Alliance nor Jiuyun has the right to talk directly to the Saints. Therefore, they can only entrust an organization designated by the Saints to convey the message on their behalf.</p>

    <p>And this organization is the Tengu.</p>

    <p>But what Jiuyun didn't expect was that the current actual control of Tengu was also in the hands of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because Levis has become the new Grand Pope. And the Grand Pope himself is also an Eight-Star Tengu among the Tengu. He has the absolute right to speak in the Tengu organization. He also has the right to dialogue with the Saints.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Levis received a signal for help from Jiuyun, he, now transformed into the Arch Pope, was not in a hurry to send reinforcements.</p>

    <p>He hated the Heavenly Dao Alliance and wanted to teach the Heavenly Dao Alliance a lesson from a very early stage. Therefore, he temporarily put aside Jiuyun's request for help and tried to make Jiuyun endure a little more confrontation with Wang Muyu. The mental pressure and suffering of being on the line.</p>

    <p>There is nothing happier than watching someone put on a mask of pain.</p>

    <p>Of course, at the same moment, there were Pei Luoqi and Meiko Asi standing in front of him.</p>

    <p>The two people stood in front of him respectfully. They kept their eyes closed and lowered their heads. They did not dare to look directly into his eyes. They were as good as two grandchildren. They did not dare to speak at all...</p>

    <p>Previously, in order to shift the blame, the two of them passed the death of the Arch Pope onto someone else. As a result, the uncle of Yuan Zun actually appeared in front of them without any problems. This surprised the two of them.</p>

    <p>After ruling out the possibility of a fake corpse, the two of them began to secretly use their own methods to verify the authenticity of the Arch Pope in a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>The Arch Pope's realm strength itself is not strong. Therefore, for the two people who have entered the Venerated Immortal realm, there are countless ways to verify the true identity of the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>They originally thought that the Arch Pope must be someone else pretending to be him. Therefore, they tried to expose the Arch Pope's mask with full confidence.</p>

    <p>Levis naturally knew what the two of them were thinking, and deliberately walked down to warm them up for a while, giving them a chance to test them personally.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Nuan's "Shadow Film Assimilation Technique" is too perfect. It is impossible to break it with just the strength of the two of them.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be the real Pope..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Pei Luoqi and Maiko Assi shed cold sweat at the same time.</p>

    <p>The two of them had a guilty conscience. They thought about all the possibilities. But they never thought that the Arch Pope would actually come back to life.</p>

    <p>Seeing the slightly panicked expressions on their faces, Levis knew that the time had come.</p>

    <p>He raised the corners of his lips and said completely following the tone of the Arch Pope: "I know. You two have always had issues with me."</p>

    <p>"No... no. The two of us are loyal to the church. How could we have any objections to the big brother?" Pei Luoqi quickly bowed and said. He used the word "big brother." This was usually when no one was around. Pei Luoqi's special name for the Arch Pope. It shows the unusual relationship between the other Arch Popes.</p>

    <p>When Maiko Assi heard that Pei Luoqi was trying to get closer, he was naturally not to be outdone. He also hurriedly defended himself and said: "I don't know where the Arch Pope heard the news. Both of us have deep respect for the Arch Pope. And I respect the Arch Pope." The respect of the Arch Pope is definitely higher than that of Team Leader Pei."</p>

    <p>When Pei Luoqi heard this, he twitched the corner of his mouth and said, "General, what do you mean? You mean that I don't respect the Pope as much as you do? Over the years, our Heavenly Dao Alliance has served the church, mediating the conflicts between the various forces. From life to death. Among them, there are also times I have helped the general to settle a lot of things for you. These things... has the Arch Pope forgotten all of them?"</p>

    <p>When Levi heard this, he didn't speak in a hurry. He tried his best to control his emotions and suppressed his laughter with his usual professionalism. He watched the two people in the audience start to argue with each other.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi: "Your Heavenly Dao Alliance is just a peaceful organization. Can this be used to brag? If it weren't for the support of the Arch Pope. Look at how many forces are willing to give you such a reputation as the Heavenly Dao Alliance."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi: "I wonder if the general would dare to say this to the leader of our Heavenly Dao Alliance?"</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi chuckled: "Why don't you dare to do this?"</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi: "Our Heavenly Dao Alliance serves the church. If you hurt the heart of the leader of our Heavenly Dao Alliance, you will break the heart of the church. It will also break the heart of the Arch Pope. You said you respect the Arch Pope before, but I feel that you don't take the Arch Pope seriously at all. Unlike me, I only feel sorry for the Archbishop!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Realizing that the topic was gradually going off track, Levis quickly cleared his throat and directed the topic to the track that Wang Ling wanted to arrange: "You two, there is no need to argue anymore. I know. You two treat me the same way. A loyal person."</p>

    <p>He stood up. He held the cane that symbolized the power of the Arch Pope. He said leisurely: "I called you two here. It's not to ask for punishment. The main thing is to remind you two not to fall into the trap."</p>

    <p>"A trap? I wonder what the Arch Pope meant?" Pei Luoqi said.</p>

    <p>"You two are having a huge quarrel here. Who is the biggest beneficiary?" Levis asked.</p>

    <p>Beneficiary?</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi frowned.</p>

    <p>The people related to this matter. One is Lawen. And the other is Levis.</p>

    <p>Although Levis was rescued by the Office of Strategic Deception, no trace has been found yet. However, I think it is also known that there is no direct connection between the victimized president of the Chilan Society and the beneficiary.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after Levis, who was pretending to be the Arch Pope, said these words, Pei Luoqi and Maiko Assi suddenly realized it almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Two words popped into my mind at the same time!</p>

    <p>--Lawen!</p>

    <p>This woman with deep connections has been developing in the city of Glio these years, recruiting soldiers privately in the name of a variety show producer.</p>

    <p>If there is a conflict between the two of them, the biggest beneficiary will naturally be Lawen.</p>

    <p>"I knew this woman would be difficult to deal with."</p>

    <p>"That's it! Brother Dajiao is deliberately reminding us not to fight internally, but to point the finger at the outside world!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Maiko Assi and Pei Luoqi expressed their opinions one after another.</p>

    <p>In fact, they don't have any substantive objections to Lawen. After all, Lawen only develops in the city of Glio. In fact, it does not threaten the Heavenly Dao Alliance and the nationwide army of Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>However, now because of their modesty, the two of them tried their best to show their loyalty to the church.</p>

    <p>So Lawen became the common target of the conflict between the two of them.</p>

    <p>"So... kill her."</p>

    <p>Levis knew that the time was now ripe. He used the body of this Arch Pope to give orders to Maiko Assi and Pei Luoqi.</p>
