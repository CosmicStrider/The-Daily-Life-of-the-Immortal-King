  <h1>Chapter 1627 Thunder is coming!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sirens of the ambulance kept coming. When Jiang Xiaoche woke up, he was already on his way to the hospital.</p>

    <p>His injuries were quite serious.</p>

    <p>When the slime man's flying legs hit him, he could clearly hear the sound of his ribs breaking.</p>

    <p>This damn thing... even his mother has never hit him since he was a child!</p>

    <p>Damn it! I wish you no descendants!</p>

    <p>When Jiang Xiaoche gradually regained consciousness, this was the first thing that came to his mind.</p>

    <p>Then he opened his eyes suddenly. As if he was awakened: "Miss Sun Rong... Miss was taken away by them!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jiang, please don't get excited. The police are already dealing with it," a female nurse said.</p>

    <p>"This road is so remote. How did you find me?" Jiang Xiaoche asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Someone called the police."</p>

    <p>"who?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know. But it sounds like a boy's voice."</p>

    <p>"Young man?" Jiang Xiaoche was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the study room of the Wang family's small villa. Wang Ling is completing today's homework.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong was hijacked, he had actually sensed it.</p>

    <p>Although with Sun Rong's current strength and the fact that Sun Ying'er is with him, he doesn't need to worry about the girl's safety.</p>

    <p>But in the end he called the police.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong has lurked in.</p>

    <p>His call to the police can be said to have affected the whole body.</p>

    <p>Once the power of the government gets involved in this matter, it will form a trap for Liu Renfeng's underground scientific research team.</p>

    <p>This is the first reason why Wang Ling calls the police.</p>

    <p>And the second reason is that he is going to help the mahjong trio in Songhai City Number 1 Prison find new inmates.</p>

    <p>One of these four has been missing for a long time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it's time to arrange for the new couple to move in with their bags.</p>

    <p>As for Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>This is just a casual rescue by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He doesn't like this person.</p>

    <p>But after all, Jiang Xiaoche now serves Sun Rong. The driver's life is also his life.</p>

    <p>Now. As for other things, Wang Ling actually doesn't need to be taken care of at all.</p>

    <p>He thinks Sun Rong will be fine.</p>

    <p>It's just a Liu Renfeng. It's not yet time for him to take action.</p>

    <p>So he settled his thoughts and planned to complete the set of exercises in front of him seriously. The monthly exam was coming soon, and it was time to calculate and score points once a month.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling found that he had written only a few words, and his thoughts began to wander.</p>

    <p>It's not that I feel irritable, depressed or uneasy. It's just that this feeling comes from a bit inexplicable.</p>

    <p>Because of Talisman, he became an emotionless piece of wood in everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>Even now. Wang Ling still doesn't feel any emotions.</p>

    <p>It's just that the brain will go blank for some reason.</p>

    <p>It was as if something was suppressing him.</p>

    <p>The pen in his hand stopped. Wang Ling felt that his homework status today was inexplicably sluggish.</p>

    <p>On the bed, Wang Ying rested her head with one hand and fell asleep. She quietly opened her left eye a crack and looked at Wang Ling: "I'm really worried. Just go and see for yourself."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling was muttering in his heart. He couldn't help but think to himself, why don't you go?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said this without saying anything. The main reason was that Wang Ying's brain circuit was connected to him. He could hear it anyway.</p>

    <p>I saw the man on the bed leisurely crossing his legs. He said with a leisurely expression: "Have you ever seen a wife castrate her husband? She actually wanted to castrate me... Who gave her the courage? I'm here now Figure out how to torment her at night. I'm too lazy to do it until I think about it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Wang Ying knew everything.</p>

    <p>This is not surprising.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Ying'er's Shadow ability can still be used normally.</p>

    <p>But after all, Wang Ying is the first to win the first prize.</p>

    <p>Especially these days at home. Ever since Er Ha started helping Wang Nuan change diapers, Wang Ying has also started to learn how to coax Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>This time it was familiar. Ah Nuan girl naturally had a good impression of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Then Shadow's authority. Naturally, Wang Ying's authority is one level higher than that of Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>It is said that the first level of officialdom crushes people to death. This is probably what it means...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, I didn't see that Wang Ying was the type of person who could bear to take care of children.</p>

    <p>He calls this early adaptation.</p>

    <p>He said that if he and Sun Ying'er had a relationship in the future, he wouldn't have to worry about learning anymore. He would be able to get started directly.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Wang Ling was dumbfounded on the spot.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Wang Ying is indeed prepared for a rainy day...</p>

    <p>The girl hasn't agreed yet. Even my wife started to scream.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He is obviously such a low-key person. How could he appear so shameless?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was captured because Wang Ling helped report it to the police.</p>

    <p>This matter soon alerted the Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>This was obviously not an ordinary kidnapping case. The local Cultivation Police Department was afraid that it would be difficult to deal with it. So when Boss Sun heard about it, he made an urgent phone call to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In fact, the Office of Strategic Deception had already taken action before Boss Sun called.</p>

    <p>However, this process is actually against the rules. Therefore, Huaxiu Alliance still needs to report what should be reported.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren! I only have this granddaughter... I can't let anything happen to her." On the phone. Lord Diulei heard Sun Yiyuan's sobs for the first time.</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the old man currently knows nothing about the strength of his precious granddaughter.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a rush.</p>

    <p>Once the strength of Sun Rong is exposed, it will directly affect Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That's why it's a top secret at the heart of the Office of Strategic Deception. Not even Boss Sun can be trusted to keep him in the loop at the moment.</p>

    <p>Because even if you say it, you may not believe it.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that a girl who was only in the Foundation Building stage could reach the level of fighting against Dao God in just a few days...</p>

    <p>In order to appease the old man, Lord Diulei could only say over the phone: "Don't worry, Mr. Sun. Sun Rong's business is my business. I, of the Office of Strategic Deception, will definitely gather all the strength of the clan to rescue Miss Sun Rong. Meanwhile, in order to prevent accidents. We have a full medical team here. I promise you, Mr. Sun. We will bring Miss Sun Rong back safely without a single hair on her head broken."</p>

    <p>"Thank you all..." Boss Sun's voice trembled. Then he pressed the phone.</p>

    <p>"It's really urgent." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Sect Master, what should we do now?" Zhuo Yi asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"Even if Sun Rong girl has fighting power, if we don't move, I'm afraid it will still arouse suspicion. So, we have no choice but to take action." Lord Diulei said: "And the bigger the momentum, the better."</p>

    <p>"Gather the power of the whole sect?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head.</p>

    <p>Today's Office of Strategic Deception is not what it used to be. There are allies in the world of cultivation all over the world.</p>

    <p>This is Lord Diulei's preliminary layout of the blueprint for the Great Alliance of External Cultivators.</p>

    <p>When the Allied Intelligence Network and various resources of the Office of Strategic Deception around the world are connected in series.</p>

    <p>No matter how deeply this Liu Renfeng team hides, it will be exposed to the broad daylight in an instant...</p>

    <p>"It's not about gathering the strength of the whole sect."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Lord Diulei said seriously: "It is about gathering the power of the world."</p>

    <p>"Global power..."Zhuo Yi looked horrified.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Global power." Lord Diulei said, "I think that's why your elder brother called the police. To get the authorities involved and make the situation bigger. It's all about the momentum we create. It can completely scare off those lawbreakers who are plotting against Miss Sun behind her back. It'll serve as a warning to the others."</p>

    <p>"So this is what Master means!" Zhuo Yi suddenly realized. They clasped their fists and said, "As expected of the True Lord. Zhuo Yi has learned the lesson!"</p>

    <p>"It's easy to talk about."</p>

    <p>In front of the Office of Strategic Deception True Venerated Immortal hall. Lord Diulei flicked his sleeves confidently: "Come! Issue the Sect Master's Order!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the distance. Facing Lord Diulei's big move. Wang Ling looked stunned.</p>

    <p>He just called the police...</p>
