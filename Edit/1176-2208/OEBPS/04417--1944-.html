  <h1>Chapter 1944 Protect Our SideWang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Teng Luchen came with bad intentions and was extremely difficult to deal with. Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi were naturally extremely vigilant about this.</p>

    <p>"The video and audio recording have been processed. It's seamless. They were quite cautious. They only sent Dean Jing Heqiu to get the information. They didn't deal with other people. But it was useless. I could still hack in." Encrypted chat room. Wang Ming is making a video call with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He calculated that Teng Luchen would definitely look at the video data of an internal test in the spirit world. So he hacked into the system in advance and tampered with it.</p>

    <p>The so-called tampering is nothing more than the art of editing. As long as the editing is smooth enough, almost no flaws will be found.</p>

    <p>Of course, in order to make the tampered video more realistic, Wang Ming also used some three-dimensional animation effects.</p>

    <p>He stayed up late at night to model the characters. Even the pores were 100% restored, ensuring accuracy. Even if you look carefully, you can't see any flaws.</p>

    <p>But Teng Luchen was really scary. For the first time, Wang Ming felt that even if he handled it perfectly, the other party would still notice clues.</p>

    <p>"The opponent this time is indeed different from the past. And I don't know why I have an intuition. I feel that this old man seems to know the master. Not only has he met the master, but he has also secretly observed him for a long time." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"So this is the intuition of a peeping tom?" Wang Ming hehehe.</p>

    <p>If you want to calculate carefully, in fact, Zhuo Yi also witnessed Wang Ling defeat Tuntian Ha. They secretly observed and tracked him for a long time. Finally, he shamelessly accepted Wang Ling's disciples.</p>

    <p>They are all people who like to observe in secret. Then Zhuo Yi must be aware of Teng Luchen.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi coughed twice and said awkwardly: "Teacher Ming is so absolute. Although I am a voyeur, I am also a righteous voyeur. And I don't voyeur now. I am aboveboard. Follow my master and do great things!"</p>

    <p>"It's definitely not going to work like this anyway. You and I both have to think of a way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "And you have felt it, too. I feel like there is an undercover agent around Ling Ling."</p>

    <p>"Yes. I do feel this way. But now the master is in the first and third grade of high school. He is surrounded by his own people. The master's wife is so guarded. Who can get the master's information." Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming lowered his head and thought for a moment. Then he sighed: "This matter must be investigated as soon as possible. Zhenjun and I have also talked about this matter before. He said that he would be responsible for handling it. We will quietly wait for the result. Bar..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying went to school earlier than usual this morning. He arrived at school half an hour earlier. Except for Guo Hao and Chen Chao, who were busy doing homework, there was no one else in the classroom.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying breathed a sigh of relief. These two people had no time to care about her at the moment, so she didn't need to worry about it at all.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why she felt extra nervous this morning. She didn't know if it was because she collected the six small cans of tea from Teng Lao. For the first time, Jiang Yingying felt like she was carrying a "huge amount of cash" on her body.</p>

    <p>A small can of tea can be sold for 100,000 immortal gold... According to the current housing prices, if she sold all six cans, it would be enough to buy her own small villa in the suburbs.</p>

    <p>This feeling of suddenly becoming a rich woman made Jiang Yingying extremely excited.</p>

    <p>According to the current cost-effective ratio between immortal gold and Huaxiu national currency, 100,000 immortal gold can be exchanged for 1 million Huaxiu national currency.</p>

    <p>When he came to the desk, Jiang Yingying kept staring at the desk behind Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>When she first transferred to Number 60 High School, she wanted to sit behind Wang Ling. However, Teacher Pan told her that the desks were high-end desks and that she needed to pay additional membership fees.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, she really didn't have any money at that time. She couldn't sit behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now. Things are different now!</p>

    <p>She Jiang Yingying. is also rich!</p>

    <p>As long as she sells a small pot of tea, she has enough capital to occupy the throne of the beautiful desk behind Wang Ling for three years in high school!</p>

    <p>Taking a few deep breaths, Jiang Yingying felt that her mood had calmed down a lot.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Guo Hao and Chen Chao also finished their work. The two of them looked at Jiang Yingying, who had arrived half an hour earlier than usual, with relaxed expressions, and the slightly raised corners of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Finally, Chen Chao couldn't help but asked: "What's the matter, Jiang Yingying? Are you so happy? Did you win the lottery? Or did you meet a senior on the way to school and give you some kind of opportunity?"</p>

    <p>The communication between Jiang Yingying and Chen Chao hasn't been that much since they transferred to school. It can't be said that she is too familiar with Chen Chao. But she has seen Chen Chao open his mouth many times.</p>

    <p>Now this opening directly hit her heart. Her calm mood became tense again.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Jiang Yingying feels that Chen Chao is the scariest person in Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>"No... nothing... I'm just thinking about the spirit world test. Hey, if my grades are better, I might be qualified to go," Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>In fact, regarding the last monthly exam, she also deliberately lowered her score.</p>

    <p>She learned about the spiritual world test and the Earth Center Project from Teng Luchen in advance. If she did well in the test, she would be selected. And if she was selected, she would definitely participate in a series of official training programs. This would not be conducive to her collecting information in school. Intelligence work.</p>

    <p>"Hey. That's it."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao looked at each other and laughed at the same time: "I heard that Lingzi also went in last night. And he was the first batch to go in. Still with Qu Shuling!"</p>

    <p>"Well. I know about this too. What do you think?" Jiang Yingying followed the conversation. She thought this was a good opportunity to collect information.</p>

    <p>"How else can we look at it? Some people on the Internet said that he used a primer to stick to Li Changzhe from Beijing. Good luck." Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"Is it just luck?" Jiang Yingying looked suspicious.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's good luck. You're new here not long ago. We've both been with Lingzi for a long time. His luck has always been so good. Otherwise, would he be elected as the mascot of our class?" Guo Hao laughed. He stood up. He smiled and touched his round head. His voice was magical and brilliant.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Jiang Yingying feels that there is something wrong in it.</p>

    <p>How lucky can a person be to lead Number 60 High School to victory every time he participates in a competition?</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiang Yingying was dubious about Teng Lao's suspicion at the beginning. But now that she has been in contact with Teng Luchen for a long time, she also began to have some doubts about Wang Ling's true strength.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It would be nice if I knew Wang Ling better." Jiang Yingying sighed in her heart. She looked at the beautiful desk behind Wang Ling and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>As long as she sells the small can of tea after school today, she can get closer to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Jiang Yingying suddenly heard Guo Hao say to Chen Chao: "Awesome. Did you know that the beautiful desk behind Wang Ling was bought by someone! I don't know who it is. So. Rich!"</p>

    <p>"Bought by...?" Jiang Yingying was shocked. He stood up from the desk and looked at Chen Chao and Guo Hao in shock.</p>
