  <h1>Chapter 2025: Immortal. My level is low. Don't lie to me.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Seeing the energy of the submarine instantly increase to full capacity, Mr. Zanghu felt relieved: "As expected of the Sun family in charge of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Even the submarine sealed in Jinwanli There are ample energy reserves."</p>

    <p>"This... this is natural. Our Sun family has always been cautious." Sun Rong said with a slight smile.</p>

    <p>She looked at Mr. Zanghu's thumbs up. She quickly straightened her head and stared at the screen in front of her.</p>

    <p>Because she also knows very well. Where does the energy supply on this submarine come from?</p>

    <p>It must be Wang Ling pulling out his hair to use as energy source again.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Mr. Zanghu was not unfaithful in his praise. Sun Rong actually felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"How's it going? Miss Sun. Is the operation still stable?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya and Wang Ling came from behind and asked about the situation.</p>

    <p>"The submarine has been successfully launched. It is currently using radar signals to find the location of the spirit whale group according to Mr. Zanghu's instructions." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Under the deep sea, there are unknowns, so be careful." Immortal Toya reminded.</p>

    <p>The East Huaxiu Sea is very vast. There may be countless dangers lurking in the deep sea especially. If the spirit whale that can change body size really survives from prehistory to the present, then its intelligence is naturally otherworldly. It is impossible for them to be allowed to do so easily. found.</p>

    <p>And for such a special spirit whale, its status in the whale circle is probably unimaginable. It is normal for other spirit whales to take cover to protect its safety.</p>

    <p>"The spirit whale is a particularly united underwater spirit beast."</p>

    <p>When the submarine descended to more than a thousand meters under the sea, the surrounding environment began to become dim. Mr. Zanghu stared at the picture in front of him that was returned by the intelligent sensing system on the screen. He said: "Although they are Normally, they are always alone. But that is just an illusion seen by cultivators on the sea. Once they enter the seabed, the spirit whales will unite together to defend themselves against foreign enemies."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Hidden Fox. The size of a spirit whale. There is also a nemesis at the bottom of the sea?"</p>

    <p>"Nowadays, human cultivators have analyzed the number of undersea spirit beasts. There are less than 20. Originally, the cultivation seas of various countries were full of mystery. Moreover, judging from the existing data, the size of adult spirit whales is by no means the largest in the East Huaxiu Sea. And the prehistoric spirit whale I am looking for, I think is a special case. It is of great research value."</p>

    <p>"What happens after Mr. Zanghu finds it?"</p>

    <p>"Of course we have to find ways to protect it. This is one of the rare big guys on earth who may have witnessed the rise and fall of human cultivators on earth. If it were to be exposed like this, I'm afraid it would lead to death. Although it is so close. Over the past few years, many people have been exploring the bottom of the East Huaxiu Sea just to find this big guy."</p>

    <p>As a rigorous science popularizer, Mr. Zanghu sighed: "A while ago, I deliberately released the news that there might be a giant beast bigger than the spirit whale under the sea..."</p>

    <p>"I know. Mr. Zanghu is talking about sea orangutans?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. That's just a spiritual beast I made up by using Internet public opinion in order to protect this big guy."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Wang Ling and Sun Rong raised their eyebrows at the same time. They all suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Recently, there have been endless rumors about the giant sea gorilla under the sea. Who would have thought that...it actually came from the arm of Mr. Tibetan Fox.</p>

    <p>However, Mr. Hidden Fox's original intention was to divert attention and protect the precious prehistoric spirit whale. In this case, this explanation is actually completely reasonable.</p>

    <p>Just as he was talking about this, the submarine, which had descended three thousand meters to the bottom of the sea, suddenly heard a loud noise from around it.</p>

    <p>A collision of unknown cause occurred!</p>

    <p>And the radar sensors around the submarine. No pre-collision response whatsoever!</p>

    <p>"It's strange. This sixth-generation collision warning system should be very advanced. How could you not notice it?" Mr. Zanghu frowned.</p>

    <p>Just when I was feeling strange, there was a huge tremor. Then a shocking scene immediately appeared.</p>

    <p>Just in front of the screen, a palm with a flashing blue aura appeared. It was obviously the palm of a primate. It was extremely huge, like a hill. Its five fingers were clasped together like a mountain. An iron pliers firmly grasped the iron skin of the submarine.</p>

    <p>Then. A huge purple pupil suddenly appeared in front of the screen!</p>

    <p>This terrifying giant underwater creature is grabbing the submarine with its own hands and staring at the giant iron fish it caught with its own pupils.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu was shocked: "This... this is not..."</p>

    <p>Sea gorilla!</p>

    <p>That's right!</p>

    <p>You can't go wrong...</p>

    <p>This furry palm. And this huge body! And the appearance of an orangutan scanned from the thermal device!</p>

    <p>Wipe!</p>

    <p>Is there anyone? Is there anyone?</p>

    <p>Why did a species he casually made up really appear on the bottom of the sea?</p>

    <p>Does this sea gorilla breathe with its lungs? Is it a serious primate? Why can it continue to move freely in the deep sea?</p>

    <p>Facing the spiritual beast that he had made up but actually appeared in front of him, Mr. Zanghu's expression was confused.</p>

    <p>However, something happened that made him even more confused.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the classmate Wang who was not very talkative and had been standing next to him suddenly took a step forward and drew a stroke in the void with his fingertips. In an instant, spiritual power boiled. A six-pointed star seal formation appeared deep in the seabed. It was engraved directly on the body of this sea gorilla.</p>

    <p>Arrangement in the air?</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu was confused. This should not be the strength that Foundation Building had during the period...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zanghu, don't panic. This is a task I assigned to my apprentice. In fact, I have already completed the arrangement of this magic circle. My apprentice is just finishing the work." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"Immortal. My level is low. Don't lie to me." Mr. Zanghu looked suspiciously.</p>

    <p>"How could I lie to you? I am also your fan."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He rarely lies, because he can't help but sweat when he lies. The six-pointed star array in front of him is a magic array that can be directly planted on the body of a spiritual beast for mind control.</p>

    <p>Creatures that only belong to Heavenly Dao. Dao Ancestor will be directly controlled by force. There is no reason at all.</p>

    <p>As for such a magic circle, Immortal Toya cannot achieve it by relying on his own power alone.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the orangutan holding the submarine gradually stabilized, Immortal Toya smiled happily. He patted Wang Ling on the shoulder: "Okay. It's under control. Thank you for your hard work, my... good disciple."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Although I can't tell what's strange specifically, Mr. Zanghu just feels like there's something weird about it.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling and Immortal Toya with suspicious eyes. However, his attention was quickly diverted by Sun Rong's next sentence: "By the way, senior. Didn't you mean sea gorilla?" Is it just a creature you made up? Why did this seabed suddenly appear..."</p>
