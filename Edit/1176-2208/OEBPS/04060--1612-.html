  <h1>Chapter 1612 Looking for the person who opened the door</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Today is actually the third anniversary of Shou Chong's "Infinite Energy Plan."</p>

    <p>Everything started when he picked up that black meteorite the size of a grain of sand...</p>

    <p>On that day, Shou Chong named the small meteorite: "Eternity."</p>

    <p>And to this day, all the efforts he has made are to develop unlimited energy and become the greatest scientist in the entire earth! Even in the history of cultivation!</p>

    <p>Since the last time Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi raised 20 billion in R&amp;D funds because of their mutual rivalry, Shou Chong has updated the equipment in his underground laboratory and strengthened his goals.</p>

    <p>But now, his research and development has encountered a bottleneck.</p>

    <p>The most important part of the "Infinite Energy Plan" is to find a container that can provide perpetual motion.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Shou Chong has set his sights on an infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>According to records in ancient books, this mysterious infinite realm contains the materials for him to make perpetual motion vessels.</p>

    <p>However, it is not easy to open this secret realm.</p>

    <p>He spent huge sums of money to hire a Soul Formation team of 100 people to create a magic circle that condensed spiritual energy deep in the desert.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the power of these 100 people is far from enough. It is difficult to tear open the cracks in the infinite secret realm. This is beyond Shou Chong's imagination.</p>

    <p>So now, there is the "Cultivator Animalization Plan" that he just launched not long ago.</p>

    <p>Based on Shou Chong's personality test calculations. Generally speaking, the big guys in the cultivation world seem to like to pretend to be ordinary people and live a low-key life hidden from the world...</p>

    <p>If his calculation is correct, once the collective life of human cultivators is shaken.</p>

    <p>These big guys whose lives have been disrupted will never sit idly by.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>These are just wishful guesses by Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>Even he didn't expect that the whole plan would go so smoothly.</p>

    <p>In the laboratory, several assistants hired by Shou Chong began to locate the recent psychic signal through their private satellites.</p>

    <p>The results of private satellite positioning are displayed in. Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>"What a familiar high school name." An assistant frowned.</p>

    <p>"It's that legendary high school! Legendary Zhuo Yi! I watched his interview a while ago. He said that he was obsessed with a washboard recently. Everyone is still discussing what it means." Another assistant couldn't laugh or cry. said.</p>

    <p>Because of the sentence Zhuo Yi, the price of washboards on the market has skyrocketed.</p>

    <p>Many cultivators believe that washboards can assist spiritual practice. So after Zhuo Yi's interview was broadcast, all the washboards in supermarkets and online stores were sold out.</p>

    <p>Now basically everyone is studying how the washboard is used in cultivation.</p>

    <p>In the Internet age where information is developed, every move you make after you become famous will have such a huge impact.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi's public appearance is actually a good thing.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a home-made tool...</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>It's a disciple.</p>

    <p>His disciple shines brightly outside. After all eyes are focused on him, it naturally has a certain hidden effect on him.</p>

    <p>For example, now.</p>

    <p>When Shou Chong discovered that the energy he was tracing originated from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>He immediately held a brief meeting with his laboratory assistants.</p>

    <p>"What do you think about this matter?" Shou Chong asked.</p>

    <p>"I think we need to classify the discussion according to the situation. Although the energy source comes from Number 60 High School, we do not rule out the possibility of a big boss passing by." An assistant said.</p>

    <p>"It's unlikely that he's just passing by. I think he's from Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>Another assistant took out the satellite map that was captured. When the picture was enlarged, what was captured happened to be the rooftop of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The result is that there are traces of censoring in the screen!</p>

    <p>And this mosaic cannot be fully analyzed with Shou Chong's technology. We don't know what this mosaic is.</p>

    <p>"If it were just a powerful person passing by."</p>

    <p>"I don't think it's so bad. We don't know anyone anyway. Why do you have to mosaic yourself on purpose. Don't you usually wear a mask or something? Like what. Uchiha Daishi?" The assistant said. "What the hell is an Uchiha Daishi?...Isn't it Uchiha Daigin?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Two assistants discussed.</p>

    <p>Such behavior is indeed a bit like covering one's ears and stealing the bell.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong touched his chin. From a behavioral perspective, if this person is from Number 60 High School, he doesn't want others to know who he is.</p>

    <p>Now. Shou Chong has his first suspicion.</p>

    <p>"Tell me, could this person be Zhuo Yi?" Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>"That's not true... Zhuo Yi is now in its prime. I don't know how many pairs of eyes are looking at him."</p>

    <p>"If it weren't for him, how could we explain that he has frequently fought at higher levels over the years and solved many major events that were impossible to solve at his level?"</p>

    <p>"There have been rumors outside that he has a master..."</p>

    <p>"I don't feel like there's a master."</p>

    <p>I don't think so Shou Chong shook his head. He said, "I'm afraid that he's showing off his strength on the outside. In fact, it is a kind of reverse thinking. Let others think that he has a powerful master behind him. That's why he's putting on that kind of attitude of being unafraid. But what if. He's the Master?"</p>

    <p>"The teacher is saying that Zhuo Yi is the same person as the master behind the rumors?"</p>

    <p>"I don't think this possibility can be ruled out."</p>

    <p>He has developed strong reasoning abilities through the theatrical version of the famous Detective Conan and various domestic mystery dramas.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong has almost determined it in his heart. This legendary master is a smoke bomb deliberately released by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi himself is actually a powerful person with powerful energy!</p>

    <p>More powerful than True Immortal! and the True Venerated Immortal master of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>But if the above reasoning is completely accurate, then the next thing Shou Chong has to think about is how to establish a connection with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Recently, is there any useful information related to this Zhuo Yi?" At this time, Shou Chong asked.</p>

    <p>"Information... I have a lot of gossip magazines here..." The assistant dug out some gossip magazines from the drawer.</p>

    <p>"Magazines are fine too." Shou Chong nodded.</p>

    <p>Many times the news in gossip magazines is not necessarily false.</p>

    <p>The key point is how to distinguish authenticity.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong held his chin and read several books in succession on his desk.</p>

    <p>Finally, he discovered an interesting piece of information.</p>

    <p>This is a piece of gossip about Zhuo Yi's late-night tryst with a mysterious young woman.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that this gossip reporter did not take a picture of this woman's face.</p>

    <p>But Shou Chong frowned. He felt that this young girl looked more and more familiar...</p>

    <p>This breast...</p>

    <p>This one has almost no scale...</p>

    <p>He seemed familiar. As if he had seen him somewhere.</p>

    <p>After a moment, Shou Chong suddenly slapped his head: "Jiugong Liangzi? Is it her?"</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Just relying on this part of the characteristics.</p>

    <p>And the sensitivity of being a homebody who has been single for many years.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong recognized Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>It's easier to handle now.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>He immediately took out his mobile phone and prepared to chat with Jiugong Liangzi via text message to confirm the authenticity.</p>

    <p>In the address book, Shou Chong's note to Jiugong Liangzi is: Princess Taiping.</p>
