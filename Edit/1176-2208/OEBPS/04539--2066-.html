  <h1>Chapter 2066 Xiao Yin's bloody story</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Muyu heard Yi Jianchuan say that he would take responsibility, he immediately lost his composure, although he was different from his father Wang Ling and could control his own power.</p>

    <p>Of course, the main reason was that he was not as strong as Wang Ling, who even if he didn't practice, he could become stronger just by lying down every day, so he had to rely on the seal.</p>

    <p>It's just like a person's skin becomes loose after losing weight too fast. It's a gradual process. The realm is like skin. If you can't keep up with the speed, it will naturally have certain effects.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu can control power, in the final analysis he still lacks accuracy. After all, he himself has never fired at this sluice...</p>

    <p>He has no idea at all what the appropriate ejection force is.</p>

    <p>That's all...</p>

    <p>Use the smallest amount of force. As long as it doesn't break down, he can't be blamed.</p>

    <p>At this time, a drop of cold sweat flowed down Wang Muyu's cheek. He learned very quickly. It was the Wuji Sword technique that Yi Jianchuan had just used.</p>

    <p>His young white palms were aimed at the calm lake behind him and turned slightly. Ripples suddenly appeared on the calm lake. A drop of lake water was picked up by him. It hovered steadily on his finger like a flying leaf on a flower.</p>

    <p>The Wuji Sword is still far behind the Stegosaurus gene that Wang Muyu has mastered. So Wang Muyu has never learned it.</p>

    <p>But even in this situation, his excellent cultivation talent and his own bloodline strength still played an important advantage. He only watched it once and he had completely learned it. All the movements and trajectories were so smooth that it is unimaginable. It was as if he had already perfected the technique. It shocked Yi Jianchuan's heart.</p>

    <p>This little guy is actually more talented than he thought.</p>

    <p>This is one of the most difficult mental techniques to practice in Wuji Sword Dao. Although it was not developed by him, but passed down by his master, the Sword Immortal Fan Rui, at that time, he practiced it for a full 10 years to achieve minor success, 30 years to achieve major success... and 50 years to fully practice this move to perfection.</p>

    <p>At that time, such comprehension was already amazing in the eyes of the sword immortal Fan Rui.</p>

    <p>It can be said that now that he has the status of Sword Saint and can become one of the founding fathers of the Huaxiu Nation, Yi Jianchuan's name of Sword Saint is recognized by the Earth's cultivation world and he is a sufficiently respected existence.</p>

    <p>When will a genius be struck?</p>

    <p>That's when he meets another genius stronger than himself...</p>

    <p>If Wang Muyu hadn't already been his disciple, Yi Jianchuan felt that although his mentality would not have collapsed, it would definitely be more complicated than it was now.</p>

    <p>It took him fifty years...</p>

    <p>This little guy learned it after just one look. And his movements were extremely smooth. He was even a bit prettier than him.</p>

    <p>Of course, the main reason is that the little guy is good-looking, like a porcelain doll. And Yi Jianchuan has felt that Wang Muyu looks familiar. It feels like he has met Wang Muyu somewhere.</p>

    <p>He probably hasn't seen it before. But it looks really familiar. Especially these eyes...</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan was constantly troubled in his heart.</p>

    <p>Because the information Lord Diulei gave him was that the little guy was an orphan without a father and a mother. He was currently the adopted great-great-grandson of the old Mr. Sun Yiyuan of the Sun family. He had been living in his ancestral home in the country until recently.</p>

    <p>Because when he picked up the Little Mu Yu, only the name "Wang Muyu" was left on him. So he has kept this name until now.</p>

    <p>Although this also explained to Yi Jianchuan why Wang Muyu is obviously Sun Yiyuan's great-grandson. But he didn't know why he feels that this story is far-fetched...</p>

    <p>How could he know? This story is of course far-fetched.</p>

    <p>Because the whole experience was basically made up by Xiao Yin, who had just started writing novels after learning from Father Wang, adding extravagant details and following the routines of online novels.</p>

    <p>Even Sun Yiyuan's memory was clearly arranged. According to Xiao Yin's setting, it was directly entered into the brain of Mr. Boss Sun without anyone noticing.</p>

    <p>You have to do this without anyone noticing.</p>

    <p>It is still very easy for Wang Ling. And the most important thing is that Mr. Boss Sun likes Muyu very much. Otherwise, implanting memories will inevitably have some side effects of rejection. But the old man likes him enough. Then everything would be easier to handle. In this way, he fully accepted Wang Muyu's bloody life experience.</p>

    <p>So the only real thing in the entire identity setting is that Wang Muyu is indeed Sun Yiyuan's great-grandson. And there are formal adoption procedures.</p>

    <p>And in order to echo this weird life background fabricated by Xiao Yin, the loopholes in the date were also modified privately by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>So Wang Muyu's current identity is indeed that of a genius orphan who grew up on earth and has nothing to do with the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>But the sword master's intuition is so strong. Even though such a seamless background story has been formed, he still has doubts.</p>

    <p>So, just before Wang Muyu was about to eject the water droplets, Yi Jianchuan asked out of nowhere: "By the way, Muyu, I wanted to ask you when I first met you, have we met somewhere? Or rather. Do you have any brother?"</p>

    <p>"No... the teacher is mistaken?" Wang Muyu said. He tried hard not to stutter.</p>

    <p>After all, he had made an agreement with Wang Ling a long time ago. In order not to cause trouble to Wang Ling, he would never reveal that he knew Wang Ling in front of outsiders.</p>

    <p>"I heard that you were brought to the city this time. Is it because you are proficient in alchemy? Did you come up with the idea of the Sun family's Seven Dragon Muyu Pill?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Muyu admitted directly. Because this was a story set for him. There was nothing hard to admit. It was just that there was a mixture of truth and falsehood in it.</p>

    <p>He tried to remain calm as best he could, preparing to launch the water droplet, when the Sword Saint's third sentence followed: "Hey, Muyu, you're so cute and so talented. From what I can tell, you're not only gifted in swordsmanship and alchemy, but you're also talented in other areas. You're quite the all-rounder."</p>

    <p>"The teacher compliments me generously. I'm not that good either." Wang Muyu said modestly.</p>

    <p>"No, no, no. This is by no means a compliment. I also admit that I have seen many geniuses. But you... are indeed completely different from them. Tell me what your parents thought at the beginning. Why did they just abandon you? ?And you are so smart and have such a talent. I guess your parents are also geniuses."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan talked endlessly. The more he read it carefully, the more he felt that it was like one of those bloody romance novels. What kind of genius made a private life-long commitment to an immortal woman, and then married someone else for various reasons. An immortal woman, etc. She failed to find a lover but still insisted on giving birth to a child to recognize her ancestors.</p>

    <p>As a result, on the day of delivery, she took the first step due to an accident. The child in her belly lost the last clue to find her father...</p>

    <p>Alas. Too pitiful, too miserable... and. too bloody...</p>

    <p>Is this really a plot that carbon-based organisms can write...</p>

    <p>If this is really the case, the scope is actually very easy to lock in. Although there are many people in the modern world of cultivation, there are only so many geniuses on the pyramid.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan felt that by following the elimination method, sooner or later he could help Wang Muyu find his biological parents.</p>

    <p>As a little guy's master, he must know the details and origins of the other person's biological parents.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, he suddenly looked at Wang Muyu and said, "Muyu, do you miss your parents? Maybe I can help you find them."</p>

    <p>"ah?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was immediately excited when Yi Jianchuan asked the question after a crazy barrage.</p>

    <p>The most frightening thing is that due to lack of concentration, Wang Muyu's power control was directly out of focus. He couldn't hold back at all. This drop of water directly turned into a laser.</p>

    <p>With a whooshing sound, it penetrated the sluice in front...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise!</p>

    <p>The dazzling light exploded directly with the "qi" condensed in the small water droplet. The two-hundred-meter sluice cracked directly from the middle. It collapsed suddenly!</p>

    <p>On the artificial lake. As the huge rocks that were blown up fell into the water, waves rolled on the water. Dozens of water columns rose and fell one after another.</p>

    <p>It's hard to believe that Wang Muyu actually blew up the entire sluice with just one finger.</p>

    <p>Along with the smoke and dust rising everywhere.</p>

    <p>On the bamboo raft, the master and apprentice finally fell into silence. Each was in a mess in the wind...</p>
