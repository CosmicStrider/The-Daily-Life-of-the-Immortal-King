  <h1>Chapter 1748 Duobao City Intelligence Confirmation Team</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For Tengu, this is a very rare and big deal. And the explosive news of the intelligence is enough to alarm the entire business circle of the cultivation world. It is comparable to a major earthquake of more than ten magnitude.</p>

    <p>On the surface, it is surprising that a underage eldest daughter of a consortium actually gave birth to a child before getting married. This incident is shocking enough.</p>

    <p>From a deeper perspective, the child in this photo looks to be five or six years old. If it is really the child of Sun Rong, then he must have taken some medicine that can induce birth in a short period of time. </p>

    <p>"The boss thinks that Huaguo Shuilian Group has used drugs? No way..."</p>

    <p>"Don't underestimate the ugly faces of these capitalists." Tengu chuckled and said, "According to my inference, their purpose should be to use induction to confuse the time when this rich lady actually gave birth to a child."</p>

    <p>"Of course. I don't have any evidence right now. So there is a lot of material to be mined in this matter."</p>

    <p>"If it works, we can make a lot of money."</p>

    <p>"Still the old way?" asked the boy.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Tengu nodded: "Drop a copy of this scandalous intelligence message to all sides, including the Huaguo Shuilian Group, in addition to the companies that bid on it. Then let them bid on the information and the highest bidder will win."</p>

    <p>"Yes." The boy nodded: "I'll make arrangements right away."</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>Just before the subordinate was about to leave, Tengu suddenly stopped him.</p>

    <p>"What else does the boss have to say?"</p>

    <p>"Remember to be polite when you go to invite Miss Sun Rong. We are not bandits after all."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Also. Let the intelligence confirmation team use our newly equipped global face tracking system when they go to find her."</p>

    <p>Tengu smiled: "This is the masterpiece of Mr. Shou Chong, a famous scientist on the internet. I waited in line to order for a long time before I got it. I finally caught this opportunity. Just do the experiment."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For all information that passes through the Duobao City underground intelligence black market, the Duobao City Underground Intelligence Network has its own native confirmation team to confirm the authenticity of the information.</p>

    <p>The bigger the matter, the more cautious it is to confirm. After receiving the order from Tengu, the intelligence confirmation team immediately entered the facial recognition information of Sun Rong according to the plan. Using the information customized from Shou Chong system for global tracking.</p>

    <p>The black van drove through the Ring Expressway according to the navigation system. After many twists and turns, it finally arrived in front of an affordable apartment.</p>

    <p>"Strange. How come the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group lives in a place like this?" The old driver in charge of driving in the intelligence team stopped the car and asked suspiciously while drinking wolfberry tea.</p>

    <p>His name is Sekiro. He is responsible for guiding people.</p>

    <p>"Master Shou Chong said that this face tracking system is combined with big data intelligence tracking. Every surveillance camera in the world is connected to the Internet. Real-time positioning. Accurate tracking. There is basically no error." At this time, the intelligence confirmation team. A person named Yin Hu said.</p>

    <p>He is the small leader of this confirmation team. He is the main person responsible for "asking" Sun Rong to talk.</p>

    <p>Maintaining trust in the facial recognition system, Yin Hu got out of the car with another team member named Kangaroo.</p>

    <p>He was holding an iPad. Finally he came to a security door.</p>

    <p>They had put on disguised white coats and wore stethoscopes on their chests. They looked like doctors in a clinic.</p>

    <p>Confirming intelligence is their main job.</p>

    <p>There are also many ways to confirm information. It is not necessary to directly find the person involved and ask for such clear information. Instead, use roundabout ways to obtain information to confirm the information. This is Yin Hu's consistent approach.</p>

    <p>Just like his code name, it is full of the color of an old fox.</p>

    <p>"It's right inside." Yin Hu frowned. Then he quickly controlled the expression on his face and politely reached out and pressed the doorbell.</p>

    <p>Not long after, a girl's voice came from inside the security door: "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>It's Jiang Yingying himself...</p>

    <p>She is doing her homework.</p>

    <p>And her face was flushed red, because today there was a high school human biology class at school, and as an adolescent girl she was thinking about many things when she was writing her homework, but she didn't realize that an untimely doorbell suddenly interrupted all her thoughts.</p>

    <p>Because she had learned from the past, Jiang Yingying acted very cautiously this time. She did not open the door for others randomly. Instead, she tried to confirm the identity of the other party through the peephole.</p>

    <p>Standing in front of her door at this moment were two young men wearing white coats. They also had stethoscopes. They didn't look like bad people?</p>

    <p>But she still didn't choose to open the door.</p>

    <p>Such a vigilant attitude made Yin Hu feel a little funny.</p>

    <p>But for a veteran who uses fraudulent information to confirm the authenticity of intelligence. Even if there is a security door or even if the door is not opened, this will not be a problem for him.</p>

    <p>The first thing to do, of course, is to confirm your identity.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu thought for a moment. He did not ask the other party's name directly.</p>

    <p>Because he and Kangaroo are both disguised as community doctors. If you directly ask each other's name, it will definitely arouse greater alertness. It is not conducive to intelligence fraud.</p>

    <p>So, after thinking for a while, Yin Hu narrowed his eyes and smiled: "Hello, lady, we are community doctors nearby. Please don't be afraid. Think about it. Your grandfather is so powerful. How can we have the courage? ."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiang Yingying nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>Her grandpa is really awesome.</p>

    <p>That's Martial Saint Jiang!</p>

    <p>These two community doctors know this. It seems that they are not bad people.</p>

    <p>"It's good that you know."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying hummed and smiled.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Yin Hu also recorded in his little notebook: [During the inquiry process, the other party has admitted that she has a very powerful grandfather...]</p>

    <p>On the other side, Daishu who was traveling with him also used the magic weapon of perspective to see through the security door the face of Jiang Yingying who was wearing pajamas inside the security door.</p>

    <p>Then, Daishu nodded and gave the Yin Hu an OK sign.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu recorded it in his little notebook again; [Daishu used the clairvoyance magic weapon to secretly confirm that the girl inside the security door is indeed Sun Rong...]</p>

    <p>There was silence. Yin Hu heard Jiang Yingying ask again: "Then why are you coming to me now?"</p>

    <p>"Just wanted to ask a quick question."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu said: "Our community clinic has always paid great attention to the physical knowledge and health of young people. I wonder what this lady thinks about having children before marriage."</p>

    <p>He asked this question. It sounded like an ordinary question asked on a regular basis. He just added some tricks while asking. For example, he deliberately enlarged the words "pregnancy before marriage."</p>

    <p>After hearing these four words, Jiang Yingying's face suddenly turned red: "This... this must not be good... how can there be such..."</p>

    <p>So. Yin Hu recorded in the notebook: [Combined with Daishu synchronous perspective observation data. When the words "pregnancy before marriage" were mentioned during the questioning process, the other party's hands and feet were unnatural, her eyes were wandering, and her face was flushed. This is a typical sign of lying... ]</p>

    <p>After writing this, Yin Hu closed the notebook.</p>

    <p>That's enough questions. Now it's time to take action...</p>

    <p>He put the notebook away. Then he took out a bottle of green liquid from his pocket. Then he poured it all on the security door.</p>

    <p>This bottle of green liquid is a gold-eating insect. It can easily break through metal bunkers. It is an essential weapon for breaking doors...</p>
