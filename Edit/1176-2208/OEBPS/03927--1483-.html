  <h1>Chapter 1483 Judgment of Zhuo Yi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Martial Saint's granddaughter was kidnapped. If this news got out, it would probably shock the whole country.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Sun Rong handled it very well and did not aggravate the situation further. Not only did they eliminate the blind alien in time, they also obtained a lot of intelligence and saved Jiang Yingying and Wei Zhi. life.</p>

    <p>But right now, she was still worried about Wei Zhi's condition.</p>

    <p>Although Wei Zhi was treated and returned, the situation was indeed unexpected.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that those two things are too big... Sun Rong feels even more exaggerated than the Shadow Stream Lord who was captured at the beginning.</p>

    <p>However, it is not realistic to send the patient to the hospital in this situation.</p>

    <p>After that, Sun Rong settled Jiang Yingying in a hotel and assigned a female private doctor whom he trusted to take care of her.</p>

    <p>Then he took Wei Zhi back to Wei Zhi's own room. Then he immediately contacted Zhuo Yi to check the situation.</p>

    <p>When they met, Sun Rong smelled the smell of durian on Zhuo Yi: "Zhuo Yi Senior, did you eat durian?"</p>

    <p>"Ah. I'm sorry. Don't you like the taste? You were in a hurry and didn't rinse your mouth."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I also like to eat durian." Sun Rong smiled. Zhuo Yi felt a sense of fatigue evident on the girl's face.</p>

    <p>Although the "passive version of the combination of man and sword" can indeed improve the girl's combat power, if she is in a state of continuous mental stress, the consumption will increase.</p>

    <p>In the end, it's often not a lack of physical strength, but a sense of mental fatigue. It doesn't have any side effects... it's just that it's easy to get sleepy. Once you wake up, you'll be fine.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, if you were more relaxed throughout the battle, there would be no problem.</p>

    <p>Previously, Zhuo Yi relied on the girl to make that call for help. He already had a general understanding of the entire battle process.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi almost died...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid this is one of the main causes of mental stress.</p>

    <p>Master Wife still lacks some combat experience.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled helplessly in his heart.</p>

    <p>In fact, he missed a very important point...</p>

    <p>In fact, the main reason for the girl's mental stress was that during the battle, she was always thinking about reuniting with Wang Ling as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>After all, she had fought with Old God before.</p>

    <p>Who is Old God?</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang's first love. The creative leader of the divine world.</p>

    <p>In that battle, facing the Old God, the girl never showed any fear.</p>

    <p>What's more, facing an alien whose combat power is far inferior to that of the Old God?</p>

    <p>"It's better to resolve this matter as soon as possible..." Zhuo Yi muttered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that the girl needed a rest very much now. The tiredness could actually be reflected in her expression.</p>

    <p>It is probably the sense of responsibility that supports the girl and prevents herself from falling.</p>

    <p>Walking to the big bed where Wei Zhi was lying, Zhuo Yi rubbed his eyes. He thought he had seen it wrong: "Why do brother Wei Zhi have two basketballs on his body?"</p>

    <p>"I want to know too..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong dumbfounded: "That's why I asked the senior to help me take a look."</p>

    <p>"You said something big happened on the phone. Is this what you were referring to?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help laughing: "After eating the White Rabbit toffee that Master gave you, Brother Wei Zhi came back to life. Then these two basketballs appeared, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stared at Wei Zhi who was very "swollen" on the bed. He hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and touched it with a red face: "Brother Wei Zhi. I'm offended..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong turned his face slightly. He also felt that his face was a little hot.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. She feels like Zhuo Yi is very skilled...</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong The school girl thinks my skills are very skillful, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"When I was working at the grassroots level in the army, I helped the army raise cows. That's how I got there."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After holding it for about ten seconds, Zhuo Yi finally let go. Then he couldn't help but smile: "I roughly know what this is going on."</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior, do you know how to solve it?"</p>

    <p>"The milk candy given by the master has the effect of rapidly and continuously increasing spiritual power.</p>

    <p>From a biological point of view, the chest is composed of muscle fibers and fat. The reason for the expansion of Brother Wei Zhi is another." Zhuo Yi held his chin and analyzed: "After Brother Wei Zhi died, a large number of cells in the body followed him. At the same time, the blood will lose power due to the heart stopping and will be unable to flow. The proteins in the blood will then become corrupted and eventually lost as the water evaporates..."</p>

    <p>"Originally, brother Wei Zhi was indeed dead. But fortunately, Sun Rong's schoolmate was treated in time. The milk candy given by the master also provided different spiritual power from ordinary spiritual power. In addition to assisting in practice, it also repaired The functions of body functions are divided into spiritual power molecules for cultivation and spiritual power molecules for repair."</p>

    <p>"The spiritual power molecules used for practice are released slowly and continuously. They will not cause a backlog. But the spiritual power molecules for repair are different. But because Brother Wei Zhi is dead, all the ones activated by this toffee are all repairs. The psychic molecules used."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Sun Rong feels like he has come to some understanding.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "When a large amount of spiritual power was formed in Brother Wei Zhi's body, these spiritual powers began to repair his cells. Finally, Brother Wei Zhi came back to life."</p>

    <p>"So that's it!" Sun Rong suddenly realized: "So Brother Wei Zhi now..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. What is actually stored in Brother Wei Zhi's current basketball are these spiritual molecules used for repair. Generally, there is no need for special treatment. After a period of time, the swelling will subside on its own."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "When brother Wei Zhi wakes up later, you can tell him directly that it is a short-term side effect caused by the elixir used to treat the body. Tell him not to worry too much."</p>

    <p>"In other words, this toffee has no breast enlargement effect?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er's voice suddenly came out.</p>

    <p>"Master is a serious person. Of course there is no such thing..."</p>

    <p>"Hey." Sun Ying'er sighed in disappointment: "It seems that Ling Zhenren still doesn't understand Rongrong's feelings. She is really underdeveloped!"</p>

    <p>"You are so underdeveloped... You obviously want to..." Sun Rong blushed. I don't know if it was because of shyness, or because he was a little angry at Sun Ying'er's incoherent words.</p>

    <p>"The last question. Why are these repaired spiritual energy molecules accumulated in the chest?" At this time, Sun Ying'er asked again.</p>

    <p>"Because originally, this was Master's specially customized model for women. It was ergonomically designed for women. But I didn't expect that it would be eaten by Brother Wei Zhi."</p>

    <p>"And there are men?"</p>

    <p>"some."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded and said: "It's just that for men, the swelling is in another place. That is: the bladder."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time Zhuo Yi looked at the time: "It's too late. Brother Wei Zhi is fine. It'll be fine in two or three days. Sun Rong The school girl has worked hard today. I think she can rest early. You He looked very tired."</p>

    <p>"No... I'm fine..."</p>

    <p>After confirming that Wei Zhi was safe and sound, Sun Rong felt as if a huge stone had been lifted off his body. His whole body became much more relaxed.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Still... waiting for me..."</p>

    <p>She turned around. She was still thinking about Wang Ling in her mind. But now she couldn't help but fight.</p>

    <p>After walking a few steps toward the door, his vision went dark and he fell down.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stepped forward and held the girl steady.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>Still can't hold it any longer.</p>

    <p>He knew it would be like this...</p>

    <p>I had no choice but to settle the mistress in the hotel first.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi thought to himself.</p>

    <p>He asked Sun Ying'er to help hold Sun Rong in Wei Zhi's room for a while. He ran to the front desk to get a presidential suite.</p>

    <p>As a result, when registering, the front desk manager said: "It's like this, Mr. Zhuo. A young man came here just now. He said that he had already reserved a room for Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>"Isn't he a dead fish-eyed person with beautiful features?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Then the front desk manager took out a room card: "This is the annual pass to the presidential suite left by the boy. And some candies."</p>

    <p>"Where are the others?"</p>

    <p>"I guess I'm going home..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Although he was not surprised by this result, Zhuo Yi still secretly lamented the pity.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for this alien episode, maybe the master and his wife would have become...</p>

    <p>"Where are the candies?" Zhuo Yi asked after accepting the room card given by the front desk manager.</p>

    <p>The front desk manager smiled slightly. Then he took out a bunch of things from under the table and put it on the table: "This sack is all."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
