  <h1>Chapter 1293 Earth's Tribulation Transcendence Road</h1>

  <div>



<p>In the distance, Heavenly Dao didn't know what to say to describe his mood at the moment.</p>

<p>"Senior, the seven major families who took action were beaten so badly. Will they really take action again?"</p>

<p>Buddha Golden Lotus. Sun Rong asked.</p>

<p>"In the God's Domain, except for the Gu family and the Wang family, which often rotate between the first and second positions, the rankings of the other eight major families will change more or less every year. Because the gap itself is not too big, there is no way. Really stabilize the ranking."</p>

<p>Death Heavenly Dao said: "Even if those seven families don't take action against the Wang family and the Gu family, I'm afraid they will join forces to settle the accounts with the tenth-ranked Liu family."</p>

<p>The Liu family was the only one who got a big advantage in this incident.</p>

<p>The heritage of these seven major families cannot catch up with the Wang family and the Gu family. Therefore, the real impact on the Wang family and the Gu family is not that big.</p>

<p>But now after this battle, the foundation has been chipped away.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to shortening the gap between the Liu family and these seven major families.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the possibility of the Liu family taking advantage of the chaos, there is indeed a high possibility that these seven major families will join forces to seek revenge...</p>

<p>And they only pick out soft persimmons to pinch.</p>

<p>"Can Heavenly Dao punish Dao God?" At this time, Zhuo Yi also asked a question out of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Except for whitelist users and Dao Ancestor. No one can surpass Heavenly Dao..." Death Heavenly Dao sighed and said: "My current combat power cannot resist Dao God. Mainly because Heavenly Dao's power has been divided. If We are three thousand Heavenly Dao combined. We can lift the Dao God."</p>

<p>"Then can you hang my master up and beat him?"</p>

<p>"I can't... I might be killed..." Death Heavenly Dao felt helpless.</p>

<p>In fact, he had always had a bold guess.</p>

<p>That is the power currently shown by Wang Ling. It may not be his full combat power.</p>

<p>Back then, Dao Ancestor divided Heavenly Dao and divided it into three thousand Heavenly Dao. It was just for the purpose of checking and balancing power.</p>

<p>If there are other Ling Zhenren existing in the parallel space of this universe.</p>

<p>So when these "Ling Zhenren" are all combined...</p>

<p>How strong does that have to be?</p>

<p>But all of these are speculations and assumptions of Heavenly Dao.</p>

<p>He didn't dare to think more about it.</p>

<p>One Wang Ling is enough to make Heavenly Dao restless...</p>

<p>If all Wang Ling in all spaces were merged, wouldn't Heavenly Dao be able to be "killed?"</p>

<p>On the way back to Earth, Heavenly Dao discovered that the girl was frantically entering information into the "little notebook."</p>

<p>It seems that the harvest of God's Domain this time is quite large.</p>

<p>"What have you realized?" Death Heavenly Dao asked Sun Rong.</p>

<p>"The seniors of God's Domain are indeed very strong. And their brain circuits are very novel." Sun Rong answered truthfully.</p>

<p>She recorded all the pictures she just saw in the form of words. Then she recorded the pictures she saw on a hand-drawn tablet to prevent herself from forgetting.</p>

<p>"Sun Rong school girl can actually draw?"</p>

<p>In the core world of Death Heavenly Dao. Zhuo Yi is holding the Buddha Golden Lotus. He is also surprised.</p>

<p>In a sense, girls are also very versatile in all aspects of their talents.</p>

<p>"I just learned it by playing around when I had nothing to do." Sun Rong said modestly.</p>

<p>"As a friendly reminder, Sun Rong, if you draw my master's face on it, it will most likely turn into a mosaic..." At this time, Zhuo Yi said.</p>

<p>After the Great Shielding Technique has been upgraded several times, the shielding effect has become stronger.</p>

<p>God knows what will happen in the end...</p>

<p>"Don't worry, senior Zhuo Yi. I didn't draw the face of classmate Wang Ling at all. Look! This is what I drew!" Sun Rong made his drawing public.</p>

<p>What she is painting is the scene where the virtual image of Wang Ling fights against the six Dao God virtual images.</p>

<p>Originally, the virtual image meant that the face could not be seen clearly.</p>

<p>So the girl only drew the outline of Wang Ling's back.</p>

<p>Then I drew a series of "ellipses" on the head.</p>

<p>"This is?!" Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

<p>"This is the identity of classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

<p>Sun Rong stared at his painting. He nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p><p>...</p>



<p>The matter of upgrading the earth has been settled.</p>

<p>Jin Deng and Miss Ajuan died first in Heavenly Dao and returned to the earth. The monk's ability to shrink to an inch was incredible. It was several minutes faster than the speed of direct teleportation in Heavenly Dao.</p>

<p>Their next step is to go to the Office of Strategic Deception. Tell Lord Diulei about the upgrade of the earth.</p>

<p>In order for the earth to complete its upgrade, the entire earth will experience a terrible Tribulation Transcendence scene...</p>

<p>That's right. This is not a Tribulation Transcendence between cultivators.</p>

<p>It's about the Tribulation Transcendence of the Earth!</p>

<p>The earth needs to survive this wave of disasters to complete the upgrade!</p>

<p>At this moment, in the True Venerated Immortal Hall of the Office of Strategic Deception, the leaders of each group gathered.</p>

<p>Lord Diulei, Zhenyuan immortal, Fang Xing, and Crispy Noodles Dao Lord from the security team were all present.</p>

<p>"The divine crystals of Heavenly Dao are extremely powerful. It is easy to upgrade the earth. But whether the earth can withstand the catastrophe is a question." Miss Ajuan said.</p>

<p>"What does the planet's catastrophe look like?" Lord Diulei wondered.</p>

<p>Regarding this matter, most people are actually not very clear about it.</p>

<p>Because few people have experienced the Tribulation Transcendence of the planet...</p>

<p>The only people who might know something about it are the immortal people in Zhenyuan.</p>

<p>He has been working on restoring the Drought Star.</p>

<p>Because the project volume is relatively complex and huge, the work progress has been very slow.</p>

<p>However, the people of Zhenyuan Immortal are always happy to build Drought Star. It is as interesting as playing MC.</p>

<p>"Normal cultivators' Tribulation Transcendence. Most of them focus on Tianlei."</p>

<p>At this time, the monk said: "The power and coverage scale of this Tribulation Transcendence sky thunder are related to the realm. The higher the realm, the greater the coverage and power of the sky thunder. However, the planet Tribulation Transcendence. This scale must cover the whole world."</p>

<p>"What the monk means is that if the Earth's Tribulation Transcendence is not properly handled, many cultivators may be shocked!" Miss Ajuan agreed.</p>

<p>"Does it cover the whole world..." Lord Diulei was surprised.</p>

<p>This is a planet-specific Tribulation Transcendence upgrade.</p>

<p>Then the power of thunder is naturally unparalleled.</p>

<p>If a cultivator outside is hit, he will probably die.</p>

<p>"I understand what the master means. What the master means is for me to communicate with countries all over the world. Let the cultivators do their best to protect themselves from the catastrophe?"</p>

<p>Fang Xing held his chin up and shook his head: "I don't think this is enough. It's like a flu outbreak. You can't make everyone obey and stay at home. There are always people who want to go out and have a look."</p>

<p>"Brother Fang is right..."</p>

<p>"Staying at home or using magic weapons for protection is far from enough to solve the problem."</p>

<p>At this time, the monk shook his head: "Zhenjun thinks things are too simple. The scale of the earth's Tribulation Transcendence covering the whole world is certain. But the poor monk did not say that. The method of this Tribulation Transcendence must be the thunder of heaven..."</p>

<p>In fact, it would be easier to deal with the thunder. They just need to find a way to guide the thunder to one place.</p>

<p>Ling Zhenren. That is a living lightning rod of human flesh!</p>

<p>However, the Earth's Tribulation Transcendence. It's not just as simple as the thunder coming from the sky...</p>

<p>This will be an impact launched by the condensed power of various planetary spirits like the "Solar Spirit!"</p>

<p>As far as the monk knows, the energy of these planet spirits comes from the chaos of the universe...</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, it is the same as the matter in the middle level chaos circle of the "Unspeakable Land."</p>

<p>If a cultivator from the divine realm soaks in it, he will be dead in three minutes.</p>

<p>Cultivators of Earth...</p>

<p>I'm afraid you'll die if you touch it.</p>

<p>"Master, do you have a solution?" At this time, Lord Diulei asked.</p>

<p>"The poor monk has an egg..." the monk said.</p>

<p>"Me too!"</p>

<p>Lord Diulei raised two fingers: "Still two!"</p>
    
<p>Jin Deng: "???<sup>1</sup>"</p>
