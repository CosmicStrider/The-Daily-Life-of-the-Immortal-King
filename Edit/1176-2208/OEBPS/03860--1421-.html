  <h1>Chapter 1421 Leng Ming's first battle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Jingke has accepted Leng Ming as his disciple, whether Wang Nuan's spirit sword is Leng Ming or not. Wang Ling still needs to be judged through this actual battle.</p>

    <p>He needed to know how far Leng Ming could grow after two days of special combat training.</p>

    <p>And this Sword conference was just a good opportunity to test Leng Ming's learning efficiency.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, learning ability is the key.</p>

    <p>After all, if you want to find a spirit sword suitable for being a nanny for Ah Nuan girl, you have to be proficient in everything. And Leng Ming still has many, many things to learn.</p>

    <p>The bronze group competition is about to begin.</p>

    <p>At the front of the old sword field is a viewing seat made of crystal. This is a viewing seat exclusively for the judges.</p>

    <p>Jiu You, Yu Ling who speaks nicely, Mo Yu who speaks nicely and Xiao Qian.</p>

    <p>The four major judges of this Sword conference are all seated in this crystal room.</p>

    <p>"The bronze group competition will start soon. I wonder how the little guy's performance will be?" Yu Ling said.</p>

    <p>She crossed her slender legs. The pink cheongsam with high slits hung down to the ground along her long legs, attracting the attention of many sword spirits in the spectator seats.</p>

    <p>"White!"</p>

    <p>"Idiot! Those are safety pants!"</p>

    <p>"You are the idiots! How can you be disrespectful to Master Yu Ling? Look away your dirty eyes!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Sword King world, Yu Ling's popularity has always been very high. This is expected.</p>

    <p>Mo Yu also has many fans, but because he is so good, he often appears in front of outsiders. Compared to Yu Ling, he seems to lack a bit of mystery.</p>

    <p>Ignoring the commotion in the spectator seats, Jiu You also expressed his excitement for this bronze group match: "It is said that Mr. Jingke personally gave special training to the kid Leng Ming."</p>

    <p>"What kind of special training is it?" Mo Yu asked curiously. The jade corolla on his head emitted a beautiful light.</p>

    <p>"It seems to be a mixed doubles match. Mr. Jingke and Mr. Bai Qiao will play together." Jiu You answered.</p>

    <p>"Shit. Isn't this just domestic violence..." Mo Yu suddenly felt a little pitiful for Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>"It was repaired after the fight. And in order to prevent the child Leng Ming from leaving a psychological shadow. It is said that Mr. Bai Qiao cleared the memory of the special training."</p>

    <p>"Everything has been emptied? What's the use then..."</p>

    <p>"Because there is no need to use brain memory anymore. When fighting later, what Leng Ming will show may be muscle reaction memory."</p>

    <p>"..." Yu Ling and Mo Yu were shocked.</p>

    <p>How many times does it take mixed doubles to form muscle memory?</p>

    <p>Soon. Accompanied by the roar of gongs and drums in the sword fighting arena all day long.</p>

    <p>200 sword spirits from the bronze group enter.</p>

    <p>The four entrances to the sword fighting arena were opened at the same time. At each entrance, 50 sword spirits were introduced into the arena in an orderly manner by the royal sword guards. They were arranged in four rows, forming a square array.</p>

    <p>And Leng Ming was in the team coming out of the east exit. He was extremely small, but he stood at the first one. He looked like a little kid.</p>

    <p>In the audience, many sword spirits commented on this.</p>

    <p>"Is this the sword master's new apprentice? It looks ordinary to me!"</p>

    <p>"With extremely high talent values, he reached the top of the Sword Monument test. But after all, he was only born a few days ago. How strong is his true combat power?"</p>

    <p>Although the news of Leng Ming being accepted as a disciple by Jingke has spread throughout the Sword King world, doubts are still inevitable.</p>

    <p>No one would doubt Leng Ming's talent.</p>

    <p>After all, the values on the sword tablet cannot be false.</p>

    <p>However, from the time Leng Ming was accepted as a disciple by Jingke to the start of the Sword Conference, there were actually no more than two days.</p>

    <p>If you round up according to the number of hours, it's not even two days...</p>

    <p>In such a short period of time, many people will put a question mark on how far a newly born little sword spirit can grow.</p>

    <p>Facing the huge crowds of people surrounding the sword fighting arena, I listened to the doubts pouring into the air.</p>

    <p>In the Tianzihao room, Sun Rong frowned slightly. She was worried about Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Originally, she wanted to use this Sword Conference to find a sword spirit for Wang Nuan during the competition. But the atmosphere now was so tense! She couldn't help but feel nervous!</p>

    <p>"After all, it is such a large-scale Sword conference. Just watching it makes people feel overwhelmed. Miss Sun has some emotional fluctuations in her heart. It is also a normal reaction." Wu Jin comforted from the side.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong's nervous reaction is so cute."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er chuckled on the side: "Do you feel like you are waiting for your child's report card to come out?"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was startled.</p>

    <p>Don't say it. This is really true for Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>It's okay not to say...</p>

    <p>There seems to be some truth to this.</p>

    <p>It was obviously the first time I met Leng Ming. Sun Rong I didn't know why I felt this way about Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because it's the relationship between Jingke's disciples...</p>

    <p>Since he can be accepted as a disciple by Jingke, does the classmate Wang Ling also have high expectations for Leng Ming?</p>

    <p>"Little guy, you must work hard!" Sun Rong clenched his fists, silently cheering Leng Ming in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Hehe!" Sun Ying'er smiles inwardly from the side.</p>

    <p>She didn't pay much attention to the competition. Her eyes were fixed on Sun Rong from the beginning to the end. In comparison, the girl's interesting reaction was much more exciting than the competition.</p>

    <p>Just imagine. More than ten years later, her family Rongrong and her children...</p>

    <p>Then she took her own children to attend the parent-teacher meeting together, waiting for the final report card. Maybe she was also very nervous, right?</p>

    <p>Having developed his imagination at this point, Sun Ying'er quickly shook his head.</p>

    <p>She felt that she was thinking too much...</p>

    <p>What kind of child is not a child?</p>

    <p>Why did you think about the child's problem...</p>

    <p>And even if she gives birth to a child, who she will give birth to is still a problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying?</p>

    <p>That nasty gorilla?</p>

    <p>She would jump from here and starve to death! She would never agree to be with this guy!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this time, a picture came from the magic ball. Accompanied by a fiery explosion, a big explosion occurred in the center of the entire sword fighting arena!</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Ying'er was thinking wildly, the melee in the bronze group had already begun.</p>

    <p>And to everyone's surprise, everyone thought that this melee was a big fight between each other.</p>

    <p>The result was the moment Jiu You announced the start of the competition.</p>

    <p>Except Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>All the bronze spirit swords turned into sword lights and soared into the sky...</p>

    <p>Their movements were uniform and their goals were astonishingly synchronized!</p>

    <p>There were a total of 199 sword lights of various colors. They rushed towards Leng Ming!</p>

    <p>When these sword lights collided together, a big explosion occurred!</p>

    <p>In the thick smoke, two spiritual swords, one ice and one fire, broke out. They are the famous ice and fire brothers of the bronze group. According to the ranking, they were jointly selected into the melee of the bronze group.</p>

    <p>They rank second and third respectively in the bronze group sword monument list.</p>

    <p>Second only to Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>After the results of Leng Ming's sword tablet came out, the two brothers worked together to find an opportunity to teach Leng Ming a lesson.</p>

    <p>As a result, when the game started, I couldn't help it on the spot.</p>

    <p>What the two brothers didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>The other sword spirits in this game had the same thinking as the two of them. As soon as the game started, they all attacked Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>"Under such an offensive, even if you are Lord Jingke's disciple, what will happen?" The Ice and Fire brothers sneered in their hearts.</p>

    <p>At this time, a ray of emerald green sword light rose into the sky.</p>

    <p>The powerful sword energy tore through the thick smoke.</p>

    <p>A boy wearing rattan armor patted the ashes expressionlessly and slowly walked out of the torn and billowing smoke.</p>

    <p>He was unscathed. There wasn't even a speck of dust on his face.</p>

    <p>This is the effect of special training after receiving mixed doubles from Jingke and Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Although Leng Ming is just a grass.</p>

    <p>But now, this grass is very hard.</p>

    <p>Although I owe more and more, I will definitely pay it back...I won't finish it until I pay it off. Don't worry, everyone.</p>
