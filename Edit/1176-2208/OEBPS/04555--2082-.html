  <h1>Chapter 2082 There's a quarrel!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone is puzzled.</p>

    <p>Why is it that those with lower realms charge cheaper, while those with higher realms charge more?</p>

    <p>This is immortal gold.</p>

    <p>In addition to spiritual stones, it is one of the international currencies in the modern world of cultivation. It is no better than ordinary money.</p>

    <p>Even if a casual cultivator can afford it on his own, he still has to weigh it.</p>

    <p>They usually live frugally. They even have to spend money carefully to buy a magic weapon. Now they have to spend so much money to enter the restricted sea area. Every one of them feels a little sick.</p>

    <p>However. Having said that, most people can actually see that Zhang Zhui is indeed powerful. Although everyone has never heard of Zhang Zhui's name before, the encrypted call between the Sword Master and Mi Xiu Yuan Zun just now. But This person translated it!</p>

    <p>In other words, this person's strength is at least the ninth level of True Immortal or even higher...</p>

    <p>There's a high probability. Maybe it's also a hidden Venerated Immortal?</p>

    <p>"Shouldn't a high-level car be cheaper?" Some people questioned. Although they want to get on the car, the price is too expensive.</p>

    <p>"But in our eyes, you are all the same. Once you encounter an insurmountable danger, there is no escape from any state. In the face of a catastrophe, Ah Zi. Golden Core, Foundation Building. Is there any difference?"</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei made a speech, which left many people here speechless: "The reason for the small collection is that we can help you bring back the whole corpse. If you are at a low level, it is easier to spark. And the storage containers are not that expensive."</p>

    <p>"..." When everyone heard this, the whole place fell silent.</p>

    <p>Only Yi Jianchuan in the distance couldn't help but laugh. He thought Yue Lingwei was very interesting.</p>

    <p>I'm thinking about whether to take the train with them.</p>

    <p>After all, the two major cultivators Xiu Xiu and Mi Xiu have entered. And Yi Jianchuan also received instructions from Huaxiu Yuan Zun. Since he is nearby, he might as well follow up and see what is going on.</p>

    <p>I can only say that sometimes these words are too blunt. It does hurt people. But the biggest effect is that it directly touches the soul.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei was clearly telling this group of casual cultivators the dangers of this trip.</p>

    <p>And five hundred thousand immortal gold. This is not something that a casual cultivator can easily get.</p>

    <p>So he looks like a profiteer by being so arrogant and unreasonable. In fact, he is deliberately setting up obstacles for these casual cultivators.</p>

    <p>Because Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui knew very well that if this group of people really went in, once a fight started inside, the situation would probably be out of control, and they would all be buried there.</p>

    <p>Even if they have great ability to protect so many people at the same time, the focus of their mission is still for Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>The second step is to take the opportunity to find out what happened to the lost Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>So Yue Lingwei said, "You can't get in the car or not. You make your own decision." After that, most of the casual cultivators at the scene immediately dispersed.</p>

    <p>For them, they simply couldn't afford the money. If they wanted to force their way in, they didn't have much confidence in their own personal strength. Therefore, many people finally calmed down and gave up after Yue Lingwei's words of stimulation.</p>

    <p>Of course, Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui are not completely out of business.</p>

    <p>What neither of them expected was.</p>

    <p>The Sword Master actually brought Wang Muyu over...</p>

    <p>The scene was embarrassing for a time.</p>

    <p>"Two people. One million immortal gold." The sword master laughed and threw the kit directly into Yue Lingwei's hands.</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei was relieved that he was in danger. After accepting it, he let the two of them get into the car.</p>

    <p>Originally, his mission was to protect Wang Muyu. Now that they were both in the car, it saved him trouble.</p>

    <p>Then, Yi Jianchuan snapped his fingers and released Wang Muyu's water polo state directly in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. Did you let your disciple be exposed like this?"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. You two seem to be very particular people. And I can feel that my little apprentice doesn't hate you."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei, Zhang Zhui, Wang Muyu: "..."</p>

    <p>The scene was embarrassing for a time.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu could only pretend not to know the two of them. He bowed respectfully to them and then sat down in the business class with the Sword Master.</p>

    <p>The matter has come to this. Zhang Zhui can't resist anymore. Having said that...shouldn't his mission on this trip be to find that Maiko Assi? Why are he suddenly tied up to protect Wang Muyu?</p>

    <p>"I'm thinking about a question." At the front of the train, Zhang Zhui crossed his arms and said to Yue Lingwei with a sad look on his face: "Say, this guy is so defiant...why does he need normal people to protect him?"</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei raised his eyebrows. He looked at him and said ruthlessly, "But you don't seem to be a normal person."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he sighed self-deprecatingly: "I'm not even a human being."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "..."</p>

    <p>Maritime high-speed rail. This is a luxury car that Lord Diulei has collected for many years.</p>

    <p>However, it has not been used since it was built. It has been collecting dust on weekdays. This time it was used during sea activities.</p>

    <p>I have to say, the car is really fast!</p>

    <p>They walked ten minutes later than the Immortal Swordsmen of the major cultivation countries. They actually saw their fleet group very quickly.</p>

    <p>"Weird. Our speed is quite fast. But they can't drive so slowly, right?" Zhang Zhui was confused.</p>

    <p>At this time, Yue Lingwei slowed down the car and listened carefully. There was a faint sound of quarreling ahead.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, going on the road together can easily cause disputes.</p>

    <p>Especially when monks from different cultivating countries formed a fleet and sailed together. The harmonious atmosphere of a happy reunion had only been maintained for more than ten minutes, but small regional frictions had already begun to appear.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei can understand the languages of various countries. After listening carefully and sorting out the clues, he gradually understood everything.</p>

    <p>"It's the Curry Country. Their immortal ship broke down. So the overall speed of travel is slowed down."</p>

    <p>"But they... shouldn't have the strength to build an immortal ship, right?"</p>

    <p>Although Zhang Zhui came to modern times not long ago, he has almost completed his knowledge of the composition of the modern world of cultivation. He also has a clear understanding of the roles played by the major countries of cultivation in today's world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Curry Country does not have the strength to manufacture this generation of immortal ships. This is not Zhang Zhui's fault. It is that a large part of their modern cultivation technology does rely on imports. Therefore, the equipment models are also diverse.</p>

    <p>"The immortal ship they are traveling on was purchased from Sun Island. It is native to Sun Island."</p>

    <p>"I see... So after anchoring, they had a quarrel with the monks from Sun Island?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei nodded: "They said there was a problem with the quality of the immortal ship produced by Sun Island. So the monks from Sun Island were dissatisfied. They felt that the monks from the Curry Kingdom who boarded the ship far exceeded the standard, which caused the anchorage to break down. Question. Didn't you see? There are people hanging on the fort."</p>

    <p>"Good guy. Zhenren is still hanging on it..."</p>

    <p>"However, there is a quarrel between three parties now. The other party is the Nanhan monk."</p>

    <p>"Why did they join the fight?"</p>

    <p>"Because they said that the design of Sun Island's immortal sword was copied from Nanhan's. Nanhan has already applied for World Heritage status. Originally, the two monks didn't like each other. This didn't happen, so it sparked a fire."</p>

    <p>"The one who was fighting directly on the ship was..."</p>

    <p>"It's the male monk. He drank too much whiskey and felt there was a bit of noise on the other side. So he went up to beat someone. Didn't you hear? There was a good guy playing music {Katyusha} on the immortal ship next door."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
