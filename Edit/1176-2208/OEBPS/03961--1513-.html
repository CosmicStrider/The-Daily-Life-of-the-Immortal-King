  <h1>Chapter 1513 Little clone</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The little clone in front of me has approximately one trillionth of the power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Wang Ling is worried that the power of the main body is not well controlled.</p>

    <p>Just beat the person into a tofu brain.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I wouldn't test it in this way.</p>

    <p>Little clone.</p>

    <p>It's just a little clone.</p>

    <p>All aspects of attributes appear to be relatively weak for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Calculated according to the level of the clone.</p>

    <p>The real clone. That is something like "Crispy Noodles Dao Lord."</p>

    <p>The level is the highest among the clones currently differentiated by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And the order of clones after "real clone."</p>

    <p>They are: ordinary clone, large clone and finally small clone.</p>

    <p>It differs according to the level of the clone.</p>

    <p>There is also a huge difference in the actual combat power possessed by each clone.</p>

    <p>It's true that the little clone is the weakest.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't expect that even the weakest.</p>

    <p>The damage the other party caused to the little clone turned out to be nothing more than scraping.</p>

    <p>And such a trivial damage.</p>

    <p>The self-healing ability of the mini-clone can also complete the repair in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this level of spiritual power can be completely ignored in Wang Ling's opinion.</p>

    <p>The attack failed. Akano Sekitora's first reaction was also a little unbelievable.</p>

    <p>After a brief daze, he immediately condensed the metal in the nearby space.</p>

    <p>The fish scale-like armor condensed in front of my eyes and roared towards Wang Ling's little clone!</p>

    <p>I have to say. Akano Sekitora is a very outstanding practitioner of the Golden Spiritual Root.</p>

    <p>This is the final means of launching an offensive by extracting rare metals from nearby space.</p>

    <p>If you don't practice this series of magic to a superb level, it is actually very difficult to do it.</p>

    <p>The condensed golden fish scales and iron pieces split the air and made an ear-piercing scream.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the moment when he collided with the little clone, a smoke screen spread out in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Success!"</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora suppressed the fierce glare hidden in his eyes.</p>

    <p>This move is an original move of "Golden Scale Meat Mincer."</p>

    <p>The main inspiration comes from Internet authors who like to procrastinate.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the move is launched, the metal elements in the nearby space will be quickly condensed by him, turning into sharp blades like fish scales...</p>

    <p>A total of hundreds of thousands of fish scales cut the selected target together.</p>

    <p>Under such a storm of blades, it couldn't last more than a few seconds.</p>

    <p>The physical body will turn into a ball of diced meat that is used to make dumplings.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In the smoke screen. Wang Ling's little clone patted the ashes on its body.</p>

    <p>The so-called law of smoke and smoke was once again perfectly demonstrated at this moment.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora is a master. But compared to Wang Ling's clone, it's still not good enough.</p>

    <p>The outline of the little clone is not as tall as the main body. It looks like the size of a ten-year-old child. But the intimidation it exudes is astonishing.</p>

    <p>As soon as the little clone raised his hand, all the smoke screens in the field were swept away.</p>

    <p>The "Golden Scale Meat Mincer" just now has no effect at all on the little clone.</p>

    <p>He walked towards Akano Sekitora step by step.</p>

    <p>The steps made no sound.</p>

    <p>But here, everyone's heart felt like a great bell was vibrating.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui, Akano Sekitora and the silver-skinned human king standing on one side, who had the combat power of ten Lord Diulei, were so scared that they were all terrified in their hearts.</p>

    <p>"Monster! What kind of monster is this!"</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora screamed.</p>

    <p>His unique skills are completely useless.</p>

    <p>This is something Akano Sekitora never expected.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the core hall of the Golden City, there were Akano Sekitora, Jiugong Xinghui and the Silverskin King with ten thunders.</p>

    <p>At the pace of the little clone, quickly retreat.</p>

    <p>The trembling feeling was too strong.</p>

    <p>The little clone hadn't even really taken action yet. It relied on its aura to suppress it. It had already left the three of them unconscious.</p>

    <p>It's just a slight step forward.</p>

    <p>The feeling of blood boiling in the chests of the three people has overflowed. They were all shocked and suffered internal injuries.</p>

    <p>They all said "wow" and vomited blood uniformly.</p>

    <p>No...we must resist!</p>

    <p>Must escape!</p>

    <p>If you don't run, you will die!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, all three of them thought about running away.</p>

    <p>"Hundred Ghosts Night Parade!"</p>

    <p>At this time Jiugong Xinghui shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Jiugong Xinghui had no choice but to pull out a bunch of his hair.</p>

    <p>With a gentle blow, the hall immediately resounded with the screams of many wandering ghosts.</p>

    <p>The art of a hundred ghosts walking at night.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of powerful ghosts are sacrificed and controlled in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>It's kind of like Gao Tianming in the first movie. The way he manipulated hundreds of puppets.</p>

    <p>It's just that the "Hundred Ghosts Night Walk" is not that complicated. Moreover, the spell type is instantaneous. It is still disruptive.</p>

    <p>Especially for other cultivators. I'm afraid it will be difficult to deal with it.</p>

    <p>But now.</p>

    <p>Standing here is the clone of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Such a method. The little clone didn't take it seriously at all.</p>

    <p>I saw the little clone gently raising its hand. The movement of raising the hand was obviously extremely lazy and slow. But it was stunned and directly pinched one of the ghosts running around in the space.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, there was a "bang" and the head of this haunted house was crushed on the spot.</p>

    <p>The spell trap set by the main body also benefits the clone.</p>

    <p>The "one-click cleanup" effect is triggered. Hundreds of wandering ghosts are instantly wiped out.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui seemed to have expected this result.</p>

    <p>She actually didn't know how the little monster in front of her did it.</p>

    <p>But when you see it with your own eyes.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui's already bald scalp even looked a little numb.</p>

    <p>And when Jiugong Xinghui calmed down.</p>

    <p>She was shocked to find that her father and the silver-skinned king who were standing next to her had actually run away!</p>

    <p>On the ground. Akano Sekitora left the last words to Jiugong Xinghui in his own way: "Daughter. Dad will always love you..."</p>

    <p>I love you so much!</p>

    <p>In an instant, she was abandoned by her biological father. Jiugong Xinghui felt despair on her face. She even doubted whether she was Akano Sekitora's biological child.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter if we just leave like this?" The Silverskin King said worriedly, holding his scepter.</p>

    <p>This is a space magic weapon. "Warp Path Jumping War."</p>

    <p>Has the ability to teleport over short distances.</p>

    <p>Just tap the staff lightly to get them out of danger.</p>

    <p>"That person would not kill Xinghui. He would have taken action long ago if he really wanted her life."</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora took out a disc magic weapon and brought up the scene in the core hall.</p>

    <p>This image is projected into the void.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to see how Jiugong Xinghui was doing.</p>

    <p>The result screen showed that Jiugong Xinghui had fallen face to the ground.</p>

    <p>He looked completely fainted.</p>

    <p>The little monster, whose outline could only be seen clearly, slowly stood up from the ground and suddenly looked in the direction of the surveillance camera. It seemed that he was "looking at each other affectionately" with Akano Sekitora.</p>

    <p>Just the next moment.</p>

    <p>Whether it was Akano Sekitora or the Silverskin King. Their smiles completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Because it is in the scene of emptiness.</p>

    <p>The little monster stretched out his hand directly towards them.</p>

    <p>The small palm penetrated directly from the screen and pinched his head...</p>
