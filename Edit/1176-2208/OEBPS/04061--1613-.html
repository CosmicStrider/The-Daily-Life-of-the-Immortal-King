  <h1>Chapter 1613: Hitting the wall on both sides</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the incident at Jiugong's house was resolved. All the pressure and anxiety that Junko Zhongchun had been carrying was completely lifted.</p>

    <p>She was unwilling to betray Jiugong Liangzi, but because her only family was threatened, she was constantly taken advantage of by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>When Jiugong Liangzi discovered the clues, Junko Zhongchun once wanted to commit suicide and bid farewell to this world.</p>

    <p>But for Jiugong Liangzi, the meaning of Junko Zhongchun is different.</p>

    <p>Not just her own female bodyguard.</p>

    <p>They are also friends and relatives who have grown up with her since childhood.</p>

    <p>After the suicide attempt, after a period of adjustment, Junko Zhongchun got back on track.</p>

    <p>Although Shou Chong's phone number was marked "Princess Taiping", it was actually just the number of his work phone. Junko Zhongchun will re-screen all incoming work calls and only deliver the information after confirming that it is not a scam or blackmail message.</p>

    <p>"It's a call from Master Shou Chong. He said that the magic weapon that can trace the dead fish-eyed boy has been researched. I hope Miss Liangzi can meet in private." In Jiugong Liangzi's villa, Junko Zhongchun stood respectfully beside the luxurious leather sofa. said.</p>

    <p>Today is a rare day for Jiugong Liangzi to go home. After all, he usually lives at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This time when I go home, I mainly pack some clothes and daily necessities.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi has decided to move in with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She was in a good mood. Then she heard Junko's words.</p>

    <p>I just remembered that I had actually invested 5 billion in Shou Chong's research.</p>

    <p>But now, for Jiugong Liangzi, it seems that it doesn't matter whether he can find the dead fish-eyed boy or not.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, she wanted to find that boy with dead fish eyes. To prove that Zhuo Yi was a liar.</p>

    <p>But now, that is no longer necessary.</p>

    <p>"This is no longer important. Junko, go and tell Master Shou Chong. Thank you for your hard work." Jiugong Liangzi took care of his smooth and smooth hair. He replied after thinking carefully.</p>

    <p>Junko Zhongchun was stunned: "The five billion funds..."</p>

    <p>"Sent to him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"People always have to pay for their own willfulness." Jiugong Liangzi finished speaking. His cheeks turned slightly red.</p>

    <p>"..." Junko Zhongchun was speechless.</p>

    <p>Is this the legendary "inhumanity"... Just don't want it.</p>

    <p>However, with the strong financial resources of the Jiugong family, they have now successfully entered into cooperation with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Although this news has not been announced to the public, a mere five billion is really nothing now. It can be regarded as funding the scientific and technological development of human cultivators.</p>

    <p>In fact, every year the Jiugong family allocates a large sum of money to those talented scientists in the cultivation world for research.</p>

    <p>Some studies are successful, but more often fail.</p>

    <p>If he only did it with the idea of giving back to the society, Jiugong Liangzi would not care about the money at all.</p>

    <p>At this time, Junko Zhongchun let go of the call port of the phone. With a somewhat apologetic look on his face, he said with a smile: "So... did Master Shou Chong hear it?"</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "No Ms. Junko. That's 5 billion dollars in R&amp;D... Five billion dollars! Are you sure you don't want it?"</p>

    <p>Junko Zhongchun: "Sorry Master Shou Chong. It's Miss's decision. If you are not sure. If you are worried that the Jiugong family will back out later, Ms. Jiugong said she could draft a separate research termination and donation agreement. And it will be stated that the termination is due to her personal reasons. It won't affect your reputation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Thus. The call is disconnected.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was staggered in his chair. It was hard to find peace in his heart for a long time.</p>

    <p>To give away $5 billion just like that... Shou Chong never expected this.</p>

    <p>"Teacher. This Jiugong family is too generous... What should we do now?" The plan was disrupted. The assistants in the lab were all at a loss as to what to do.</p>

    <p>One of the assistants suddenly thought of something and said, "Why don't we try. Exchange of information?"</p>

    <p>"Exchange of intelligence?" Shou Chong wondered.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it true that Jiugong Liangzi, the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family, and the eldest daughter of the Huaguo Shuilian Group are at odds with each other."</p>

    <p>"I think it would be better to take this gossip. And make a deal with Miss Sun. Then let Miss Sun come forward. Give us a chance to meet Mr. Zhuo Yi alone." The assistant said, "That Zhuo Yi legend. He was her senior."</p>

    <p>"That's a good idea..." Shou Chong nodded.</p>

    <p>I think what this assistant said makes sense.</p>

    <p>You know, in order to oppose Jiugong Liangzi, Sun Rong invested 15 billion in him!</p>

    <p>Shou Chong heard that even the core members of the group noticed it at that time, and even signed a gambling agreement. If the magic weapon develops and develops at a loss, Sun Rong will give up its inheritance rights.</p>

    <p>Compared to Jiugong Liangzi. Sun Rong, there is actually no other way out. It is also impossible to give up the money directly.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong thinks. Maybe it's an opportunity.</p>

    <p>So he quickly took out his mobile phone and found the phone number of Sun Rong from the address book.</p>

    <p>Name note: Sun Rong Dad.</p>

    <p>"Master Shou Chong's magic weapon has been developed, right? That's great." From the other side of the phone came the dignified laughter of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Across the screen, Shou Chong could picture the girl sitting on the sofa, sipping tea and talking to him on the phone.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss Sun. The research below is very reliable. It can perfectly counter the magic weapon Miss Jiugong asked to develop to find dead fish eyes. This is a projection magic weapon with radiation function. It is called the Apparition Device."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong introduced: "You need to wear an earring as a receiver. Then through the magic weapon in your hand, you can make your face change into what you want. You can even customize celebrity faces individually. My experimental team has been upgraded Core chip. Ordinary transfiguration detection equipment. It cannot detect faces modified by the transfiguration device."</p>

    <p>"That's great. It sounds very practical." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>In this era where beauty cameras and various magical makeup techniques are frequently used, the emergence of such a "Apparition Apparatus" is definitely a blessing to the entire society.</p>

    <p>It is true that Sun Rong originally asked Shou Chong to develop the magic weapon to target Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong did not expect that what Shou Chong developed this time would actually have unexpected selling points.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Miss. This is what we should do."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong smiled. Then he started to talk about the next topic: "That's it, Miss Sun Rong. I'm looking for you this time. There is another thing..."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"I have some information about Miss Jiugong here. I wonder if Miss Sun Rong is interested? Of course. In exchange for information, we also have certain conditions."</p>

    <p>"You mean Jiugong Liangzi's information?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Oh...I'm not interested in that." Sun Rong smiled and said, "Besides, Liangzi is a good person. The information is basically not too complicated."</p>

    <p>"???" Shou Chong was stunned.</p>

    <p>Aren't you two really unwilling to deal with each other?</p>
