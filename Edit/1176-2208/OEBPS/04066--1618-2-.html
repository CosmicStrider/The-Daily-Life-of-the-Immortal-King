  <h1>Chapter 1618 The daily life of the eternal boss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wei Zhi rubbed his forehead deeply. Although Zhuo Yi had already told him that senior Zhang Zhui had a dark history of stealing things.</p>

    <p>But if you don't correct this problem in modern cultivation society, you will still be captured and jailed... and petty theft is considered a low-level behavior even if you are placed in Songhai City Number 1 Prison.</p>

    <p>Even if Zhang Zhui really goes in, he, an eternally strong man, may not have much face.</p>

    <p>After all, it was impossible to be locked up with the mahjong trio who had made spectacular mistakes.</p>

    <p>At the entrance of the coffee shop, Wei Zhi ordered two iced lattes. Then he patiently carried out legal education, criticism and education for Zhang Zhui in front of the coffee shop.</p>

    <p>"Senior, don't think I'm verbose. If you don't correct this problem, you will have big problems in the future." Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui stirred the straw in his hand and sucked the iced latte in his hand. This was his first time drinking coffee. It felt great.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that he suddenly felt that Wei Zhi was cute.</p>

    <p>It's really rare to see juniors like this who are so interesting and patient.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui's nature is actually not bad. Except for the fact that his habit of stealing things is difficult to correct in a short period of time, he is not shy about admitting his mistakes.</p>

    <p>Now he and Li Xian live under someone else's roof. The landlord is Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Although Wei Zhi's age is very different from theirs.</p>

    <p>But when three of us are together, there must be someone who is my teacher.</p>

    <p>They need to be familiar with modern social life. They still need to rely on Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in a sense, Wei Zhi is also the master of Zhang Zhui, Li Xian and others.</p>

    <p>After obediently listening to Wei Zhi's criticism and education, Zhang Zhui also drank the last latte in his hand. Then he looked at Wei Zhi with a stern look: "Give the money back. Then you can make meritorious deeds, right?"</p>

    <p>"Dedicate one's crime to meritorious deeds?" Wei Zhi didn't understand what it meant.</p>

    <p>"Where are there more pickpockets?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>A crowded place where there are many pickpockets and they are easy to steal.</p>

    <p>The first thing Wei Zhi thought of was the subway station.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is the way to go.</p>

    <p>It happened that the Spiritual Beast Market they were going to was originally connected by bus to subway.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the purpose of educating Zhang Zhui on the way, they might have already taken the subway.</p>

    <p>"Senior, do you want to catch a thief?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi suddenly laughed. He thought Zhang Zhui's idea was very good, but he thought it was not that easy: "Thieves nowadays are very good. And they have to be caught first. This is not easy."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I'll take care of it. If I can catch 10 today, just buy me another cup of this. What's this called?"</p>

    <p>"Iced latte."</p>

    <p>"eh... iced latte. If you have this, that's enough."</p>

    <p>"If senior can really catch 10, I will buy two cups for senior." Wei Zhi suddenly found it interesting.</p>

    <p>"It's a deal." Zhang Zhui nodded.</p>

    <p>Then, the two of them got up and walked towards the Line 8 subway station.</p>

    <p>At the same time, those little thieves who are lurking in the subway still don't know what will happen next...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui is known as the "father of Che Guevara" throughout the ages. He has long been labeled as the eternal thief.</p>

    <p>But this label is too old. The past is hard to look back on. Even Zhang Zhui is not far away from recalling it.</p>

    <p>There is a lyric called "I have not been a big brother for many years."</p>

    <p>And Zhang Zhui has been trapped in the Corpse Map for so long. After so many years... it seems that he has left behind the long-lost nickname of "The Thief."</p>

    <p>At this moment, he changed into modern clothes. He stood in the crowd wearing the slim casual sweatshirt Wei Zhi prepared for him.</p>

    <p>No one can imagine it.</p>

    <p>This ordinary-looking uncle is a bandit leader...</p>

    <p>"Can we really catch him?" Wei Zhi stood next to Zhang Zhui, feeling particularly curious.</p>

    <p>Because catching a thief is a job that needs to be carried out smoothly without delaying your own schedule.</p>

    <p>Ten pickpockets. That's not a lot, but it's actually a lot.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of pickpockets in subway stations, but most of them are very cautious.</p>

    <p>Some people don't take action. There's nothing you can do about them.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment he entered the subway station, Zhang Zhui's "thief radar" was already activated.</p>

    <p>Just looking around, he cracked open and locked in many suspects.</p>

    <p>However, these thieves are relatively scattered. Zhang Zhui cannot directly attack them in groups before catching the current situation.</p>

    <p>But he had another way.</p>

    <p>"Did you see the man wearing a silver watch in front of you?" Zhang Xi whispered in Wei Zhi's ear without squinting.</p>

    <p>"Ah. Found it so quickly?" Wei Zhi couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"Don't stare. Otherwise it will make him suspicious." After Zhang Zhui explained, Wei Zhi immediately looked away.</p>

    <p>Although I just glanced at it.</p>

    <p>But Wei Zhi really found it hard to believe that the man wearing a silver watch and looking like a white-collar elite could actually be a pickpocket.</p>

    <p>Pickpockets are good at disguising themselves.</p>

    <p>Throughout the ages, there have been many people who have worn bright and beautiful Taoist robes, dressed themselves up as celebrities in the world of cultivation and made friends everywhere, and then waited for opportunities to go to other people's homes to commit petty crimes...</p>

    <p>This old tradition was passed down by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it has been continued in modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Once you get here...</p>

    <p>Saw these modern counterparts. Oh no... pickpockets.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui actually felt like he was home.</p>

    <p>As a bandit, the behavior of these people is too childish in Zhang Zhui's eyes.</p>

    <p>"The number is enough." Zhang Zhui used his thieves radar to analyze a wave of scattered pickpockets in the subway station. Zhang Zhui knew what he was doing.</p>

    <p>He felt that he could exceed his target.</p>

    <p>After about a few seconds, he started to say loudly to Wei Zhi: "How could anyone go to the bank with such a big bag of gold coins?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he shook the box of coins he had just brought from the bus. In fact, these were not gold coins at all. It was just what Zhang Zhui said casually.</p>

    <p>"Sorry... sorry..." Wei Zhi looked at this sudden scene and was stunned. Then he quickly touched the back of his head. He almost didn't respond.</p>

    <p>But he quickly understood Zhang Zhui's intention.</p>

    <p>This is "crowd ridicule."</p>

    <p>I said this deliberately so that the pickpockets nearby who heard it would gather together.</p>

    <p>As expected.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui and Wei Zhi boarded the subway, the pickpockets that Zhang Zhui had targeted earlier followed the subway one after another.</p>

    <p>Some are single operators, while others are gangs committing crimes.</p>

    <p>As soon as they entered the subway, Wei Zhi and Zhang Zhui were surrounded by a gang of pickpockets.</p>

    <p>This is to deceive others.</p>

    <p>So that those outstretched thieves' hands can go unnoticed.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui deliberately held his bag of coins in his hand.</p>

    <p>One minute after the subway started running normally, he felt a few pairs of thieves' hands starting to move...</p>

    <p>"Eight hands?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't help but chuckle to himself.</p>

    <p>He thought this was too childish.</p>

    <p>As a thief.</p>

    <p>He actually had a title back then.</p>

    <p>Called.</p>

    <p>Thousand-Hand Guanyin...</p>

    <p>"Everyone, don't you think it's a bit excessive for so many of you to attack the old man?" At this moment, in the silent subway, Zhang Zhui suddenly spoke up.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi felt that doing so was a bit misleading.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Zhang Zhui put the bag of coins he was holding on the ground.</p>

    <p>This bag of money seemed to be attractive. The moment it landed, it attracted the hands of several thieves nearby to land at the same time...</p>

    <p>The pickpockets all made strange noises like "Ya!"</p>

    <p>Then all the money fell to the ground along with the bag of money that landed on the ground...</p>

    <p>They found that their hands were stuck to the bag of money.</p>

    <p>I can't pull it out...</p>
