  <h1>Chapter 1599 Old Uncle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The one thousand five hundred and ninety-nineth time...</p>

    <p>In the extra timeline, when Fenmu Shen recorded the number of his deaths, his body was exhausted and his face showed a look of despair.</p>

    <p>The inescapable fate heralds a kind of decline and end for him. No matter how hard he struggles, it is all in vain. This is the most frightening thing.</p>

    <p>It doesn't make sense...</p>

    <p>That's not true!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen roared.</p>

    <p>He is obviously the god who controls time and space. How could he be manipulated by an earthling?</p>

    <p>In anger, he moved time forward again and changed the world he was in.</p>

    <p>This is a brand new world line. He firmly believes that as long as his choices are different from before, he will be able to change his fate of having his heart ripped out by Wang Ling through the butterfly effect...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen jumped back to the time when he sent the ancient divine soldiers to rescue Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>According to that timeline, Peng Xiren's soul was later forcibly brought back to his residence by Zheng. And he relied on Peng Xiren's physical body. He cast a spell to open the celestial tomb with the memory of Peng Xiren's physical body.</p>

    <p>What if...</p>

    <p>If he hadn't done that at the beginning, maybe the ending would have changed.</p>

    <p>So this time.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen stood still.</p>

    <p>He chose to continue hiding in the Devouring Star. If he hadn't opened the Sky Tomb, hadn't inherited the bloodline of the Outer God Sotos... but had continued to stay here honestly, maybe nothing would have happened.</p>

    <p>However, what Fenmu Shen didn't expect was that even on this world line, the boy from Earth would still find him quickly.</p>

    <p>There was despair on Fenmu Shen's face.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling without saying a word, dug out Fenmu Shen's heart...</p>

    <p>Is even this timeline controlled...</p>

    <p>When Fenmu Shen opened his eyes again, time returned to the time when he became an Outer God.</p>

    <p>Just when he made up his mind and prepared to continue jumping, a voice suddenly sounded from his mind.</p>

    <p>"It's useless. You can't deal with him...his methods. I know all too well." It was a very young voice.</p>

    <p>What surprised Fenmu Shen was that this voice actually sounded directly in his mind.</p>

    <p>Direct spiritual intervention?</p>

    <p>What a joke...</p>

    <p>Even if he is bullied by Wang Ling, when will someone other than Wang Ling be able to ride on his head?</p>

    <p>He tried to purify his spirit and force the voice out of his mind.</p>

    <p>However, he was met with a sneer from this mysterious voice: "You don't have to be like this. If you don't want to cooperate, I can leave on my own. But if you and I don't join forces, the probability of defeating him is almost zero."</p>

    <p>These words made Fenmu Shen calm down a bit. He had been killed by Wang Ling too many times. It was when his thinking was confused and he needed someone to guide him.</p>

    <p>Faced with the sudden sound, although he felt furious, he also felt as if he had grasped a life-saving straw.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..."</p>

    <p>"Someone who has the same problem as you."</p>

    <p>The voice laughed and said: "That person erased everything about me from the universe... but he didn't expect that my will transcended everything. He survived with strong resentment..."</p>

    <p>"You have no body?"</p>

    <p>"I have become a transcendent existence. I do not need to rely on the physical body to survive."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Several conversations. Fenmu Shen was always suspicious.</p>

    <p>He didn't completely believe what the voice said. But the other party's existence was indeed extremely strange.</p>

    <p>Because during the conversation, Fenmu Shen tried to find the source of this spirit. However, he found that the other party was not incorporeal. His tracking signal was directly distributed to the entire universe along a strange route...</p>

    <p>"How about. Do you want to cooperate?"</p>

    <p>At this moment. Fenmu Shen was silent. The voice was still urging: "I will help you. I'll help you get the rest of the secret objects..."</p>

    <p>"Did you say. Destiny?" Fenmu Shen was half-convinced.</p>

    <p>"The part you received did not fully allow you to inherit the power of Sotos. It is far from the heyday of Sotos.</p>

    <p>There is still a certain gap."...</p>

    <p>Cosmic Embryo is a strange thing that Wang Ling has never seen before. Natural magic weapons like this kind of cultivation are actually rare.</p>

    <p>And. Wang Ling discovered that this Cosmic Embryo seemed to have the effect of absorbing excess energy from his body.</p>

    <p>But both Zhang Zhui and Li Xian said that after Cosmic Embryo develops, it will no longer have this ability to absorb excess energy.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling's plan to use Cosmic Embryo to control the body's excess energy failed. We still have to wait until Wang Ming uses the strange black stone to research the new seal Talisman.</p>

    <p>But this is still a very special harvest for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At least during the time when Cosmic Embryo was developing and forming, there was finally something else to share the excess psychic energy in his body with the original seal Talisman on his body. This helped Wang Ling better control his power.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling keeps the postpartum fetus in its own spiritual space. The powerful spiritual space provides Cosmic Embryo with great nutrients.</p>

    <p>For Cosmic Embryo. This is a mud pot with excellent nutritional content.</p>

    <p>In the vast spiritual space of Wang Ling, which is like another universe. After Cosmic Embryo settled down, it began to emit a golden ripple. It was using its own energy to test the scope of this new universe.</p>

    <p>As a result, Cosmic Embryo trembled slightly... because this space was so big. It had almost no edge or end.</p>

    <p>In reality, for the first time, a golden vertical eye appeared naturally between Wang Ling's eyebrows. It appeared like a mark between his two sword-shaped eyebrows. It was easy to see the difference with those dead eyes. Fish eyes are out of place.</p>

    <p>But Cosmic Embryo is too mysterious. Ordinary people cannot see this eye.</p>

    <p>Even Sun Rong, who is said to be the world's number one Foundation Building in terms of combat power, can't see Wang Ling's inner eye.</p>

    <p>After all, what the girl relies on is the sword energy blessed by the fusion of Aohai human swords. It is not her original state.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling feels that it should be a good thing that Sun Rong doesn't know about this.</p>

    <p>Cosmic Embryo is originally a thing that appeared in the ancient universe era. It is related to those cruel Old Dominators. It may be very dangerous to be connected with these evil things.</p>

    <p>"I wonder what amazing changes this Cosmic Embryo will have after it is fully formed..."</p>

    <p>"This thing may not necessarily be a good thing. It is also difficult to control it. At present, it seems that only someone of Ling Zhenren's level can control it stably."</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui looked at each other. They were the only ones among the Eternal Powerhouses who had heard about Cosmic Embryo. They were also the ones with the most extensive experience.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling plans to reuse the two of them in the future.</p>

    <p>Here, it was about to be Wang Ling's turn to play. Wang Ling pinched his fingers to calculate the course of the game.</p>

    <p>Then he frowned.</p>

    <p>Because he counted on the "Jiugong family" side. It seems that someone is still trying to make a move...trying to take action against Sun Rong who pretends to be Jiugong Liangzi in this game.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling just wants to compete and get bonuses. He doesn't care about other unnecessary things.</p>

    <p>He felt that such small things could be done for him by the eternal warriors in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>So. After Wang Ling conveyed the whole matter to Li Xian through spiritual thoughts.</p>

    <p>Li Xian's eyes immediately lit up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to give him the key to freely enter and leave the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>This was something Li Xian never expected.</p>

    <p>Like other Eternal-level experts, Li Xian was a witness who watched Wang Ling beat Fenmu Shen. Wang Ling had an order. He naturally had a willing-to-die attitude.</p>

    <p>He immediately knelt down and kowtowed: "Don't worry, Ling Zhenren. I'll leave this matter to you. I'll do it beautifully."</p>

    <p>And the other side.</p>

    <p>Those Jiugong family members who were planning to deal with Jiugong Liangzi also never expected it.</p>

    <p>The person who is about to come to Jiugong's house is a strong man from all ages.</p>

    <p>And Li Xian did not do any other unnecessary things during this trip.</p>

    <p>I was just sent by Wang Ling to handle the Jiugong family's housework...</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that the eternal master back then would be transformed into the new and old uncle by Wang Ling in the blink of an eye.</p>
