  <h1>Chapter 2156 Undercover Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Four Elephants have been doing a lot of evil and most of the fugitives are fleeing overseas. It is very difficult to capture them.</p>

    <p>After all, they are the disciples brought out by Evil Sword God. Evil Sword God knows them all. According to Evil Sword God's confession, Qing Jiao, Xue Hu, Zhu Qi, Xiong Wu all had strong counter-surveillance awareness, so it wouldn't be easy to catch them.</p>

    <p>Especially since the capture of Evil Sword God. According to the research of the overseas criminal pursuit team at the cultivation Police Station, the pursuit team is sure that they have never come back.</p>

    <p>The capture of Evil Sword God is a warning to them. But just because he hasn't come back at this stage doesn't mean he won't find an opportunity to come back in the future.</p>

    <p>The cultivation Police Station has been worried that maybe the Four Elephants are planning some big plan. For example, they could rescue the Evil Sword God after a prison robbery.</p>

    <p>This is what the Cultivation Police Department is most worried about. A prison break is not the worst thing; what they fear is that the people who break in are all madmen, and madmen who have a plan.</p>

    <p>If they really decide to set out to rescue the Evil Sword God, then the pressure on the cultivation Police Station will be even greater.</p>

    <p>Therefore, instead of feeling anxious all the time, it is better to take action early and capture several people together.</p>

    <p>For this reason, the cultivation Police Station had already contacted Huaxiu Alliance for assistance. Huaxiu Alliance also took the initiative to find the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>So now Zhuo Yi has entered the game as a GM. Cooperating with Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi who teamed up to lock the specific IP coordinates of these four people.</p>

    <p>Even a few people entering the game to assist in the development of Wang Ling, Sun Rong are secondary tasks. The current main task is to locate the real IP coordinates of several people.</p>

    <p>After the capture is completed, the task of assisting the development of Wang Ling and Sun Rong will naturally become the next main task.</p>

    <p>You would never imagine how cautious a group of extremely vicious criminals could be at this juncture.</p>

    <p>"Why does it need to be so complicated? Wasn't it said that the game cabin of the Itinerant Immortal has a crime monitoring system?"</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said in confusion: "Once a criminal is found playing this game, the game chamber can be sealed off directly, releasing the crispy gas. While the criminal still thinks he is playing the game, the game chamber can be launched from the spot and transported to the designated location."</p>

    <p>"But these are things that would happen in an ideal world, aren't they?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong raised his eyebrows and said: "This group of people faced such a long pursuit by the Cultivation Police Department. From the overseas pursuit team to the help of the International Cultivation Criminal Police. There has been no news for so many years. This proves that they are more thoughtful than us. You need to be too cautious."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi touched his chin and nodded slightly: "Brother Qin is right. If it were me, I would not enter the game cabin by myself. Instead, I would place a dummy inside first, and then use other magical means to establish a neural link between the dummy and the main body. That way, even outside the game pod, I could still play the game normally. The key is that I wouldn't be controlled by the game pod anymore."</p>

    <p>"Then these people have worked hard just to be able to play the game..."</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Li Ziye was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>In order to play a game, you need to make a fake ID card, make a fake stand-in, and establish a neural link... This is not something that ordinary monks can do with enough time, right?</p>

    <p>"Alright, I agree. But let me make this clear first, this is purely a friendly favor, based on the basic principles of being a good citizen." Li Ziye said reluctantly.</p>

    <p>Although he is basically in a state of "doing no evil" in the game, he can return to his human nature and is not bad either.</p>

    <p>Just like Li Ziye said. This is just a game after all.</p>

    <p>So sometimes you really don't have to worry too much.</p>

    <p>"If the capture goes well, you will get a banner and a commendation order from Huaxiu Alliance." Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"Really!?" Li Ziye was moved.</p>

    <p>This is something he can use to brag for the rest of his life!</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance's Commendation Order!</p>

    <p>There is no need to say more about the gold content of this thing!</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I will definitely introduce you two!" At this time, Li Ziye blew through his nose and patted his chest suddenly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after returning to the Four Elephants Guild, Xiong Wu has been in a very low mood.</p>

    <p>Many guild members kept silent. They knew the character of their guild leader. He had always been a very strong person. This time he was disgraced in Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>It's obvious that Xiong Wu will get his revenge no matter what.</p>

    <p>In the real world. In the conference room. Qing Jiao, Xue Hu, Zhu Qi, and Xiong Wu are having a meeting.</p>

    <p>They removed the neuron data line interface with the dummy in the game cabin and conducted private meetings directly in the real world.</p>

    <p>The main content of today's meeting: How to take revenge on Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>A slender young man with a whip made a cold voice: "Brother, you know me. I always believe in settling scores on the spot, and I suspect that the city lord is definitely not an NPC. His words and actions are highly likely to be those of a real player."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Xiong Wu looked at Xue Hu again.</p>

    <p>Xue Hu straightened his powerful body and said: "Brother, you know me. I always pick on the weak. Since everyone wants to go to Fuyun Town, and Fuyun Town is protected by that city lord who may or may not be an NPC, why don't we set up checkpoints around Fuyun Town and intercept all the players who want to go there!"</p>

    <p>Then, Xiong Wu looked at Zhu Qi again.</p>

    <p>Zhu's voice was long and thin, with the feeling of a smile hiding a knife: "Brother, you know me. In fact, I have the same opinion as Qing Jiao. That person's blood is too thick. From a game perspective, we won't be able to fight him in the short term. If this person is a real person, it will be much easier for us..."</p>

    <p>"Go on. "</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu showed an interesting expression.</p>

    <p>Zhu sighed and said: "Brother, my method is still very simple. Since we can't deal with the people in the game, let's deal with the people outside the game. If he is a real person, then we can deal with him directly. Qing Jiao has resources in this area. If we assume that this person is real, maybe we can directly find the coordinates of this person. Then we can ask Qing Jiao to hack into the system."</p>

    <p>"But wouldn't this be too risky?" Xiong Wu frowned.</p>

    <p>Zhu waved his hand and said with a smile: "When did the elder brother become so timid? If the elder brother is really worried, I can use my sword energy to track it remotely. As long as it is touched by my sword energy, no matter what the object is, it will become an explosive object!"</p>

    <p>"It's better to be cautious first. And we must be prepared for everything."</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu slapped the table: "Do it! Find this person! Kill him!"</p>
