  <h1>Chapter 1258 The illusion of invincibility</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A long time ago. Wang Ling summarized several major misconceptions about combat.</p>

    <p>For example: This trick works. He is sweating because I must have scared him. This person is very young and not very experienced. It shouldn't be difficult to deal with him. Although I couldn't beat him before, I have become stronger and the battle has just begun. He He will definitely lose the first matchup...</p>

    <p>Now facing a comeback, President Bai's self-confidence has turned into a vain one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also summarized several major illusions about invincibility in view of the excessive "arrogance."</p>

    <p>He is very aware of Xu Bai's inner psychological activities.</p>

    <p>For example: The top of the immortal, proud of the world. With me, there will be heaven after all!</p>

    <p>Another example: Heaven does not give birth to a virtuous son. Eternity is like a long night...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. These domineering declarations are now placed on Xu Bai. They seem so ridiculous to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And obviously, the scarier thing is not knowing it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed slightly. He was the first to send Zhuo Yi out of the battlefield.</p>

    <p>Because he heard the sound of sirens coming from beyond the limits of the void.</p>

    <p>It is impossible that such a huge amount of psychic energy fluctuations would not attract the attention of the police.</p>

    <p>So he sent Zhuo Yi out first, leaving Zhuo Yi to stabilize the situation. At the same time, he organized police forces to disperse the surrounding people.</p>

    <p>But I have one thing to say. Wang Ling feels that the battle here will be resolved soon.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the person I like. He can actually send people out of my void."</p>

    <p>Looking at the scene in front of him, although Xu Bai was surprised, he was more excited.</p>

    <p>According to normal logical thinking, once you fall into the limit of his void, it is impossible to get rid of it so easily.</p>

    <p>But in front of me, Wang Ling chose to send Zhuo Yi away.</p>

    <p>From Xu Bai's point of view, it was simply a touching drama of life and death.</p>

    <p>He felt that Wang Ling must have paid a heavy price before sending Zhuo Yi out of his void realm, leaving the hope of life to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>In this regard, Xu Bai expressed his own evaluation after sighing a few times: "You treat your disciples well. I am very touched."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this person is completely hopeless.</p>

    <p>In fact. Wang Ling came prepared for this trip.</p>

    <p>He summarized the lessons learned from his last battle with President Bai in Chapter 690.</p>

    <p>Because he was dragged into a fight before he finished his homework. The whole process made Wang Ling uneasy.</p>

    <p>So this time. Wang Ling rushed to the scene after finishing all the homework.</p>

    <p>Secondly, he had been worried that President Bai would damage his school uniform during the last fight.</p>

    <p>The school uniform was damaged. He had to deduct money from his pocket money to buy a new one.</p>

    <p>So after the last session, Wang Ling went home and decorated all the clothes she wore.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that Wang Ling is now standing in the boundary of the void. The clothes on his body were not torn to pieces by the huge tearing force from the upper and lower sides.</p>

    <p>On the other side, facing a familiar opponent.</p>

    <p>President Bai also summed up the lessons learned based on the previous experience.</p>

    <p>Before he became Xu Bai, his self-healing ability was his biggest trump card. So before the battle began, he had designated a consumption strategy. He planned to consume all the boy's physical strength and finally counterattack.</p>

    <p>But the young President Bai didn't know that even the most basic slap from the boy had the effect of serious injury.</p>

    <p>After being slapped, he was hit so hard that he had no energy left to fight back.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in this battle, after he advanced to become Xubai, his new tactic was to use his advantages of void creatures to suppress fire!</p>

    <p>Void creatures do not need to consider the issue of spiritual energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Their energy source comes from the void. And the energy of the void is inexhaustible!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the two of them were separated in the void. After looking at each other for a few seconds, they each had their own thoughts in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai held the cane. When he raised his sleeves, endless void energy groups appeared in the void!</p>

    <p>These large and small energy groups appeared around Wang Ling almost instantly. They were like the abyss of a wild beast. In an instant, the water surrounding Wang Ling was blocked.</p>

    <p>For a moment. Wang Ling felt like he was trapped in an ocean ball.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened King's Eyes. The three-petal Golden Lotus bloomed in his vagina. His entire pupils were painted with the color of a black hole.</p>

    <p>The huge devouring ability begins to show!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's King's Eyes turned into the mouth of the giant beast at this moment, absorbing all the energy groups nearby!</p>

    <p>Faced with such high-energy and highly dense void energy groups, this is the best way Wang Ling can think of. If he were to forcefully destroy it, the big explosions produced by these energy groups would probably be enough to cause damage to Songhai City, even if they were residual power. A devastating blow.</p>

    <p>He neutralized his move in an understatement. Xubai's brain went blank again just like last time.</p>

    <p>He has become a more advanced life form!</p>

    <p>Perhaps even Xu Bai himself didn't realize it. Fine beads of sweat had begun to flow from his forehead.</p>

    <p>The opponent could actually absorb all of his void energy group with just his physical strength?</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>This is absolutely impossible!</p>

    <p>At this time, Xu Bai, who did not believe in evil, turned the scepter again!</p>

    <p>His power of void is inexhaustible. He does not believe that Wang Ling can infinitely swallow up his energy group...</p>

    <p>"It's so troublesome."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling had to repeat the previous round of operations. Once again, King's Eyes was used to absorb the energy group.</p>

    <p>Eh... Although Xu Bai is too arrogant, he actually guessed one thing right. That is, the capacity of King's Eyes is actually limited. It is impossible to absorb energy groups without limit. Once the space is full. Wang Ling must find a way to release the energy accumulated in King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>But at this level, it actually takes a long time to reach full capacity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood in the field bored, watching Xu Bai's boring performance.</p>

    <p>After observing for a while, he became a little impatient.</p>

    <p>Thinking of having to take online classes tomorrow, the complicated emotions suddenly came to Wang Ling's heart.</p>

    <p>The so-called suspension of classes does not stop learning.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling is at home, he still has to take online classes.</p>

    <p>Not only that. The school also stipulates that every student must shoot a learning video and send it to the class group.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly adds a lot of trouble to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In this way, he won't be able to let the two monsters, the pen and the eraser, do the homework for him.</p>

    <p>And the reason why he was stuck at home taking online classes? Isn't the culprit Xu Bai standing in front of him?</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, every wrongdoer has his own debtor.</p>

    <p>At this moment, I thought about Wang Ling, who would have to take online classes tomorrow. I could no longer suppress the urge to slap Xubai to death...</p>

    <p>The same scene as last time. He walked towards Xu Bai step by step.</p>

    <p>But compared to the last battle, Xubai has indeed become stronger.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cannot guarantee whether one slap will kill him directly.</p>

    <p>But he still walked up to Xu Bai and raised his hand.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai sneered: "All physical attacks are ineffective against me. The moment your slap hits me, I will be completely swallowed by the void..."</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>The next moment, a firm slap was slapped on Xu Bai's face.</p>

    <p>The pale head moved away from the body and disappeared...</p>

    <p>This is just an ordinary slap.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't seem to have the one-shot killing effect that Wang Ling wanted.</p>

    <p>He felt that Xubai's aura had not completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, in the next meeting, the pale head grew back again...</p>

    <p>This situation made Wang Ling understand clearly.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the head is not the key point.</p>

    <p>It seems that the next slap will make him change his position...</p>
