  <h1>Chapter 1745 Dream Linkage</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although it has been agreed with Wang Muyu, in fact Wang Ling has no plans to raise a child... The final exam is coming soon. It is the crucial score-breaking stage of the year. He cannot let go. Don't study to take care of your baby.</p>

    <p>Besides, this child is really not his! It just looks exactly like him!</p>

    <p>However, because he had already established a good relationship with Wang Muyu, Wang Ling thought that if it was his turn to visit Wang Muyu, he might be able to send a clone there.</p>

    <p>Who would have known that this little guy had already understood his true thoughts. He had to tell Sun Rong to Wang Ling several days in advance. He was not allowed to send clones to fool him. Otherwise, he would go directly to the Huaguo Shuilian Group's TV stations around the world. Broadcasting that he is the son of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked immediately after hearing it.</p>

    <p>This little guy even threatened him...</p>

    <p>He has never been threatened by others since he was a child. He has always been a threat to others...</p>

    <p>Does this little guy really not care what happens if he blows up and destroys the earth?</p>

    <p>Later Wang Ling changed his mind and thought that maybe Wang Muyu really didn't care. Because the genetic cells in his body were originally taken from the Dragon Clan... and the Dragon Clan's biggest wish is to regain the hegemony of the universe.</p>

    <p>Of course, in this matter, the happiest person and the person who benefited the most may still be Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Because there have been more text messages between her and Wang Ling in the past few days.</p>

    <p>Although every time Wang Ling takes a long time to reply. And even if he does reply, it is just a series of simple ellipses or just a few words.</p>

    <p>But because of Wang Muyu's relationship, Sun Rong felt that he and Wang Ling had finally found a way to communicate other than "dry noodles" and "study."</p>

    <p>On the way to school, she texted Wang Ling again, "Classmate Wang Ling. Muyu is actually just a child. There is nothing evil. Grandpa said he is very sensible and we get along well with him."</p>

    <p>"I will bring Muyu tomorrow. Then I will leave it to my classmate Wang Ling the day after tomorrow. Anyway, we only go once a week. It won't waste much time."</p>

    <p>"As for where to take him to play, don't worry, classmate Wang Ling. Leave it all to me."</p>

    <p>After seeing Sun Rong send three strings of text in succession, Wang Ling stared at the phone screen and finally sighed.</p>

    <p>He simply replied.</p>

    <p>Looking up at the sky and thinking about it carefully. Wang Ling thinks this may be the "immortal king's helplessness."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he came to the class, Wang Ling found that the class was extremely quiet today. Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Su Xiao... these people who had been captured by Jingze all looked confused early in the morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling judged that this should not be the sequelae of the elimination of memory, Wang Ming is now fused with the divine brain, the use of brainwaves directed elimination of memory is still very reliable, completely can be done without damage.</p>

    <p>So what's going on with these people... It's like they haven't woken up...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling sat down, he saw Guo Hao and suddenly looked at him, "You know, Lingzi. I seemed to have had a very strange dream yesterday."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling"?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "I dreamt that I killed a dragon yesterday, then I cut open its belly and took out an egg. Inside the egg, it was you!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Sun Rong sitting in front suddenly choked on her water and started coughing repeatedly.</p>

    <p>"Why, it's because of this dream that I'm not awake at all. It is said that dreams are a sign of unstable sleep quality, but if you don't have any dreams, your sleep quality will be higher." Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter what he said. Su Xiao also quickly picked up the conversation, "Hey? You had this dream too. I had it too! But I dreamt that it was Sun Rong inside the dragon egg..."</p>

    <p>"You guys have one Wang Ling and one Sun Rong. Doesn't it sound like the whole dragon and phoenix child?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao raised his head and said, "In my dream I was the dragon baby..."</p>

    <p>Everyone "???"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao touched his chin, "In other words, everyone had a similar type of dream? So what is going on?"</p>

    <p>"It's not surprising. We usually spend time together when studying.</p>

    <p>When we are relatively familiar with each other, there is indeed a certain probability that this phenomenon of living in different beds and dreaming of the same dream will occur." Su Xiao pushed up her glasses and said, "In other words, this is the legendary dream linkage!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling" ..."</p>

    <p>God? Dream linkage...</p>

    <p>"That's true. But I feel that this dream is implying something."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao touched his head. He didn't know why he had been feeling pain in the back of his neck since the day before yesterday. It felt like he had been hit by a truck.</p>

    <p>He gave Wang Ling a meaningful look. Then he said half-jokingly, "You guys tell me. Wang Ling is usually silent. He won't secretly become someone else's father behind our backs, right?"</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this memory erasure method is not very reliable... If he thinks it is necessary, he will have to find a chance to do it again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The matter at Baobai Group's Dragon Cemetery seems to have come to an end. But in fact, it is far from over.</p>

    <p>Since the evacuation of Jingze, all employees of Baobai Group have also evacuated. The entire group collapsed overnight.</p>

    <p>However, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception is well aware that the mastermind behind the scenes, Bai Zhe, is still controlling the situation from the shadows. He has also left behind a dragon time bomb like Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>I have to say that Bai Zhe's handling method has become much more steady and cunning compared to the previous few times where he took the lead and dealt with the enemy head on. He no longer rashly launches a group attack directly with confidence.</p>

    <p>Instead, he is really hiding behind the scenes and making all the arrangements secretly.</p>

    <p>At this time, there are multiple surgeries in progress at the Office of Strategic Deception's Dongtian Peak.</p>

    <p>These were all Baobai employees brought back alive from the Dragon Cemetery. Most Baobai employees were either evacuated or cast a death curse. They were killed by Bai Zhe using dragon spells from a long distance away. Their souls were scattered. There is no record of the death of Heavenly Dao. Even resurrection is impossible.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the long warning sound of the ventilator, one of the last three survivors in the Dragon Cemetery couldn't hold on anymore and took the first step.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed. The purpose of rescuing these three people was not to obtain any intelligence clues from them. They were rescued purely out of humanitarian considerations.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect Bai Zhe to do it so well.</p>

    <p>"This dragon curse is really amazing. The death talismans given by Ling Zhenren were all used by these three people. But their souls are still passing away..." Death Heavenly Dao said with a frown.</p>

    <p>There are only so many methods and techniques for resurrection.</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, it is because the dragon spells on these Baobai employees are too strange. Dragon spells are very different from orthodox cultivation spells. They cannot be judged by common sense.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even the death talisman of Wang Ling may not be effective. It can only delay their death.</p>

    <p>Of course. If Wang Ling takes action, it is not a bad idea to forcibly rescue these people.</p>

    <p>However, birth, old age, illness and death are all human beings' destiny. It goes against the will of heaven and the principles of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling is a whitelisted user, the principle of checks and balances is still there.</p>

    <p>These three people themselves have no life intersection with Wang Ling. If these three people are forcibly saved, then there may be three other people in the world who died due to accidents...</p>

    <p>"I don't know how long the remaining two can last. It just depends on their luck."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao said helplessly. He turned to look at Wang Ming, "Mr. Ming, are you ready?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about me. It's just a little operation." Wang Ming waved his hand and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Today he came to Immortal Toya's Cave Heaven Peak. The main purpose was to cooperate with Immortal Toya's new body made with immortal lotus root and transfer the part of his soul belonging to Shou Chong in his mind to the immortal lotus root.</p>

    <p>This was an agreement between him and Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>And now, it's time for him to fulfill his promise.</p>
