  <h1>Chapter 1373 Wang Ling is going to be famous again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For Wang Ling, writing an essay is not difficult, but scoring points is difficult.</p>

    <p>This is the most difficult scoring item among all the "test questions" that Wang Ling has come across so far.</p>

    <p>Due to the understanding of the text, you can never know what kind of score the teacher who reads the composition will give you.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remember one year's college entrance examination paper. The end of an article was: "Now. It is long dead. But there is still a weird light in its eyes."</p>

    <p>The teacher who asked the question wanted students to understand the connotation of this sentence.</p>

    <p>As a result, in the end, even the original author of this article didn't know what it meant...</p>

    <p>Finally, at the request of Teacher Guan, Wang Ling had to rewrite an essay.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Take a look. Can the manuscript be submitted on Saturday?" Teacher Guan asked.</p>

    <p>All submission portals will be closed at midnight on Sunday.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ling's essay cannot be submitted. Number 60 High School is a wasted spot.</p>

    <p>"Try your best." Wang Ling sighed. He replied helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Then I will delete your article from the background." Teacher Guan nodded happily.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was about to hang up the phone when he heard Guan Ziqian suddenly scream "Oops" on the other end of the phone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Guan Ziqian: "Oops! I think I clicked submit..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan held his head and felt a little crazy: "Damn it! This composition review backend is so poisonous! Why is the Ã— next to it the submit button?"</p>

    <p>When I think about it, a four-character essay will soon appear in the eyes of Chinese language teaching experts across the country.</p>

    <p>"So this is what it feels like to look up at the dark sky..." Teacher Guan suddenly felt desperate.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Guan Ziqian also believes that Wang Ling's essay is very likely to become the lowest score in the essay competition that Number 60 High School has participated in over the years.</p>

    <p>It is also the first zero-point essay...</p>

    <p>The selection of outstanding teachers of the year is definitely gone!</p>

    <p>Guan Ziqian's tears couldn't help but roll down.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The call was terminated. Wang Ling felt that I really felt sorry for Teacher Guan.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he really didn't expect that there would be only one place in this composition contest.</p>

    <p>In every competition in previous years, each school had at least three participating places.</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan pushed hard in the Chinese group, convinced all the teachers, and fought with other scholars. In the end, he forced the Chinese teachers at Number 60 High School to bet all their money on him...</p>

    <p>If he didn't get the ranking this time. Wang Ling felt that he might harm Teacher Guan and he would lose his position as the head of the teaching and research team of the Chinese language group.</p>

    <p>It's really a bit difficult to do!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he should rewrite the article and then ask Wang Ming to hack into the background and replace the article?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling had already had this idea in his mind.</p>

    <p>Now it seems. This seems to be the only way.</p>

    <p>He was about to call Wang Ming when Lord Diulei suddenly sent him a text message: "Brother Ling! The matter in the demon world has been settled. Congratulations to Brother Dog for successfully becoming a divine beast with Tribulation Transcendence! But this time the concentration of chaos is abnormal. I think it is necessary to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling replied with one word.</p>

    <p>Phenomena related to chaos concentration disorder.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that his calculation is probably not wrong.</p>

    <p>It is definitely related to the lack of Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Even if Lord Diulei doesn't come to him, he still wants Lord Diulei to start collecting materials for making a new Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, we can just hold a meeting and explain what we need.</p>

    <p>Currently, the Office of Strategic Deception has a vast network of contacts, especially those on alien planets. This is a condition that no sect on earth has.</p>

    <p>As long as the Office of Strategic Deception comes forward, God's Domain and Heavenly Dao will have to give face to help.</p>

    <p>If anyone is dissatisfied, you can try the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>But the result is 100% yes. You will die if you try...</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way, brother Ling. Actually there is one more thing."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei typed: "I just saw that there is a national essay contest submission. There is an essay about a single person... I see this handwriting. It seems a bit like what you wrote."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Compositions uploaded to the composition platform are all imported by scanning handwriting into pictures.</p>

    <p>For Chinese teachers, the neat handwriting and literary talent of an excellent composition are actually equally important.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, words are like people. Beautiful handwriting is definitely a bonus.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei was able to recognize his notes from just "four characters." This surprised Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because the essays submitted to the backend are all anonymous for the sake of fairness.</p>

    <p>Before the final results come out, all the main evaluators who are responsible for grading will not know who the author of the composition is.</p>

    <p>"If your brother does not deny it, then it seems that you really wrote this composition!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "I was not sure before, so I sent it to Miss Sun Rong to have a look. Miss Sun has been deliberately imitating your handwriting. As a result, people can tell at a glance that it is your handwriting."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled: "Actually, I am one of the main reviewers for this competition."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned: "?"</p>

    <p>"In this competition, a total of six main judges and a 100-member expert panel were selected for joint review. However, those responsible for scoring are all the main judges. The expert panel is only used to review the composition."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "Besides me, the remaining five main judges are. Zhuo Yi brothers, Mr. Sun Yiyuan, President Qi from the Magic Academy of Science, Secretary Sun from the Wan School Alliance, and Wang Jiao."</p>

    <p>"Wang Jiao?" Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>There are still a few Wang Jiao in this world...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, don't doubt your ears. This last judge is your father."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Wang Ling suddenly felt like he was being appointed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling's essay titled {Single Dog} was also quickly included in the background information of the main reviewer.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei has almost settled the relationship...</p>

    <p>Among all reviewers.</p>

    <p>The person who had the most excited reaction was naturally Mr. Boss Sun. His face was red. He stared at the four-word essay and exclaimed: "Great! This essay by classmate Wang Ling... is well written. ah!"</p>

    <p>"Old man, calm down..." Jiang Xiaoche couldn't stand it anymore. There was a lemony feeling in his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Look! My classmate Wang Ling writes so well! It's a very standard thin gold style! How can you achieve this level without more than ten years of work?"</p>

    <p>"But sir... classmate Wang is only 16 years old..."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with 16 years old? You still don't allow people to write when they are 1 year old?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Look. The composition of classmate Wang Ling. Although there is only one word "wang" in the whole article, I think what he expresses should be the meaning of simplicity. And haven't you noticed? The composition of classmate Wang Ling There is actually a sound!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
