  <h1>Chapter 1345 Pretending to be "Mom's" boyfriend?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling found that something is wrong with everyone recently.</p>

    <p>From childhood to adulthood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never been madly pursued by a friend of the opposite sex.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong. This is the first time.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling feel a little panicked.</p>

    <p>Even though he tried to pretend to be calm.</p>

    <p>When I was in junior high school.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he had a "secret crush" on a girl.</p>

    <p>But then Wang Ling recalled it carefully. I didn't think that maybe it wasn't a "secret love."</p>

    <p>That feeling was later seen by Wang Ling. It was like a person who loves animals protecting an injured kitten in the rain on the roadside... It is the sympathy and compassion of the strong for the weak.</p>

    <p>So until now, Wang Ling has not accurately positioned his feelings.</p>

    <p>Emotional stuff. It's so complicated.</p>

    <p>He protected Sun Rong in the name of his classmates.</p>

    <p>But.</p>

    <p>Can that really be called liking?</p>

    <p>Is it possible that it is also a kind of compassion for the weak?</p>

    <p>If that's the case, maybe he'll let an innocent person get hurt again.</p>

    <p>So. Escape became the path chosen by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He knew that he would never be able to take the initiative like Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Such no hesitation...</p>

    <p>Such a vigorous...</p>

    <p>Maybe. The existence of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is what he yearns for, but is trying his best to escape from?</p>

    <p>Who knows.</p>

    <p>A sleepless night. Wang Ling looked out the window. The sun was rising. It was another peaceful day...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows.</p>

    <p>The matter with Sun Rong is not completely over yet.</p>

    <p>Unless the person behind the scenes is uncovered, this matter will never be quiet.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi discovered that something was wrong with the recent trends.</p>

    <p>The first is Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen. These two people seem to have "called"... but so far, no one has the intention to express their feelings first.</p>

    <p>In the early hours of the morning, his mother actually asked her to pretend to be her boyfriend.</p>

    <p>This miraculous operation made Gu Shunzhi immediately feel like five thunders were striking his head. It was simply more terrifying than the Divine Tribulation Divine Thunder Initiation.</p>

    <p>Of course, this happened without Liu Qingyi's complete knowledge. In order not to reveal his true purpose of traveling from the future to Earth, Gu Shunzhi naturally couldn't reveal the truth.</p>

    <p>However, this matter still gives Gu Shunzhi a headache.</p>

    <p>Before departure, Gu Shunzhi logged into the "Bihu" question and answer platform and asked questions about the situation that was about to happen to him.</p>

    <p>[Question: My mom wants me to pretend to be her boyfriend. What should I do?]</p>

    <p>[Answer 1: I just mentioned something. This is really embarrassing. So why don't you post a photo of your mother? I think you can find me! I am a male. I am a turtle cultivator. I have a house, a car and money!]</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>[Answer 2: I just got off the immortal ship. Thank you for the invitation. The mother of the subject must be a female cultivator who cares about appearance. She also pays great attention to taking care of herself. Judging from her behavior, my mother probably has few friends of the opposite sex. Otherwise, she definitely wouldn't. Let your son pretend to be your boyfriend.]</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The second answer hit the nail on the head. Gu Shunzhi made me speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Because it's true that Liu Qingyi doesn't have any friends of the opposite sex...</p>

    <p>Most of the other core members of the Office of Strategic Deception know Liu Qingyi's identity, but they usually don't have much interaction with him.</p>

    <p>Looking for Zhuo Yi. Lord Diulei pretending to be her boyfriend. It's too unrealistic.</p>

    <p>So she can only find people from Number 60 High School. And within Number 60 High School, the number of men Liu Qingyi can find is very limited.</p>

    <p>She didn't have the guts to go to Wang Ling. She dared to form a CP with Ling Zhenren. She wanted to apologize! And it would definitely make Sun Rong misunderstand... and make a woman jealous. This is a terrible thing. Liu Qingyi I still want to hang out on earth.</p>

    <p>And with her current financial strength on earth, it is impossible to defeat Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>As for finding Fang Xing, that's even more impossible.</p>

    <p>Because she knows it very well.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing is on the same boat as Wang Ling. And Fang Xing is very naughty. He might sabotage her plan or something.</p>

    <p>So finally.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi still focused the attention of this wingman tool on herself.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi suddenly felt tired.</p>

    <p>Pretending to be "mom's" boyfriend. Such a novel thing. Even if he is a person of order, he has never experienced it before!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Gu Shunzhi felt confused in his mind.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what to say...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon, the nightmare Gu Shunzhi had been waiting for for a long time finally came.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi dressed herself up beautifully.</p>

    <p>For this plan, the woman has obviously been preparing for a long time. Even the clothes she wears are brand new-a light purple lace dress. The lower body is black stockings and high heels.</p>

    <p>Against the backdrop of Liu Qingyi's perfect figure, Gu Shunzhi really felt the scent of her charming mother in the wedding album...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi usually sees Liu Qingyi mostly wearing Number 60 High School uniforms. Now after putting on these new clothes, he really seems to be a different person.</p>

    <p>People really rely on their clothes!</p>

    <p>"What are you doing standing still! Why don't you go change your clothes?" Liu Qingyi looked at Gu Shunzhi standing there dumbfounded and couldn't help but remind him.</p>

    <p>"Change clothes?" Gu Shunzhi lowered his head and looked at his own clothes. He was wearing casual clothes. There was nothing wrong with him.</p>

    <p>"You don't have a suit? This outfit doesn't match me!" Liu Qingyi frowned.</p>

    <p>This straight male aesthetic is simply hopeless!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there still has to be a woman in this family to teach the boys how to dress!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she had already prepared and took out the high-end suit she had prepared.</p>

    <p>"Where did you get the money..." Gu Shunzhi was shocked.</p>

    <p>"I shared my love experience with Miss Sun last night. Miss Sun was so happy that she gave me a call of 100,000 yuan. Getting a suit is not a matter of minutes. Express delivery is so convenient now. The Spirit Sword is directional transmission. It will be there in a moment." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>"This teaching is actually paid?" Gu Shunzhi was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Let's talk about it first. I didn't confiscate it to Miss Sun. It was forced by Miss Sun. She said she would trouble me if anything happens in the future. She also gave me a black card of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. As long as it is a member of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, Products are all available at a 30% discount." Liu Qingyi smiled.</p>

    <p>Then she took the initiative to take off Gu Shunzhi's clothes and planned to put them on for Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was shocked: "What are you doing..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi: "What else can I do? Let me change your clothes!"</p>

    <p>This action reminded Gu Shunzhi instantly of the memory of Liu Qingyi changing his clothes when he was a child.</p>

    <p>Then, it directly caused Gu Shunzhi's memory to be temporarily confused.</p>

    <p>So, in desperation, Gu Shunzhi spilled the beans.</p>

    <p>"Mom. Don't move... I'll do it myself!"</p>

    <p>"Mom?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"I mean... please don't move. I'll do it myself."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was smart enough to get the conversation started.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi patted Gu Shunzhi's supple ass, stared at Gu Shunzhi's crotch, and couldn't help but laugh: "I've seen a lot of people, and I have seen a lot of things, but I still don't care about this area of a few pounds of meat."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Liu Qingyi stepped on her high heels and turned the door handle without looking back: "Hurry up and put them on. I'll wait for you at the elevator entrance."</p>

    <p>"..." Gu Shunzhi was already in a mess.</p>
