  <h1>Chapter 1469 This chapter is back!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although he said that, when Jiugong Liangzi saw Zhuo Yi rising to the challenge.</p>

    <p>She suddenly felt as if something was violently twitching in her heart.</p>

    <p>The man in front of me is a liar recognized by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Cunning, treacherous, dirty, old liar...</p>

    <p>Since Jiugong Liangzi learned the name Zhuo Yi six years ago, these words have almost become the Jiugong family's stereotype of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She is the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family. In order to restore the family's glory, she opened up the Jiugong family's market and came to Huaxiu Junior High School.</p>

    <p>Only the Jiugong family can experience that kind of hatred that wants to kill Zhuo Yi quickly.</p>

    <p>But now, the girl realizes that things don't seem to be what she thought...</p>

    <p>As one of the future successors of the Jiugong family, Jiugong Liangzi naturally knows how strong Bi Xianzi is.</p>

    <p>It was a ghost whose strength was infinitely close to Itinerant Immortal. It was composed of powerful resentment.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family spent so much money to capture them back then. But now they were wiped out by Zhuo Yi's sword...</p>

    <p>Could it be that the person who killed Thuntihan Ha six years ago was really Zhuo Yi?</p>

    <p>And his true realm is actually more than just Golden Core.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi was in a complicated mood.</p>

    <p>She suddenly felt that this man who had clearly been "labeled" by the Jiugong family suddenly became mysterious.</p>

    <p>But now is not the time to talk about this.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi. It's just a problem outside the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi came to Huaxiu this time just to solve external problems.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the external problems were not solved.</p>

    <p>It actually caused internal problems in the Jiugong family...</p>

    <p>On the contrary, it made Zhuo Yi laugh.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has also captured two other accomplices of the leading man.</p>

    <p>Their faces were pale. Although they were not injured, the Yin Qi entered their bodies, making them tremble all over. They wanted to take the opportunity to escape, but in the end they couldn't even walk.</p>

    <p>"You'd better be honest." Zhuo Yi looked at the three of them with a smile: "You have also seen my strength. It's easy to catch you. Besides, this is Huaxiu Country, not Sun Island."</p>

    <p>"You...are you really Zhuo Yi?" On the ground, the man wearing black earrings gasped laboriously.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi took action in time and saved his life.</p>

    <p>If the elixir hadn't entered his body in time, he might have been drained of his life force by Bi Xianzi...</p>

    <p>"I am Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi did not deny identity.</p>

    <p>Now that things have happened, there is no need to be more pretentious.</p>

    <p>He showed his cards.</p>

    <p>"If there are any extra words, let's talk about it later. Now you need to answer Jiugong's question." Zhuo Yi stared at the three people and voluntarily gave up the interrogation part to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>His eyes were always wary and vigilant.</p>

    <p>Once these people try to fight back and attack the girl, he will not hesitate to use his sword...</p>

    <p>But for now, fighting against these three people is only a small probability event.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi walked over. She saw the other two people who were not injured, and their faces were pale.</p>

    <p>Suddenly there was a trace of doubt in my heart.</p>

    <p>When Bi Xianzi first appeared, they were clearly in the same environment.</p>

    <p>But why... didn't she feel any discomfort?</p>

    <p>Could it be...Zhuo Yi?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is not a fool.</p>

    <p>She thought of the only possibility. Her cheeks suddenly felt hot again.</p>

    <p>So as she walked over, the girl took off her bulky black cloak, intending to cool herself down.</p>

    <p>The white off-shoulder short sleeves and ultra-short jeans reveal Jiugong Liangzi's good figure at a glance.</p>

    <p>Because the cloak was not breathable, the short sleeves on the girl's body were slightly soaked with sweat, and the snow-white chest strap was faintly exposed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's eyes widened when he saw it. He thought to himself that besides the dark style of dressing up, this girl also has such a side...</p>

    <p>Perhaps he sensed Zhuo Yi's attention. Jiugong Liangzi quickly covered himself and glared at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly. He quickly took off his suit jacket and put it on the girl.</p>

    <p>His suits have always been very thin, and they fit just right.</p>

    <p>"Who wants to wear your stuff..."</p>

    <p>The girl's temper has not changed.</p>

    <p>The mouth says no, but the body is very honest.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels like I'm getting used to it.</p>

    <p>She tightened her suit jacket tightly and then stared at the three people in front of her.</p>

    <p>These three people know each other fairly well.</p>

    <p>After the leading man regained his strength, he also stood up. The three of them knelt neatly in front of Jiugong Liangzi in a kneeling posture.</p>

    <p>"First. Name." Jiugong Liangzi's voice returned to that cold tone.</p>

    <p>"My name is Masahide Inoue. They all call me Viagra."</p>

    <p>The man wearing black earrings said: "The two next to me are my younger brothers. In fact, they are not people who work for the Jiugong family. They are just doing things normally. I will ask them to go out together. I also help them get tattoos." Tattooed. The one on the left is codenamed Maca. The one on the right is called Lik."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "So you are collectively called: the aphrodisiac trio?"</p>

    <p>"Don't interrupt..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Zhuo Yi. Then he stared at these people condescendingly: "I'm only going to ask you once. Which side are you from?"</p>

    <p>"Miss. You know. We can't say..."</p>

    <p>Masahiro Inoue looked bitter: "Since I am a member of the Jiugong family, I must be cursed by a ghost. So the eldest lady can try to guess..."</p>

    <p>"eh... I guess you know the truth."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded. She believed what Inoue Zhengwei said.</p>

    <p>If you betray your master like this, there will indeed be risks.</p>

    <p>But as long as you don't say your name or write it down, you'll be fine.</p>

    <p>The safest way is to guess.</p>

    <p>But actually it's not that difficult if you really want to reason.</p>

    <p>How many people in Jiugong's family have the courage to directly attack her, the eldest daughter?</p>

    <p>Since these three people do not belong to the second brother Jiugong Xiushi, then the only ones left are...</p>

    <p>"It's the Sixth Mistress, isn't it." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>Masahiro Inoue did not dare to speak. He just nodded.</p>

    <p>After getting the definite answer, Jiugong Liangzi immediately felt relieved: "Don't worry. It doesn't matter that you are afraid and don't have the guts to say anything more now. It's about the curse. I will be responsible for removing it for you when I get back. But as a condition." You have to tell me everything you know. And from today on, you have to remember that the three of you are dead. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"I understand. Miss!"</p>

    <p>Inoue Masahide had tears in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He would never have thought that the eldest lady would ignore the past grudges and treat them with kindness and resentment...</p>

    <p>"Is the sixth wife you are talking about the one your father married just last year?" At this time, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded: "This is my father's youngest wife so far. And she is pregnant. It is said that she is a baby boy."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Zhuo Yi understood instantly: "It seems that the sixth wife's ambition is not small."</p>

    <p>"I have long suspected that she came in with a purpose. Moreover, I have some evidence."</p>

    <p>"Evidence? Could it be that she is not pregnant at all? Or is it that the child in her belly is not actually your father's?"</p>

    <p>"How do you know..."</p>

    <p>When Jiugong Liangzi and the three people on the ground heard this, their pupils were shocked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shrugged: "Isn't that how it works in house fighting dramas?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi snorted: "Ha... you know! In fact, I am just testing to see if you are that smart!"</p>

    <p>Looking at the man and woman who seemed to be flirting in front of him, Inoue Masahide hesitated to speak: "Miss...I'm here. Actually, there is another problem. I don't know if I should talk about it or not."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Say."</p>

    <p>Masahide Inoue: "The relationship between you and Mr. Zhuo is..."</p>

    <p>The next second. The two of them made different sounds at the same time.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "He is my senior."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "She is my girlfriend."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed instantly. He stared at Zhuo Yi: "Who is your girlfriend! Shameless..."</p>
