  <h1>Chapter 1741 The decisiveness of the sister control</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Since ancient times, all Buddha's palms have been from top to bottom. But Wang Ling's palm is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>This is a palm that combines modern mathematical knowledge and mastery of the principle of parabola.</p>

    <p>By accurately calculating the angle and landing point, the spiritual power is first gathered and struck toward the sky. Through the principle of parabola, the spiritual energy gathered in this palm becomes a concrete palm print in the air. Then it falls rapidly through the acceleration of gravity. The magic power is magnificent and stretches continuously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling aimed at the void and struck one after another. The palms of Buddha struck down continuously. One palm after another. It seemed to be endless.</p>

    <p>Jingze was slapped on the ground and couldn't move. Even if he tried to gather strength to get up from the ground, as soon as he raised his upper body, his whole body was hit hard by Wang Ling's Parabolic Buddha Palm, and he kowtowed to the ground.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his figure continued to sink with the power of this palm. He was gradually buried into the earth in front of him. Finally, he sank to a position six kilometers underground in the Dragon Cemetery before stopping.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jingze's aura of eternal moon starlight has become very dim. Because the injury is too serious, this level of eternal moon starlight is no longer enough to see.</p>

    <p>He was covered in blood. The electric light on his body flashed. It was far less bright than it was at the beginning. It seemed that all the power in his body had been exhausted. It was in urgent need of recharging.</p>

    <p>At this time, all he needed was Wang Ling to add one more palm. Jingze had no chance of surviving. But he still stopped at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>As an "old torturer", he felt that letting Jingze die so straightforwardly was a bit too easy on him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he deliberately left some room for Jingze to have enough time to recover.</p>

    <p>And such a sense of despair, only Jingze could feel it at this time. Although he had a premonition of how strong Wang Ling was, Jingze was stunned and didn't expect that even if he was covered with the eternal moon and stars, it would still be difficult for him. To escape the situation of being beaten to pieces.</p>

    <p>This is a monster...</p>

    <p>A monster among human cultivators. Jingze could never imagine that he, a dragonborn, would be beaten by a human cultivator until he was unable to fight back.</p>

    <p>"Save me..." However, at this time, he had no extra strength. He just wanted to buy some time for his recovery. He began to feel fear. Fear Wang Ling gave him another slap in the face.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>So at this moment, the Dragonborn magic weapon, the diamond gloves and the God-Eating Umbrella on his body all lit up, bursting into bright light.</p>

    <p>Also lit up at the same time was the Burning Sky Chain Hammer he borrowed from Yan?</p>

    <p>This is the only one among their dragon descendants that currently reaches level four. It represents the chaos weapon of light! It has infinite power!</p>

    <p>In front of the Burning Sky Chain Hammer, his diamond gloves and God-Eating Umbrella became followers at this moment. They turned into streams of light and clung to behind the Burning Sky Chain Hammer.</p>

    <p>When the crimson flames burst out from the deep underground pit in Jingze, the immortal divinity of the Burning Sky Chain Hammer also burst out at the same time.</p>

    <p>Bright, brilliant, brilliant, immortal...all these words that symbolize the supreme are reflected in the Burning Sky Chain Hammer at this moment.</p>

    <p>Then, right in front of Wang Ling, the Burning Sky Chain Hammer materialized into a weapon spirit. It was a red-skinned muscular man. He had a big beard made of braided flowers and a pigtail. He looked very much like a giant spirit. God's appearance.</p>

    <p>His body was huge, covering the sky and the sun, and was as high as a hundred feet. At the same time, his eyes radiated light, as bright as two suns.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say any nonsense. This time he didn't hesitate at all. He directly started to strike with another palm. He struck out at the huge Hammer Spirit.</p>

    <p>This palm was simple and unpretentious, without any decoration. But Hammer Spirit already knew that Wang Ling was powerful. He did not relax at all and fully deployed his defensive posture.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A bang!</p>

    <p>He was shocked and his body was immediately covered by a layer of holy flame armor. This was an armor formed from the flames in the core of the sun.</p>

    <p>The moment he appeared, everything around him was burned into scorched earth. Then burned into powder. His whole body was as bright as an eternal star, exuding immortal light.</p>

    <p>"Oops! It's indeed a light weapon... Daddy is in danger!" Wang Muyu felt nervous for a while. He grabbed Sun Rong's shoulder with his little hands and trembled slightly.</p>

    <p>He subconsciously wanted to help. However, Sun Rong hugged him and prevented him from moving: "Don't disturb him. Muyu. Let's just watch his performance."</p>

    <p>"But..." Wang Muyu was still worried.</p>

    <p>Such holy flame armor is simply difficult to defend. When he saw Wang Ling leaning over like this desperately, he immediately thought of the legend of Kuafu Zhuri in his mind.</p>

    <p>Because all his memories were entered into the computer, the knowledge in his mind was mixed. It was like an encyclopedia. He knew a little bit about everything. But because the amount of information was too large, he didn't understand it very thoroughly.</p>

    <p>"Ah! No! Daddy is about to be hit!" Wang Muyu screamed. He stretched out his little hands to cover his eyes. When he saw this scene, he almost cried.</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is powerful. But it is far beyond his imagination.</p>

    <p>Because the moment Wang Ling approached, a large piece of the Holy Flame Armor on Hammer Spirit suddenly lost! The flames in that area gathered into a fire tornado, which was swallowed up by Wang Ling's King's Eyes. !</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Wang Ling gets close, there is no need to consider the influence of the Holy Flame Armor.</p>

    <p>In fact, even without the power of King's Eyes, this holy flame will have no effect on Wang Ling. Wang Ling can't even feel the temperature.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. The sportswear he is wearing is innocent. And the level of enlightenment is not too high.</p>

    <p>If it were close-fitting, the temperature of the Holy Flame Armor would most likely burn his sportswear.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want to appear naked in front of so many people. That's why he used King's Eyes to absorb the holy flame.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>The palm of Wang Ling hit the Holy Flame Armor firmly, beating Hammerling's armor to pieces. In just a moment, his body was as bright as fireworks. Sparks burst out all over his body, directly breaking his defense!</p>

    <p>This palm directly destroyed everything, sending this immortal light into collapse. The hundred-foot-tall Hammer Spirit fell down at the same time, like a mountain collapsing. Countless Baobai Group employees on the ground suffered another disaster.</p>

    <p>At the same time, no one among the living employees at Baobai Group expected that this huge hammer spirit would be killed again in this short moment.</p>

    <p>The strength of this young man is really terrifying. He is basically invincible!</p>

    <p>"It's amazing..." At this time, Wang Muyu also calmed down completely. He no longer thought about helping Wang Ling. His pupils shrank. He felt that his world view and cognition had been subverted. There was a feeling of being refreshed.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in his young mind, one thing was even more confirmed...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu looked at Wang Ling's back with admiring eyes: "He is really my dad. So awesome! Only my dad can be so awesome!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming blushed: "What if... what if... No? Muyu. I don't think you should be so hasty about recognizing your father. Maybe he would rather treat you as his younger brother..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care. He is my father."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu shook his head stubbornly. He buried his little head into Sun Rong's shoulder. He snorted: "From now on, we'll talk about our own affairs. I'll call him daddy. He'll call me brother." ."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ming: "..."</p>
