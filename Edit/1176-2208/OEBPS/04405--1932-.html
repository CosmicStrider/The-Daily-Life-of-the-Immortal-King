  <h1>Chapter 1932 High School Students Trapped in the Spirit World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Zhang Linyan came to this conclusion, the high school students around her looked at her strangely. In fact, they were in admiration for Zhang Linyan's keen insight and analytical ability.</p>

    <p>After all, according to previous experience, it took several groups of cultivators from different countries a long time to figure out the current situation. Of course, there is also a problem of language communication.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Linyan was different. As soon as she landed, she used her archer's keen insight and observation ability to directly analyze half of the situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>Not only that. In terms of communication, both Qu Shuling and Zhang Linyan can achieve barrier-free communication. They have the experience of competing abroad many times, and their language communication skills are already very mature.</p>

    <p>And after arriving here, many of the trapped high school students were fans of Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"My God. Qu Shuling. It's you! Now we are saved. Oh! My God!" A high school student as black as briquettes sighed in English with a heavy accent.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling actually had no impression of this person. But now that he was in front of so many people, he still paid great attention to his image.</p>

    <p>And in order to obtain useful information, he immediately changed his tense face and started communicating with everyone in a very friendly and cordial manner.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan felt sweat on her forehead... This fall out is faster than flipping through a book!</p>

    <p>With this thought in her mind, she glanced at Wang Ling on the other side and saw that after Wang Ling put Li Changzhe down, he sat alone next to Li Changzhe, still looking like he was not interested in anything.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan now understood it completely.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling is pretending to be mute.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is the real mute...</p>

    <p>But Zhang Linyan feels that she likes Wang Ling more.</p>

    <p>A person like Qu Shuling wears countless masks on his face. Only a familiar person like Li Changzhe can communicate without any obstacles. She feels tired even if she talks to Qu Shuling even half a word.</p>

    <p>Both of them are top high school students in Huaxiu. They asked for a lot of useful information in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>Especially Qu Shuling. He got a lot of useful information from the coal ball high school student from the African cultivation country.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pretends to be careless. But in fact, he is secretly sorting out everyone's information.</p>

    <p>He has the ability to "talk to other people's minds." He has a perfect grasp of the current situation without asking at all.</p>

    <p>They were the tenth group to enter the Number 1 training ground in the spirit world. Before their arrival, the total number of students who had previously entered the training ground had exceeded 92. These 92 people came from nine different cultivation countries.</p>

    <p>The current location they are in is a desert oasis. The current test for everyone is to leave this oasis and cross the desert to the distant city.</p>

    <p>It sounds like a very simple task, but so far, none of the first nine groups have completed it.</p>

    <p>From the time the first group of people entered to now, they have been trapped for sixteen days. They have survived until now by relying on the resources in the oasis. And as more and more people are trapped, the resources of this desert oasis will face a depletion situation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>This task setting is quite meaningful.</p>

    <p>Why arrange them directly in the only oasis in the desert?</p>

    <p>This oasis is like a comfort zone. The test of the mission is to make the elite high school cultivators from all over the world work hard to leave this comfort zone and break out on their own.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that the people in front have failed.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Before you guys came here, nine groups of us set off from different directions, trying to find the city outside the desert. As long as one group succeeds, the mission will be completed." At this time, Wang Ling heard someone talking to Zhang Linyan sighed.</p>

    <p>"But you still failed." Zhang Linyan asked: "Have you summarized the reasons?"</p>

    <p>"First, this desert has a certain amount of spiritual consciousness and spiritual interference ability. There is a high probability that perception spells will fail in the desert. Once they fail, they will cause misleading and interfere with judgment."</p>

    <p>The foreign classmate replied in fluent English: "Second, during the entire march, each of us must keep a clear head. Once someone falls, they will be re-transported to this oasis and start from scratch."</p>

    <p>"The third point is that we always feel that the consumption of spiritual energy here seems to be greater than before... Although we don't know the reason, every action we make seems to double the consumption of physical and spiritual energy."</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan felt confused when she heard this. She frowned. Then she carefully looked at the spiritual fruit on the banana leaf beside the campfire. This fruit was collected from the oasis by high school cultivators from various countries.</p>

    <p>These are fruits that Zhang Linyan has never seen before.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling also noticed these fruits. He knelt down and took a bite. Then he spit out the pulp and threw the fruits together into the fire.</p>

    <p>"These fruits are quite delicious. They are all non-toxic. What a waste of you." Brother Briquette said with a distressed look on his face.</p>

    <p>"It's better not to eat these spiritual fruits."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling said: "Haven't you discovered that although these spiritual fruits can temporarily relieve your fatigue, they accelerate the consumption of your spiritual and physical energy? The reason why you can't get out of the desert is probably related to these strange things. The spiritual fruit is also related."</p>

    <p>The trapped cultivators from high school students from various countries heard Qu Shuling's ferocious analysis. Every one of them showed expressions of sudden realization.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Qu Shuling! The number one genius among high school students in Shengke University!"</p>

    <p>Someone expressed their feelings from the bottom of their hearts. Or in the language of different countries. Such fancy sayings put Qu Shuling in a good mood.</p>

    <p>"Leave it to me. I will definitely be able to get out."</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling glanced at everyone. Without saying a word, he directly summoned the spirit sword and prepared to leave.</p>

    <p>"You alone?" Zhang Linyan was shocked and asked hurriedly.</p>

    <p>"I alone am enough."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling walked with a breeze. He looked at Zhang Linyan confidently.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Zhang Linyan discovered the pride and arrogance that overflowed from Qu Shuling. This person not only looked down on Wang Ling, but also looked down on Li Changzhe. In fact, he didn't take her seriously at all.</p>

    <p>Facing Qu Shuling, Zhang Linyan knew that she would not be able to persuade him on her own.</p>

    <p>This is a rhythm that leaves no room for retreat at all...</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>What if Qu Shuling fell down halfway and was teleported back? Wouldn't he die immediately?</p>

    <p>However, it was obvious that Qu Shuling did not think that such a problem would happen to him at all.</p>

    <p>He was extremely confident. He directly stepped on the spiritual sword and walked with the sword. He ran in one direction and turned into a shooting star...</p>

    <p>And then just three hours later...</p>

    <p>Everyone saw that Qu Shuling turned into a meteor again and fell from the sky above the oasis. And he accurately landed in front of Wang Ling. He kowtowed to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
