  <h1>Chapter 1396 Miss Sun becomes serious</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche discovered a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>All this time, all his actions against Wang Ling seemed to be assists...</p>

    <p>Of course, he felt that this was not entirely his fault.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that Boss Sun's fan filter is so strong that he can even make up such a magical thing as a "prosperous wife."</p>

    <p>(╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻What the hell is this!</p>

    <p>After returning home, Jiang Xiaoche opened a bottle of champagne and poured it into a goblet to relieve stress. He planned to drown his sorrows with wine. But the more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He exerted force. The goblet in his hand was crushed by him: "You have the guts. Wang Ling! Pick up girls. I, Jiang Xiaoche, would like to call you number one!"</p>

    <p>As a man of dignity. He will not give up chasing Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>At the same time, as a big pig's trotter, he also needs to relieve himself.</p>

    <p>Last time I didn't make an appointment with Jiang Yingying, who looked very similar to Sun Rong. Jiang Xiaoche has always been obsessed with that girl.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there was nothing else to do now. He turned his attention back to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"Miss, do you want to make a date?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche changed his WeChat account and tried to add friends.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, the sound of a cell phone being thrown came...</p>

    <p>He was blacklisted by Jiang Yingying again!</p>

    <p>It's simply a standard ending!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Over here, Jiang Xiaoche is very depressed.</p>

    <p>In the room of Sun Rong on the other side. Sun Rong is also very depressed.</p>

    <p>The two girls sat on the bed and checked the letters one by one. Sun Ying'er summoned several split bodies to help check. After reading less than twenty letters, Sun Ying'er felt tired.</p>

    <p>Yesterday on the moon. Wang Ying had just trained her. In fact, she has not recovered yet.</p>

    <p>And because Sun Rong had to perform the task of recycling the Rubik's Cube recently in the evening, her training time was also temporarily changed.</p>

    <p>It turns out that I report to the moon on time at eight o'clock every night.</p>

    <p>Now it has been changed to 2 hours of random training every day...</p>

    <p>Then I thought about how I still owe daily self-criticism and haven't written it yet.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she was still busy checking love letters for her Rongrong family. Sun Ying'er felt like the heroine in a tragic novel. It was so miserable!</p>

    <p>More than a hundred love letters. After preliminary screening according to the standards set by Sun Rong, Sun Rong has removed more than 60%.</p>

    <p>Some of them looked like pranks, while others were directly removed from the ranks of "competitors" by Sun Rong just based on their handwriting.</p>

    <p>"I think the expression in this letter is quite sincere. Why did Rongrong remove it based only on the handwriting?" Sun Ying'er frowned and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"The content is really good. The language is rich and full, and the wording is gorgeous and touching. But it's a pity. The font is round. This girl probably doesn't manage her weight well. I don't think classmate Wang Ling will like such a fat girl."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was immersed in reading the letter. He said with a serious expression: "Besides, this girl's writing is too heavy. It proves that she usually has a more fiery personality. But the words she expresses are full of delicacy. To describe it in four words: Duplicity is different."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er made a sound and swallowed.</p>

    <p>A woman who is serious has a strong smell of gunpowder. Although there is not a single curse word in her words, Sun Ying'er still feels an aura of danger.</p>

    <p>Start by checking the letter. This is the expression of the girl.</p>

    <p>She seemed like a completely different person. She had no intention of relaxing at all.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er originally wanted to tease Sun Rong. But it turned out that Sun Rong seemed to have entered an immune state!</p>

    <p>The way Rongrong looks serious is really scary!</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. What are you going to do to these girls? Do you mean to capture them and take them to Shenjiang?" Sun Ying'er asked tremblingly.</p>

    <p>"This is a society ruled by law. How could I do such underworld activities?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong looked like he was deep in thought. After a long silence, he said carefully: "It depends on the situation."</p>

    <p>"for example?"</p>

    <p>"Introduce them to new boyfriends. Or give them enough funds to send them abroad. Anyway, at their age, they are just trying to be fresh." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you a newbie?" Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>This question made Sun Rong raise his head. He looked at Sun Ying'er with a firm look: "I'm not."</p>

    <p>"I...I know Rongrong..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er mentioned it casually. She never expected Sun Rong to answer her so seriously.</p>

    <p>Within half an hour. With the help of Sun Ying'er and the split body, Sun Rong successfully screened all the letters.</p>

    <p>In the end, only nine love letters remained.</p>

    <p>"Do you want me to ask the old man to check?" Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>"No need. This will make grandpa laugh." Sun Rong shook his head.</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha's voice came from in front of Sun Rong's bedroom door: "I wonder if I delayed you from doing the census?"</p>

    <p>It was directly transmitted by Lord Ma. It landed right in front of Sun Rong's door.</p>

    <p>"Come in..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Just thought of Er Ha. Er Ha appeared.</p>

    <p>She looked confused: "How do you know what I am doing?"</p>

    <p>"The fly at the door of Number 60 High School told me. I am also very well-informed now." Er Ha said with a smile.</p>

    <p>The flies in the human world are far less enjoyable to eat than the big meat flies in the demon world. Since they are tasteless, it is better to make use of them in reverse. And this is Er Ha's "Fly Integration Plan from the Human World."</p>

    <p>"You actually control a fly intelligence network..."Sun Rong felt like an eye-opener.</p>

    <p>"Nothing." Er Ha chuckled. It looked at Sun Ying'er: "Don't forget. You still owe me 20 sacks of big meat flies."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>She almost forgot that she even had this homework!</p>

    <p>This was the agreement she and Er Ha made privately when they were in the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube Chamber.</p>

    <p>I made a promise. I had to complete it with tears in my eyes!</p>

    <p>"So. What do you want me to do?" Er Ha already knew what Sun Rong wanted to do. It stared at the nine love letters sifted out from the girl's hand: "Find these girls and swallow them directly?"</p>

    <p>"No! You just need to help me find them. Leave the rest to me." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Awesome. Do you want to kill them yourself?" Er Ha teased.</p>

    <p>"Who said they were going to kill them...it was just a matter of talking with reason and emotion."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong got out of bed. Bowed to Er Ha: "Please. Er Ha!"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I have a good attitude. I will have no problem helping you. Finding these girls will be easy for me."</p>

    <p>Er Ha walked over and smelled the smell on these letters. She already knew them in her heart.</p>

    <p>"Let's go recover the Rubik's Cube first. I'll take you to identify it when I get back."</p>

    <p>At this point, Er Ha frowned: "But it's strange. I can smell the scent of an acquaintance on these letters. Including the pile you sorted out on your bed."</p>

    <p>"The smell of familiarity?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I'm sure there's nothing wrong. After I became a mythical beast, my sense of smell has improved greatly. These letters all have Wang Zhen's scent."</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked: "You mean... Wang Zhen pretended to be hundreds of girls and wrote love letters to Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Because the situation he imagined was too shocking. Sun Rong couldn't recover for a long time.</p>

    <p>If these letters are all written by Wang Zhen, then Sun Rong can't help but ask... why are there such idle and painful people in this world!</p>

    <p>"I didn't say that."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was ashamed. It stared at Sun Rong and said: "Have you ever thought about another situation? Maybe these letters were originally written to Wang Zhen."</p>
