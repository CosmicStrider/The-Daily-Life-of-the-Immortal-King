  <h1>Chapter 2089: This brother can get along. He is really helpful when something happens.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one would have thought that someone could remotely command a cosmic miracle to fight. The key was to join the sect of Wang Ling. Not only did Tiandaoyun not refuse, but he agreed simply.</p>

    <p>Because he was so aggrieved. He had no dignity at all being suppressed by Wang Ling. He was holding a fire in his heart.</p>

    <p>He just didn't believe in this evil. There could be a second evil being like Wang Ling in this universe...</p>

    <p>In any case, instigating a cosmic miracle to participate in the battle is unprecedented.</p>

    <p>The powerful light of Wang Ling can be reflected from here.</p>

    <p>How does the miracle of the universe exist? It is one of the derivatives of the will of the universe. It is something that requires a certain chance to be firmly grasped.</p>

    <p>Ancestral realm monks flock to it, but there are very few people who have truly touched this level. A large part of the reason why the Old Dominator was able to rule a corner of the universe back then was that the outer gods controlled many miracles of the universe.</p>

    <p>So far, there is no clear conclusion on the number of miracles in the universe, because no one has clearly collected them completely.</p>

    <p>Not even the current Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He can summon the miracles of the universe. That is purely due to chance.</p>

    <p>The reason why he dislikes him is because he is strong enough in his own right and does not need to rely on the miracles of the universe to increase his basic combat power like other monks.</p>

    <p>The cosmic miraculous peach tree that is related to Jingke, the evolution of Jingbai. This thing was also realized by Wang Ling after in-depth contact with Jingke.</p>

    <p>It's a bit like it's given with phone credit.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling didn't think there was anything special about the miracles of the universe until the battle with Xiufeng Nian began.</p>

    <p>Instead, he simply saw Xianfeng Nian's obsession with the miracles of the universe. Only then did he discover something extraordinary...</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling closes his eyes. In fact, in his mind, he can hear many ethereal sounds coming from the surrounding universe.</p>

    <p>Bian Shu said that this was the response of other miracles in the universe to him. They all wanted to join his sect.</p>

    <p>That's okay...</p>

    <p>These words were so frightening that a drop of cold sweat broke out on Wang Ling's cheeks.</p>

    <p>The old man, the incarnation of the Biangan Tree, looked amused. "As expected of Master Ling, he's just too weak. Anyway, since I was born, I've seen the universe evolve and change, and I've never seen anyone complain about their own strength."</p>

    <p>Marmot joined the conversation: "Hey, I can actually understand it. It's a bug that doesn't require equipment. It can easily kill the Six Gods' equipment just by relying on basic attributes. If you add it to the list, I'm afraid the equipment bar will explode."</p>

    <p>Bian Shu shook his head: "That's not what you said. With the blessing of this combat power, it is better than nothing. And to sum up the miracles of the universe, in my opinion, there are only benefits."</p>

    <p>"How do you say this?" Wang Ling asked with his chin raised as it was rare for him to say anything.</p>

    <p>"Instead of treating our cosmic miracles as equipment, it's better to treat them as buffs. Turn them on when you use them. Just turn them off when you don't use them. It won't put any extra burden on you."</p>

    <p>Bian Shu smiled and said: "And aren't you afraid that one day you won't be able to restrain yourself and will hurt innocent people? If you can bind more miracles of the universe to you by then, maybe I can't control you with my own power. But in the universe there are enough miracles. Our miracles join forces. At this critical moment, we may be able to help you."</p>

    <p>"What kind of help? Suppressing strength?"</p>

    <p>"It's different from Talisman. It's thorough. It gives Ling Zhenren the ability to control freely. But the duration is probably very short. I'm afraid you'll still have to stick to Talisman in the future."</p>

    <p>The words of Bian Shu make Wang Ling doubtful.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, these are the combat forces that are delivered to your door. If you think about it with normal thinking, there is really no reason to refuse.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is as strange as ever.</p>

    <p>He has always been an indifferent person. He is not a person who pursues the top.</p>

    <p>But what Higanshu just mentioned, if true, is indeed a safety catch for him.</p>

    <p>After all, it may take some time before Wang Ming and Shou Chong's wisdom jointly develop a new Talisman...</p>

    <p>Exactly how long it will take is currently unknown.</p>

    <p>The man told him that if everything goes well, maybe it can be used next year and the year after that. If not, it may take more than ten years...</p>

    <p>Until the new Talisman is developed. Wang Ling is very clear. He must find other suppression methods.</p>

    <p>Very annoying.</p>

    <p>But there is no way.</p>

    <p>His growth rate is getting faster and faster.</p>

    <p>In the past, it would only take two years for a realm to advance, and then the time for this realm advancement became shorter and shorter, and later it became one year, one month, one day... Including now, even though Wang Ling has the talisman attached, his own spiritual power is still continuing to grow.</p>

    <p>It's just like those idle games where you can gain experience by turning on the screen and not moving. It's really outrageous.</p>

    <p>"I understand. What Ling Zhenren means is that he wants me to prove myself, right? No problem! I'll go right now!"</p>

    <p>The villain transformed into the Tiandaoyun hummed and smiled. Then the whole person turned into a line of smoke and dissipated directly.</p>

    <p>"Where'd he go?" the prairie dog was surprised.</p>

    <p>"After all, the miracles of our universe are transformed by the will of the universe. Wherever you want to go, just have a thought. It has the ability to teleport."</p>

    <p>Bianshu replied: "Now, this little Tiandaoyun is probably going to beat up Qiao Yanyuan."</p>

    <p>"Can you beat him? This is the strongest fighting force under Bai Zhe's hands now." The marmot said doubtfully, holding his paws.</p>

    <p>"It's not clear yet. After all, Qiao Yanyuan is also the current ace dragonborn under Bai Zhe. But I think that Tiandaoyun can still be accepted. He can handle it... unless something is wrong. He is really good."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently.</p>

    <p>He hadn't given any specific instructions yet. Tiandaoyun was already rushing to express himself.</p>

    <p>How to say...</p>

    <p>Taking positive action is a good thing.</p>

    <p>But sometimes he doesn't like to be too positive.</p>

    <p>For example, Apple Aid.</p>

    <p>It was because he was too positive that he was sent to another universe.</p>

    <p>However, there are still doubts about the strength of Tiandaoyun.</p>

    <p>The opponent is Qiao Yanyuan. And so far, his ability is unknown.</p>

    <p>This also revealed a spell that allows creatures to evolve through the power of special dragon runes.</p>

    <p>It is very similar to the great enlightenment technique in Heavenly Dao. But it is fundamentally different.</p>

    <p>This is a method of forced evolution through bloodline infection. It will cause the evolved creatures to feel extreme pain.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the Great Attunement Technique is more humane.</p>

    <p>After all, when Dao Ancestor Wang designed the Heavenly Dao spells, they were carefully choreographed. Those with bugs were banned in an unspeakable place. Generally speaking, the Great Attunement spell is gentler.</p>

    <p>For Qiao Yanyuan, there are a lot of masters gathered in the restricted area of the sea. Maybe there will be leaders from various countries who will come in person. Next, it depends on whether Qiao Yanyuan can catch this move.</p>

    <p>According to Wang Ling's premonition.</p>

    <p>This Tiandaoyun might really be able to force Qiao Yanyuan to do something.</p>
