  <h1>Chapter 1243 The Sea of Stars</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After entering the body of Wang Ling, the first step of the virtual spirit is to control the brain. Seize [mental space], and then start to devour the will of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Every human cultivator who is invaded by virtual spirits will face this step.</p>

    <p>And this is also one of the reasons why these human cultivators behave erratically and have drastic changes in temperament.</p>

    <p>The invasion officially begins.</p>

    <p>The mental space of ordinary human beings is not very large.</p>

    <p>This is related to the level of a person's cultivation.</p>

    <p>For example, the previous female teacher named Liu. Her mental space was only the size of a rental house. In Xu Ling's opinion, it was so small that she couldn't even stretch her legs.</p>

    <p>But the advantage is that with a small mental space, it's easier for him to control... As long as it's not too big, it's usually fine.</p>

    <p>The cultivators on the earth are not particularly big. The spiritual space of the True Immortal level is only as big as ten football fields.</p>

    <p>Ethereal confidently sneaked into Wang Ling's spiritual space...</p>

    <p>Then. He was completely shocked by the scene before him.</p>

    <p>Because the spiritual space he saw was a sea of stars.</p>

    <p>The sky is full of stars, and countless planets are orbiting here. They complement each other and exude dazzling brilliance. At a glance, the virtual spirit cannot see the edge.</p>

    <p>This is... the universe?</p>

    <p>This Xu Lin was so shocked that he lost his mind for a moment... How could a normal human cultivator fit the entire universe into his mental space?</p>

    <p>Isn't this even more outrageous than their great Supreme Lord of the Void?</p>

    <p>No. We must evacuate here as soon as possible...</p>

    <p>Void Spirit realized that something was wrong with the situation. He could no longer stay in the body of this human boy. He must return to the Void as soon as possible and report this matter to the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>No one could have expected that such a cosmic-level monster would be hidden in a planet as harmless as the Earth...</p>

    <p>But at this time, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>Because I chose to enter the body of Wang Ling. It was a wrong choice from the beginning.</p>

    <p>This ethereal spirit thought he could still escape. But in fact, he was imprisoned in a human flesh cage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's body is like the iron wall of a cage, locking him tightly inside!</p>

    <p>"You can't escape." At this time, a cold voice sounded from the universe. It didn't just come from any direction... it seemed to be a voice from the universe itself. It affected the pulse of the universe. When it came out, it let the void The spirit felt great pressure.</p>

    <p>A boy with white hair condensed by endless light particles appears here.</p>

    <p>"You are not him... Who are you..." Xu Ling looked nervously at the young man in front of him. Although this boy looked exactly the same as the owner of the body outside, Xu Ling could still tell that this was not the same person.</p>

    <p>"I am his shadow." Wang Ying opened his eyes and replied calmly.</p>

    <p>"Do you think you can eliminate me?" Xu Ling said, "Even if you have the ability to trap me here, you may not be able to kill me... You inferior creatures have no idea of the meaning of life forms."</p>

    <p>Xu Ling smiled.</p>

    <p>He has no body.</p>

    <p>Like light and wind. It is difficult to catch. It cannot be killed completely.</p>

    <p>"Only magic can defeat magic. I'm sorry to tell you. I don't have a physical body either." Wang Ying smiled.</p>

    <p>The next moment, his body quickly disintegrated under Xu Ling's eyes!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Dark shadows overwhelmed the sky. Those stars that exuded brilliant light were shrouded in endless shadows!</p>

    <p>Wang Ying decomposed his body, forming a large-scale Shadow Tsunami, overwhelming the sky, as if he wanted to swallow the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Xu Ling's vision quickly dimmed. In a very short time, he was engulfed by endless black shadows. He felt as if he had fallen into a black hole.</p>

    <p>But he was not afraid. He just felt that Wang Ying's actions were meaningless.</p>

    <p>"So. So what?" Xu Ling laughed.</p>

    <p>"Not much. But this way, I can kill you." The next moment, Wang Ying said. He lifted Shadow Tsunami.</p>

    <p>Looking at the virtual spirit that has been coated with his black shadow. The virtual spirit is indeed incorporeal. But now that it is coated by Wang Ying, everything is different. The high-level life form that they are proud of is coated with shadow at this moment. black.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying could easily see the true appearance of the virtual spirits. They were like silk ribbons that could extend infinitely and float in the air. It felt like the Dove chocolate advertisement back then.</p>

    <p>At this time, Xu Ling realized that his noble body had been "tarnished." He began to become angry. He was as angry as a cat with explosive hair. Even the shape of his body was rising and falling like sound waves: "What do you mean to me?" Body. What did it do!"</p>

    <p>He roared and rushed towards Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying doesn't pay much attention to the combat power of just two slap units. Except for the lack of King's Eyes, his combat power is almost the same as Wang Ling's original body.</p>

    <p>The virtual spirit in front of you can be easily killed with just two slaps. However, Wang Ying cannot really kill. The purpose of his coating is actually to warn the virtual spirit in front of you.</p>

    <p>As long as you are trapped in this man's body, it doesn't matter what stage of life you are in. You can still be killed and destroyed!</p>

    <p>Facing the impact of the virtual spirit, Wang Ying raised his hand calmly. A slap with 15% force accurately landed on the "ribbon" flying towards him...</p>

    <p>The virtual spirit immediately let out a painful scream. At the same time, it sprayed some black substance from its body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying deduced that it should be Xu Ling's blood.</p>

    <p>Xu Ling's blood was originally colorless. But after being coated with his shadow, even the blood was dyed black.</p>

    <p>"You are no longer an advanced form of life. You already have color. You have a body. You can even be hit by me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying looked at Xu Ling. His expression did not look like he was looking at some advanced creature.</p>

    <p>It was a look that looked at waste.</p>

    <p>"That slap that just fell. You should have felt the fear of death."</p>

    <p>"Even if I let you go back to the void now, your Lord will only think that you are an alien and will erase you mercilessly."</p>

    <p>These two short sentences made Xu Ling feel even deeper fear.</p>

    <p>He completely believed what Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>With my current ugly appearance, even if I go back, I will definitely be ostracized...</p>

    <p>"I'll give you a chance. Answer me a question. The answer is over. I will cancel the coating on your body and let you go back." Wang Ying said to Xu Ling.</p>

    <p>This virtual spirit has been cornered: "What do you want to ask..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "You invaded the earth. What are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>Xu Ling fell into silence.</p>

    <p>What kind of problem did he think it was.</p>

    <p>This matter will have to be brought to light sooner or later.</p>

    <p>As long as it doesn't involve the Lord of the Void, he can answer it.</p>

    <p>"We are looking for the key to the Void Gate. Only the great Son of the Void is qualified to be the key." Void Spirit said.</p>

    <p>"You can't open the door on the other side. You actually need a key?" Wang Ying was confused.</p>

    <p>Xu Ling: "As promised. You only ask one question!"</p>

    <p>"Sorry. It's my fault."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying apologized.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he raised his hand: "Then you can go and die."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Wang Ying called out with a palm - 200% power!</p>

    <p>The huge palm force shook the universe.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, this illusory spirit disappeared into ashes.</p>
