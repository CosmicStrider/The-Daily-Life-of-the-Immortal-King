  <h1>Chapter 1775: Sealed Spiritual Object</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling is in a hotel chain suite in Glio City. He uses King's Eyes closely to observe the movements in the distance. And from the beginning, he noticed something strange about the old man disguised as the Soul Formation 9th Level. His strength is far more than that.</p>

    <p>Spirit-binding locks and immortal locks were developed by Wang Ming using part of the extract from the Talisman sealed on his body, which can suppress the spiritual power of cultivators and psychic magic weapons. They are essential items for law enforcement agencies in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>Collectively known as: sealing spirit objects.</p>

    <p>Since the upgrade of the earth, the performance of the spirit-binding lock and the immortal lock has been improved again. It can suppress the vast majority of cultivators on the earth.</p>

    <p>There is only one premise. That is, when the cultivator's own combat power far exceeds the level of the earth, the impact of the "spiritual sealing object" can be ignored.</p>

    <p>When Li Weiwei broke through the pre-arranged mechanism on the island with his body, the spirit sealing formation used for defense was also activated instantly. Dozens of immortal locks moved together. Cultivators on the earth would be shocked when they saw such an formation.</p>

    <p>That is an artifact that True Immortal will be suppressed in a short time if it encounters it. It is even more difficult for Soul Formation realm cultivators to deal with.</p>

    <p>However, the old man in front of him actually decomposed the seawater behind him into withering sea mist, locking the immortal bundle in it and corroding it completely in an instant!</p>

    <p>Accompanied by bursts of misty sea fog, a strange creature with a lion's head and a fish's body suddenly materialized behind the old man, blooming with a dark blue spiritual light.</p>

    <p>"roar!"</p>

    <p>There was a roar. The sea water rolled up. The strata on the island collapsed on the spot. It exploded directly. It was terrifying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can be see that this is the spirit of the old man's Dharma.</p>

    <p>It proves that this old man's strength is at least at the ancestral level... equal to the strength of Peng Xiren he met earlier. Even the strength of the monk.</p>

    <p>He is here to call the shots. He is not exerting all his strength. He is just playing.</p>

    <p>With the fighting power of the ancestor-level warriors, the real fight is directly like Star Wars, which is a scene where the planet is smashed like a bowling ball.</p>

    <p>Before the affairs of the Tengu were all sorted out, an ancestor-level strongman appeared. So what kind of master was the real master behind the Tengu?</p>

    <p>Is there any connection between this matter and Bai Zhe?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held his chin up. He was very curious.</p>

    <p>He felt that the whole thing was more than what it seemed.</p>

    <p>It is related to the Eternal Ones, the old Japanese creatures, and the dragon descendants that Bai Zhe currently leads as the leader of the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>But these are things for later. We can only analyze them slowly after the matter is in-depth.</p>

    <p>Just take the current battle situation as an example. Everything this old man who summoned a lion-headed fish body as a Dharma creature is doing is a planned situation.</p>

    <p>The purpose is to create discord within the Office of Strategic Deception, Huaguo Shuilian Group and Huaxiu Alliance, thereby achieving the effect of direct division and disintegration from within.</p>

    <p>Therefore Wang Ling judged that this old man would not really kill Li Weiwei. In the end, he would definitely leave Li Weiwei's life to spread the message.</p>

    <p>But the lives of the remaining soldiers on the island are not guaranteed...</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, he came out to exchange for a snack. There were so many things.</p>

    <p>A strong man from the ancestral realm bullies a group of cultivators from the earth who are protecting their home and country. This is really a bit too much. It can be called a complete lack of martial ethics.</p>

    <p>"Will dad take action?" Wang Muyu looked at the picture projected by King's Eyes. The expression on his face showed excitement.</p>

    <p>"Hmm..." Wang Ling nodded expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to interfere.</p>

    <p>But if the other party goes too far, he will eventually intervene in the matter.</p>

    <p>It's just now. It seems that someone is one step ahead of him. Taking the stage...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As the leader of the border defense regiment of the sea border garrison, the moment Li Weiwei saw the spirit-sealing object being destroyed, he already knew that the old man in front of him was extremely powerful. He was far from a master that he could compete with.</p>

    <p>Even though he was approaching his physical limit, he was constantly sweating out of fear. However, Li Weiwei still did not take a step back.</p>

    <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

    <p>In the distance. Several self-defense psionic missiles launched by the Marine Immortal Mobile Team came accurately from a distance.</p>

    <p>From the moment Li Weiwei launched the Nantian Archipelago's azimuth formation, the immortal mobile team had received the support signal. They immediately adjusted their cannon heads to lock on the enemy. The missiles were extremely fast, moving forward at dozens of times the speed of sound.</p>

    <p>"You use this kind of scrap metal to deal with me. Don't you think too little of me?" The old man took a step forward. In a completely defenseless posture, he spread the sea mist to surround himself and the whole Tengu troop.</p>

    <p>Just after several missiles approached, the sea fog instantly surrounded it as if it was endowed with spirituality. In an instant, the missile was instantly disintegrated by the fog and turned into a withered bomb.</p>

    <p>"I have withered sea fog to protect my body. Not to mention missiles. Even meteorites can't get close to me." He sneered. Even if he couldn't see the man's face, Li Weiwei could feel the man's face was arrogant.</p>

    <p>This is no longer an enemy that can be dealt with through normal means. The opponent's combat power is beyond the dimensional level. It is so powerful that it is outrageous. It may not even be from Earth.</p>

    <p>For a time, Li Weiwei had a lot of thoughts in his mind, thinking about various possibilities.</p>

    <p>The other soldiers on the island also gasped. They were all holding on. Even though they were not afraid of life and death, physical panic was still unavoidable.</p>

    <p>The sense of oppression brought by this old man was too strong. He seemed to be a character from another universe, another world. He just stood in front of him and did nothing. It made their bodies stiff. It was as if they had been cast by some kind of immobilization spell, unable to move a step.</p>

    <p>At the same time, they also knew very well that this old man definitely did not display his true strength. He was just playing.</p>

    <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, another ear-piercing sound came from the sky.</p>

    <p>The old man was completely used to it: "I said, you scraps of metal are useless."</p>

    <p>He clasped his hands behind his back, looked aloof and arrogant, and paid no attention to the incoming "missiles." He held his chest high, as if he was ready to fight head-on.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of arrogance revealed because he is confident enough in his own strength. He does not believe that anything can really hurt him.</p>

    <p>So what if the Earth has been upgraded?</p>

    <p>The strength level of these cultivators on earth is still difficult to surpass in a short period of time the level of the divine realm.</p>

    <p>To put it ten thousand steps back, even if they are really cultivators from the God's Realm, he can still sweep them away.</p>

    <p>So. He laughed.</p>

    <p>"Come on. Let me see what other methods you have."</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>Bang.</p>

    <p>A figure. To be precise, it was a figure with a red sword aura. It dragged a fierce aura and accurately hit the old man's lower back with a blow.</p>

    <p>The old man's face immediately became distorted. Several of his front teeth collapsed. With a loud sound, he vomited a large mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Li Weiwei and the soldiers behind him all showed horrified looks.</p>

    <p>What did they see?</p>

    <p>A woman wearing a nine-tailed fox mask...</p>

    <p>Use your blow to smash the old man's defense directly?</p>
