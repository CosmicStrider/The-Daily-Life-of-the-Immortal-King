  <h1>Chapter 1690 Battle Mode</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The breath released by these lotus flowers is extremely amazing. It is beyond ordinary people's imagination.</p>

    <p>Compare the dragon-headed suture monster in front of you. Although the composition of it is similar to that of Fairy Daolian, the difference in aura is still obvious.</p>

    <p>Especially when Daolian immortal entered "combat mode" under Wang Nuan's order.</p>

    <p>As the immortal woman, who was only a few inches tall, swung her lotus skirt, the powerful energy of the great avenue spread out in an instant, shaking the whole world and affecting the laws of this supreme world.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of breaths under the lotus skirt. It has a kind of power that can move everything. The overflowing power of chaos shuttles in the void, making time and space flow. It seems to have a chaotic power.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The dragon head summoned by Master Wu Xin started to sew the creatures at this moment. A dragon claw in the body was like a tentacle. It suddenly extended infinitely from the body and grabbed Daolian's immortal son.</p>

    <p>With one claw, the ground was turned upside down. It was so violent that it enveloped Daolian's immortal child.</p>

    <p>Daolian's immortal son didn't say a word. She closed her eyes slightly, carrying an aura of unparalleled elegance. She only used her body of less than a few inches to stretch out her slender little finger.</p>

    <p>It was just a moment. Everyone seemed to see a divine moon emerging behind Daolian Immortal.</p>

    <p>It's cold, bright and arrogant. There is an aura of myth spreading throughout.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>She pointed her finger at the dragon claw with intelligence. From the eyes of everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception, Dorian Immortal's fingers were so tiny that they were almost as big as sesame seeds in front of the huge dragon claw.</p>

    <p>However, when this finger the size of a sesame seed collided with the dragon's claw, it exploded into pieces on the spot! It was directly shattered!</p>

    <p>With the power of just one finger, the dragon's head was sewn together and the dragon's claws, which looked like mountains, were shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>The Fairy Daolian summoned by Wang Ling. Although it is small, its power is indeed unparalleled.</p>

    <p>After the dragon claw was shattered, the backlash pain was quickly fed back to Master Wu Xin. Pain began to feel in his brain. He would have spit out a mouthful of old blood, but when it reached his mouth, he swallowed it again. In the stomach.</p>

    <p>As an Eternal, he didn't want to appear embarrassed in such an occasion.</p>

    <p>However, the strength of Wang Ling was far beyond his imagination.</p>

    <p>It even started to make him feel desperate.</p>

    <p>He couldn't figure out why such a person could survive in the world. He was less than twenty years old, but possessed many great qualities.</p>

    <p>Even though he didn't show any intention, his eyes clearly showed fear.</p>

    <p>Although this look was fleeting, it was quickly captured by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The battle between masters is all about momentum.</p>

    <p>Once you show such a look.</p>

    <p>Then it means.</p>

    <p>It's a foregone conclusion.</p>

    <p>In order to better protect Wang Nuan, Wang Ling did not take action himself. Instead, he summoned the Lotus of the Dao and let Daolian immortal solve the problem on his behalf.</p>

    <p>He clearly knows the fighting power of Dorian's immortal son. Therefore, he has no worries about the outcome of this battle.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Perhaps he caught the trace of fear in Wu Xin's eyes. Daolian Immortal took action decisively again.</p>

    <p>She still didn't say a word. She directly separated from the remaining Daolian and turned into the most dazzling meteor floating in the sky. From bottom to top, she used her slender legs to slap the dragon-headed stitch monster hard and said. The huge explosion shocked everyone.</p>

    <p>No one doubts the power of this whip kick. It is extremely fierce. It has the power to cut off everything. It sweeps across the entire field!</p>

    <p>The dragon-headed suture monster suffered a severe blow. Countless faces in its entire body began to become distorted. Endless wails came from all directions.</p>

    <p>Dorian's immortal kick directly caused a huge dent in the dragon-headed suture monster's huge body. On the huge body, dozens of faces in that area seemed to have been crushed by something. They were twisted into a ball.</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin finally couldn't bear the pain of the backlash under such huge force. The blood he had just swallowed surged out of his body again. It spurted out on the spot. At the same time, he felt severe pain in his brain.</p>

    <p>There was almost a posture that was torn apart on the spot. On the other side, Dorian's immortal son, who had activated the battle mode, could not be said to be ruthless. Between the rhythm of her small figure, several phantoms began to differentiate. They attacked this animal from all directions. The dragon-headed stitch monster launches an offensive.</p>

    <p>With each kick, Master Wu Xin had to vomit a mouthful of blood. With four kicks, Master Wu Xin had fallen from the void to the ground. Like a meteor that had lost its light, he knelt down on the ground.</p>

    <p>His originally delicate and handsome face was no longer delicate. Instead, it began to look old.</p>

    <p>Every kick of Dorian's immortal son is so powerful that it can break the stars. It can also break a person's years.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Wu Xin discovered that among the twenty-eight avenues owned by Wang Ling, there was actually one... the legendary Avenue of Time!</p>

    <p>Although it is not a major path, this path is the one that controls eternal life!</p>

    <p>It was the one he had always dreamed of mastering...</p>

    <p>This young man clearly understood this avenue, but he did not regard it as a major avenue, but put it aside?</p>

    <p>This makes Master Wu Xin unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Therefore, every kick of Daolian Immortal's wife carried the power of time. One kick after another, Master Wu Xin was kicked from this delicate and handsome appearance to an old helper.</p>

    <p>He couldn't even stand still. He knelt on one knee and shivered. The wrinkles on his face were particularly obvious. In an instant, he lost all dignity.</p>

    <p>As an Eternal, I have no intention of being extremely ashamed and angry. This is so unfortunate. It is also a great shame and humiliation!</p>

    <p>"I haven't lost yet... I..."</p>

    <p>Dorian's immortal son has no nonsense. Even if Wu Xin has become such a miserable situation, there is still no mercy. After activating the battle mode, she will only follow the instructions issued by Wang Ling to complete her mission.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>I saw her snap her fingers again. With a "Hongmeng Finger" move, she hit the dragon's head to sew up the monster's expression.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the entire earth of the Supreme World was cracked. It was divided into fine grids like a cake being cut. It was densely packed. One piece after another was divided extremely evenly.</p>

    <p>The huge energy penetrated directly, disintegrating the Stitch Monster instantly. It was torn into pieces. Countless pieces of flesh were exploded. Then, as the power of chaos penetrated, it turned into powder little by little.</p>

    <p>"Poof!" Master Wu Xin spurted blood again. Unable to resist, he fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>There is basically no suspense in this kind of battle. It was already doomed from the moment Dorian's immortal son took action.</p>

    <p>From the moment Wang Ling decided to kill Wu Xin no matter the cost, he took the initiative.</p>

    <p>There was no room for resistance. The entire beating made everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception stunned.</p>

    <p>After confirming that Master Wu Xin was completely knocked down and unable to get up again, Daolian immortal returned to the Lotus of the Avenue with a pure and clean body.</p>

    <p>Then, the petals of the lotus flower closed up again, and then transformed into a piece of light and electricity, which was sucked back into the pupil of the king's pupil of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Is this the end?" Everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception was confused.</p>

    <p>Of course not.</p>

    <p>Previously, this was just a performance by Doryeon Immortal.</p>

    <p>It's not Wang Ling's turn yet</p>

    <p>Although the Master Wu Xin in front of him was already a dying dog. But this time Wang Ling had no intention of sending out his Sacred Heart.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Two loud noises came again!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling takes Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Brother and sister. One of them gave Master Wu Xin a slap in the face.</p>

    <p>The Eternal One who had previously clamored to make them into specimens.</p>

    <p>Finally, at this time, the supreme world fell apart and turned into a minced meat pie. It stopped breathing forever.</p>
