  <h1>Chapter 2047 Summoning Miracles</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, I didn't expect that the card in Xianfengnian's hand actually contained a "Miracles of the Universe."</p>

    <p>You must know that the miracle of the universe is a powerful force that transcends all ways. It is directly connected to the will of the universe. It is more powerful than the natural artifacts spawned from chaos.</p>

    <p>Miracles of the universe have no specific image. They can be anything in the universe... they can be transformed into dharma, they can be transformed into specific rare beasts, they can also be magic weapons and spells. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>In short, everything that can be labeled as a "miracle" can be regarded as a huge trump card in the hand.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, this should not be something that can be touched in the Ancestor King realm. Only the Ancestor Immortal realm can have a certain probability of sensing the existence of the miracles of the universe and comprehending them.</p>

    <p>Just like after reaching the ninth level of True Immortal, you have the ability to comprehend Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Before the ninth level of True Immortal. Wanting to touch Heavenly Dao. That would be a fantasy.</p>

    <p>But now this tree on the other side, which can be called one of the miracles of the universe, has been directly summoned by Xuefengnian in the form of a Dharma form. From Wang Ling, it seems that Xuefengnian can have this card. It is still due to the fact that it was planted on his body. For the sake of Heavenly Dao tradition.</p>

    <p>However, compared to miracles. Wang Ling will certainly not be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>When you are fighting against Wang Ling, you will never guess how many undisclosed cards this handsome dead fish eye has.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling uses his own Dharma as nourishment and at the same time puts Jingke into Bai Qiao and pierces the ground, another huge tree trunk rises from the ground.</p>

    <p>The radius is hundreds of feet high. It is no weaker than the tree on the other side in front of you. The pink peach petals scattered all over the sky dance with the wind. The spiritual light emerges from it. It is full of divinity.</p>

    <p>The golden tree trunk burst out with bright and dazzling divine power, directly rendering the pink peach petals floating in the sky into pale gold.</p>

    <p>The moment these peach petals with blazing golden light fell, clusters of golden flames began to burn, incinerating everything.</p>

    <p>An ideal paradise...</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ying was stunned.</p>

    <p>His mind was like a clear mirror. He knew that this was a real illusion and named the trick.</p>

    <p>An ideal peach blossom source. All the peach blossom petals fallen from the miraculous peach tree can be ignited using the "real illusion" method to burn all evil forces.</p>

    <p>Among the miracles, the tree on the other side is not considered an evil force. But now the tree on the other side has been polluted. The blood of the alien gods attached to it is a symbol of evil.</p>

    <p>So when the golden flames of the peach blossom petals fall on the animal scales on the trunk of the other side tree, you can hear the painful roar of the mutated other side tree.</p>

    <p>However, this "ideal peach blossom land" is just the passive ability of this miraculous peach tree when it comes.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The next moment, a large number of peach blossom petals fell down. Those peach blossom petals floating in the void reflected luster. A shocked white face was clearly printed on each petal.</p>

    <p>In an instant, one after another, the peach blossom petals turned into endless sword light and rushed toward the tree on the other side in front.</p>

    <p>It was just an instant. The scene of hundreds of thousands of sword energy firing in unison was jaw-dropping.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the miraculous peach tree gave birth to two of the strongest sword spirits in the sword king world at the same time. It is really too terrifying!</p>

    <p>Turn every peach blossom petal into a shocking white sword energy. In one second, there are 108,000 sword energy slashing the void. Such a powerful vibration shakes the supreme world, which has already fallen into a mess. The supreme world is even more devastated.</p>

    <p>Such fluctuations were too shocking. It was beyond everyone's imagination. Sun Ru and Immortal Toya's mouths could no longer close at all. The two of them were frightened. They only felt horrified.</p>

    <p>"With the power of the outer gods... it is impossible to lose!" Xufengnian on the other side still showed an expression of disbelief. He couldn't believe that he had even used this miraculous trump card and would still be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>And what makes him even more horrified is that he only has miraculous powers. The young man opposite actually also has miraculous power in his hands...</p>

    <p>What is this peach tree?</p>

    <p>He has never heard of it!</p>

    <p>The most powerful tree miracle in the universe is undoubtedly the Tree of the Other Side! And this is the Tree of the Other Side that incorporates the power of the outer gods!</p>

    <p>A tree-shaped miracle of the same type cannot be the rival of the tree on the other side!</p>

    <p>But in front of me, the power of this miraculous peach tree was too terrifying. One hundred and eight thousand powerful sword energy swept across in one second, causing everything in front to collapse. Wherever the sword energy passed, space was everywhere. Traces of fragmentation.</p>

    <p>However, this is only the most basic routine operation.</p>

    <p>In the space crack split by the sword energy, traces of chaotic energy leaked out. At this moment, it was like the Milky Way pouring in. Endless cosmic mist poured in from the crack, casting a layer of mystery on this showdown between the miracle trees. veil.</p>

    <p>The crying sound of the tree on the other side became louder and louder, but to the angry and humiliated Xifeng Nian, it was completely inaudible.</p>

    <p>"Release the water! You must be your damn thing who is releasing the water! You are the number one sacred tree among the tree-shaped miracles! You also have the Heavenly Dao tradition! How could you lose! The Ten Thousand Scales Armor on your body. Is it fake? Really!" Xufengnian collapsed and cursed. He broke it directly from the trunk. He picked up the huge wicker that had been chopped off by the Miracle Peach Tree's sword energy. He pulled the wicker and hit the tree on the other side. He was so hysterical that there was no trace of it. The aloof aura of genius.</p>

    <p>But the cry of the tree on the other side. Wang Ling could be heard clearly.</p>

    <p>He looked at Xufeng Nian who was almost going crazy in front of him. He raised his hand and waved. The countless peach tree sword energy that followed was no longer aimed at the tree on the other side. Instead, it was directed at Xufeng Nian.</p>

    <p>"Quick! Protect me!"</p>

    <p>A trace of cold sweat ran down the cheeks of the old man. He pulled the vines hanging down from the branches of the tree on the other side. He wanted to repeat his old trick and hide in the huge trunk of the tree on the other side.</p>

    <p>But this time, there was no reaction from Bian Shu.</p>

    <p>"You damn thing..."</p>

    <p>The year of decay is tense.</p>

    <p>I never expected that at such a critical moment, the miraculous dharma image I summoned would actually betray me and be completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>Not only that. The other shore tree also retracted all its branches, completely giving up its defense.</p>

    <p>As a conquered miracle of the universe, it also has a contract in its hand that cannot betray its master. But Wang Ling can see that this tree on the other side is really living in pain.</p>

    <p>It would rather take the risk of violating the contract than to betray Xifengnian. It makes those who see it feel particularly complicated.</p>

    <p>Xufengnian's eyes turned red. The moment he was hit by the endless sword energy of the miraculous peach tree, he issued his most vicious curse: "I'm injured! You can't get better! You have to die too!"</p>

    <p>This is how he issued his vicious curse.</p>

    <p>But little did they know. Wang Ling would not let him succeed like this.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling currently doesn't know how Xifengnian could communicate with the miraculous will of the tree on the other side in advance even if he had the external Heavenly Dao system.</p>

    <p>But the miracles of the universe. As a manifestation of the will of the universe. Every miracle should be a protected treasure.</p>

    <p>It should not be ravaged and abused like this.</p>

    <p>So... just a second before Xiufengnian was about to be hit by the 18,000 shocking white sword energy from the miraculous peach tree.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the King's Eyes. At the same time, he unveiled half of the sealing talisman on his body.</p>

    <p>He decided.</p>

    <p>The contract of the miraculous tree in front of me was wiped out directly across its owner's decayed years...</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>Such extreme operations. Wang Ling also comes at a certain price.</p>

    <p>After all, the contract to be erased this time is a miracle of the universe. It is a manifestation of the will of the universe.</p>

    <p>The price Wang Ling has to pay is: the vision will be blurred for 24 hours... and within 24 hours, you will get a limited-time experience card for 600° myopia.</p>
