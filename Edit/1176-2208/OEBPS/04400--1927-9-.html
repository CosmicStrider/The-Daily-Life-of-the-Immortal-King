  <h1>Chapter 1927 Breaking through the door of 9-day teahouse</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jing Heqiu didn't expect that it would be so easy to invite someone out of the house as long as he liked him. He looked at the boy who still looked childish in front of him. The Adam's apple on his neck couldn't help but twitch. He felt in his heart. He couldn't help but sigh immediately.</p>

    <p>After all, he is still a child. He cannot bear this benefit. He will never become a great person in the future.</p>

    <p>To have him, the dean of Jingmi Academy, come out to invite people in person. Jing Heqiu is absolutely unwilling. At the same time, precisely because he is the dean of Jingmi Academy, Jing Heqiu has his own way of identifying talents.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, Wang Ling cannot be called a talent at all. It is far worse than all the young geniuses he has seen.</p>

    <p>But this was the person Teng Lao wanted to see. Jing Heqiu had no choice. Although he had a kind of contempt in his heart, he did not show it.</p>

    <p>Still looking at Wang Ling in a good voice. He bowed and said, "Hello, classmate Wang. I wonder if classmate Wang has received an invitation from Jiutian Teahouse. Our director wants to meet you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already spread the seasoning packets. At the same time, he was looking Jing Heqiu up and down.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he had no intention of going out at all. But just now Jing Heqiu laid out so many limited-edition crispy noodles in a row on the ground. Looking at the golden outer packaging, Wang Ling really couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>His hand reached out involuntarily. As a result, it was over.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, taking advantage of others is short-handed. Since he has accepted the benefits of others, then it is also what he should do to cooperate with the work.</p>

    <p>Judging from Jing Heqiu's outfit, it is not difficult to judge that this is one of the top executives of the Geocentric Project. If he refuses now, he doesn't know what kind of harassment he will encounter in the future.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Finally, he nodded helplessly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The time came on the evening of January 14th in front of the Zhuque Gate in Songhai City. The evening market had ended ten minutes early.</p>

    <p>As the main entrance of Suzakumon Gate was closed, a large number of high school students wearing their respective school uniforms gathered at the door.</p>

    <p>The Zhuquemen Ancient Street, which had become completely quiet, was completely dark. It was pitch black. Only the Jiutian Teahouse in the ancient alley still had two simple lanterns lit in front of it, as if waiting for their arrival.</p>

    <p>After confirming that the last staff member had left the Suzaku Gate, everyone knew that the operation had begun.</p>

    <p>They need to break through the Suzaku Gate and reach the Jiutian Tea House before midnight.</p>

    <p>Although the staff on duty have evacuated, they still have to be careful of the floating electronic balls patrolling around the Suzaku Gate. It is a scientific device that guards the entire Suzaku Gate for any abnormal movements.</p>

    <p>Although it is not stated in the rules, it is the right choice not to disturb those alarm electronic balls.</p>

    <p>Everyone was preparing to take action. However, at this moment, a young man wearing a black redeeming gown suddenly jumped out. Directly ahead of everyone else, he headed towards the main entrance of the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>"It's Qu Shuling! He's here!"</p>

    <p>Someone recognized the figure of Qu Shuling, the president of the Shengke Student Union. However, no one dared to imagine that Qu Shuling was so courageous. The alarm electronic ball was patrolling near the main entrance of Suzaku Gate. Under such circumstances, he actually dared to walk in directly and openly.</p>

    <p>All the students in the dark held their breath at the same time. They wanted to see how Qu Shuling would break through the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>However, what everyone expected was that when those alarm electronic balls passed by Qu Shuling, they did not make any alarm sound.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Did you hack into the system in advance?" Some people were puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Probably not. If you hack into the system, why not just turn off the alarm ball?" Li Changzhe thought for a moment and said, "Don't forget. Qu Shuling is proficient in all systems! He can change the body's magnetic field through elements. This is also his usual method..."</p>

    <p>"Yes. I think so." Gong Xuan from Jian Shen Academy nodded beside him: "By changing the magnetic field, the frequency of its own magnetic field is consistent with that of the alarm ball. This causes the alarm ball to misjudge. It is thought that Qu Shuling is also a member of the alarm ball."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the other students cursed in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Abnormal!</p>

    <p>I'm afraid only Qu Shuling can do this kind of method!</p>

    <p>As they watched Qu Shuling majestically walk towards the closed Suzaku Gate, using wood spells to integrate with the Suzaku Gate and easily escape into the Suzaku Gate, everyone also thought of a way to break through the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>They are all elite students from the top thirty cultivation high schools in Huaxiu. It is not difficult to break through a city gate.</p>

    <p>The key is not to disturb these alarm balls. This is a test with a slightly increased difficulty level. But overall it is harmless.</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan held the spirit sword in his hand. He drew a line of sword energy directly in the air. He accurately calculated the landing point of the parabola. Then he used the sword energy to build a narrow bridge of sword energy. Then he quickly put away the spirit sword. Controlling the sword energy and walked out. It was like a skateboard, allowing him to easily cross the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>Most of the alarm balls have a magic weapon early warning mechanism. If you drive the spiritual sword directly, the alarm will definitely react to the running magic weapon, even if it is a spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>But it's different when you first use the spirit sword to draw sword energy to build a bridge for yourself. This is also a speculative cover-up.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe secretly admired the methods of people's eight-immortal crossing of the sea. Some used escape techniques to escape from the ground. Others directly used body shrinking spells to stick to others. Others directly inflated their bodies to turn into a floating body. The empty human balloon flies over the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>"Interesting." Li Changzhe deliberately didn't take action first. He stood admiring it for a long time. It wasn't until he finished the cup of crab roe milk tea in his hand that he patted the ashes under his butt and stood up from the ground.</p>

    <p>It was certainly not difficult for Li Changzhe to break through the Suzaku Gate. He squeezed the seal with his hands and directly decomposed his body at a very long distance, turning it into a pool of mist. Then it flowed in along the cracks in the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>These white mist finally reorganized behind the Suzaku Gate and transformed into Li Changzhe's appearance again.</p>

    <p>At this time, almost everyone had gathered inside the Zhuque Gate.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe roughly counted the number of people. Then he smiled and said: "Let's go. Let's go to Jiutian Teahouse. Qu Shuling should have already gone in."</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at each other and nodded to each other.</p>

    <p>Then he followed Li Changzhe's footsteps and explored the dark ancient streets, and finally confirmed the location of the Jiutian Teahouse with two lanterns lit at the door.</p>

    <p>But what they didn't expect was that Qu Shuling was standing in front of the Jiutian Tea House. And his calm attitude was completely different from the previous one when he entered the Zhuque Gate.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Li Changzhe felt that Qu Shuling was a little angry.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment, a raging fire ignited from Qu Shuling's palm.</p>

    <p>"Meteor Flame Palm?" Qu Shuling recognized this palm technique. And it is a third-level high-grade palm technique! It can easily break boulders!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He saw that Qu Shuling's palm hit the door of Jiutian Teahouse accurately.</p>

    <p>However, this strange teahouse door seemed to have the ability to absorb the power of elements. It immediately resolved Qu Shuling's palm!</p>

    <p>With one palm strike, the door of the teahouse did not move at all, but Qu Shuling was staggered by the shock. The huge impact pushed Qu Shuling away. He did several backflips in the air before landing firmly on the ground.</p>

    <p>When Li Changzhe, Gong Xuan and other students saw this scene, they couldn't help but have a look of horror on their faces.</p>

    <p>They understood immediately.</p>

    <p>The real test this senior gave them was not to break through the Suzaku Gate!</p>

    <p>But to break through the teahouse door and enter the teahouse!</p>
