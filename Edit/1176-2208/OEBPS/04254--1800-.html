  <h1>Chapter 1800 Tonight. All of us are Gray Cult leaders!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Maiko Abei.</p>

    <p>A little girl wearing a light blue dress. She is obviously not very old, but she dyed her beautiful pink curly hair.</p>

    <p>When everyone at Number 60 High School heard the little girl's name inside the door, they all invariably connected it with the name of the legendary Mixiu Country general, Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was shocked: "Is this the daughter of the legendary general? She is also a Gray Cult believer?"</p>

    <p>Everyone gasped. There are very few Gray Cult believers who can go all the way to this location without any hindrance. And Maiko Abei has the identity of the daughter of General Maiko Assi to protect her. Even if the white warriors at the door saw Maiko Abei Nor would they have thought that the daughter of this legendary general came to the hotel for entertainment not to see the leader of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, everyone at Number 60 High School is still preparing to act according to the previously agreed upon plan.</p>

    <p>It is true that Sun Rong is the leader of Gray Cult. However, after all, the influence of all forces in Glio City is very complicated. Without in-depth contact, everyone feels that it is better not to reveal Sun Rong's identity as the leader of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>So during the meeting with the believers, several people discussed it and let Sun Rong stay in the room inside and command the operations remotely. The rest of the people were responsible for taking turns playing the role of the leader of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Even the order has been decided.</p>

    <p>The first person to play the role of the leader of Gray Cult was Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>When the door to the suite opened, Maiko Abei walked in full of longing. There was a little starlight in her eyes, as if she had embarked on a path to cutting-edge literature and was about to realize her ideals.</p>

    <p>"Hello. Miss Xiaobei. I am...the leader of Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>All this followed Guo Hao's greeting, like a basin of cold water pouring down directly.</p>

    <p>There was obvious surprise on Maiko Abei's little face. She looked at the fat man in front of her. For a moment, she felt as if her dream had been shattered: "You...you are...the leader of Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"What? Are you disappointed..." Seeing the eclipsed face of Maiko Abei, Guo Hao himself was also deeply shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't do anything wrong. He was just entrusted to protect the true identity of Sun Rong and went into battle. Unexpectedly, he was despised by the Gray Cult believers from Glio City in the first round.</p>

    <p>"No. Not disappointed."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei tried her best to keep a smile. She shook her head: "It's despair."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei: "The Gray Cult leader I imagine is a person enveloped in light. Not a person enveloped in fat..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>It can be seen that after Maiko Abei said this, Guo Hao almost felt a little unable to sit still. However, for the sake of the overall situation, the rest of the people stood in a row behind Guo Hao, firmly holding Guo Hao's shoulders. Press and hold.</p>

    <p>The scene was indeed a bit embarrassing. Even Wang Ling began to feel a little embarrassed for Guo Hao. Although Guo's body was slightly swollen, he was actually a flexible fat man. As one of the elite class students. Number 60 High School also ranks among the best in the physical education examination.</p>

    <p>Have you ever been so humiliated...</p>

    <p>It is not terrible to be despised by the people around you. After all, the more insulting you are, the closer the relationship is.</p>

    <p>But being approached by a complete stranger was such a head-on blow. Guo Hao instantly felt a heartbreaking pain. He could hardly bear it!</p>

    <p>Perhaps she realized that what she said was a bit too much. Maiko Abei's little face was immediately filled with a smile: "Ah. I'm sorry. Lord Leader. Actually, I didn't mean that. Many of my words were unintentional. I don't know why. After seeing your face, because the gap with my heart was so big, I blurted out involuntarily..."</p>

    <p>"No problem, no problem..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao tried to stay calm: "Speaking of which, Xiaobei. Since you saw me posting the coordinates and coming here, you should know what happened, right? And you should know. Your identity is very special..."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei said: "My father is Mixiu Country's legendary general Maiko Assi. It is for this reason. When I first went upstairs, none of the white warriors dared to stop me or follow me. They all thought I was here to do beautician work."</p>

    <p>"A little girl still does beauty treatments?" Guo Hao laughed.</p>

    <p>"Of course girls need to take care of themselves. Otherwise, when the fat accumulates, you won't be able to lose weight even if you want to." Maiko Abei replied with a smile. And this sentence once again made Guo Hao felt like he had been hit in the knee by an arrow.</p>

    <p>"Let's not talk about this, Xiaobei...you know. I need your help now."</p>

    <p>"No problem! Although the appearance of the leader of Gray Cult disappoints me. But I am a loyal Gray Cult believer. Your image is still a paper figure in my heart. I just need to forget your appearance when I look back. Gray Cult Leader. It can only be what I think in my heart!"</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei said with a hint of yearning in her eyes: "Look. A grain of dust in the times...what a beautiful sentence!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong, the rest: "..."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure it's okay, Xiaobei? We want you to be our spy. And we need you to provide information about your father Maiko Assi's movements..." Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course, no problem! My father has never had time to accompany me. He often shouts about becoming bigger and stronger outside. I wish he would be embarrassed outside. It would be better if he is embarrassed enough to stay at home."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei smiled and said: "It would be great if my father could fall. In this case, I can prepare a cage at home and keep my father in it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and others: "..."</p>

    <p>After hearing what Maiko Abei said, everyone at Number 60 High School was a little shocked.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Even the pink hair is black...</p>

    <p>This is too terrible!</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that the legendary daughter of a legendary general would actually be a yandere...</p>

    <p>"Okay Xiaobei... you passed the interview. I will ask for your advice later. I will contact you through the exclusive Gray Cult app." Guo Hao said while trying to hold back his cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"I understand the leader..."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei nodded then she waved her hands to everyone in the room: "Then let's chat online."</p>

    <p>Then. She left the room directly.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School, for some reason, everyone breathed a sigh of relief...</p>

    <p>Just by receiving Maiko Abei, Guo Hao felt that he had lost half his life.</p>

    <p>"Can this person really be trusted?" At this time, Guo Hao asked doubtfully.</p>

    <p>"I think it's okay..." Chen Chao said: "Her expression just now was not fake. She really wanted to put her father in a cage and raise him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He had only heard of "a loving father and a filial son." But he didn't know that there was also "a loving father and a filial daughter"...</p>
