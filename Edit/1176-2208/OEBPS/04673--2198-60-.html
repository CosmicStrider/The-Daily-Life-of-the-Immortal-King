  <h1>Chapter 2198 60 Outdoor Training</h1>

  <div>

    <p>All I can say is that arriving early is worse than arriving late.</p>

    <p>For Sun Rong, this visit was actually quite sudden. She only thought of using Lao Huang as an excuse to stay with Wang Ling for a while because Guo Hao and Chen Chao were not around. That's all.</p>

    <p>Just chatting won't lead to much. So we followed Sun Rong's original plan. She wanted to invite Lao Huang to dine together at a hotel owned by the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>In this way, she could spend pleasant time with Wang Ling until midnight in the name of enjoying delicious food. In the end, she was looking for a way to say that she was afraid of going home alone. Let Wang Ling give it to herself Send it home or something...</p>

    <p>But this excuse worked before. Now it seems a bit forced.</p>

    <p>She, the Number 1 Foundation Building on Earth, was promoted to Golden Core not long ago. In Aohai's original state, there were not many people on Earth who could defeat her. Now it's even worse.</p>

    <p>At this time Sun Rong suddenly felt a little regretful. She even planned to return the nine-core Aohai to Wang Ling. Being strong is a good thing, but this greatly hindered the relationship between her and Wang Mutou. Development!</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, Sun Rong thought about many follow-up plans. It was not until Lao Huang received the interview task that her rhythm was disrupted again.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, what are you thinking about?" Lao Huang asked, seeing Sun Rong looking a little hesitant and absent-minded.</p>

    <p>"No... it's nothing..."Sun Rong How dare she express her thoughts so directly. This would make her look very cunning.</p>

    <p>However, these methods are also what Sun Rong heard from Jiang Yingying. They were learned from various love girl comics. According to the general plot, lovers seem to develop in this order.</p>

    <p>This is totally a case of urgent medical treatment. Sun Rong I don't know if stealing is really effective. But as long as it can "conquer" Wang Ling, she really doesn't mind giving it a try.</p>

    <p>But now, Lao Huang has to go on a mission. The plan to treat Lao Huang to dinner has come to nothing. This made Sun Rong sigh involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Sometimes plans really can't keep up with changes...</p>

    <p>Lao Huang looked at Sun Rong, as if he had seen through Sun Rong's inner thoughts. He immediately laughed and said, "I see you two are very interested in my mission. Do you want to come and participate too?" Where's next?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. Is this okay?" Sun Rong's eyes lit up again.</p>

    <p>After all, for her, as long as she can find an opportunity, she can have an excuse to be with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These are necessary measures to avoid embarrassing Wang Ling, a patient with social phobia. Although Sun Rong does not want to be followed by light bulbs when he and Wang Ling go out. But there are There's just no way around it.</p>

    <p>She wanted to express her feelings. But she was worried that she would express her feelings too violently and scare Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The beautiful emotions of youth are mostly in this ignorant budding state. The rarest memories are always the various extreme pulls before breaking through this layer of window paper.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sun Rong doesn't know how long it will last with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's possible, Miss Sun. There was a notice in the interview group before. You can bring up to two foreign players who are no more than the mid-stage Golden Core. I'll take a look at the realms of the two..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I just entered the early stage of Golden Core!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "My Foundation Building."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang nodded with satisfaction: "Well, that's no problem. And you are still students at school. I believe the others won't have any objections."</p>

    <p>"Outdoor training." At this time, Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"right!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong then nodded: "It just so happens that we have outdoor training this semester! This is not considered unprofessional!"</p>

    <p>Outdoor training at Xiuzhen High School.</p>

    <p>This is almost a necessary course for every school year in every Xiuzhen high school. Students must use the knowledge they have learned in school to complete an outdoor practical training assignment within the specified number of years. It can be to assist in maintaining urban security. It can also be in Internship in a specific company. You only need to record the video at the end and have relevant personnel certify the experience of the task.</p>

    <p>In fact, it depends on the number of times the earth has been saved. Wang Ling has already completed his outdoor training homework...</p>

    <p>But those things are not suitable for filming on video.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's King's Eyes has the ability to restore scenes. The events he experienced can be imported into the computer by plugging in the typy-C interface and restored into data videos.</p>

    <p>But these videos are a bit too exaggerated to submit for homework. Each one looks like a special effects blockbuster. Wang Ling Even if it is really shown, people will question it as synthetic.</p>

    <p>After all, in the eyes of many people, he is just a scumbag.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling doesn't care about other people's opinions, since it is an assignment, Wang Ling feels that it is better for him to hand in an assignment that is in line with his "Foundation Building Stage" abilities.</p>

    <p>Help Lao Huang find stowaway aliens. From Wang Ling's perspective, this is a question that will give you points.</p>

    <p>"But now the problem is..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong touched his chin and asked: "There is only one mission released so far. No more information is provided about this group of smuggled aliens. How can we find this? Songhai City is so big. How can we find it in such a big place? To find such a group of stowaway aliens in a big city. If we don't bump into them by chance, it would be like finding a needle in a haystack."</p>
