  <h1>Chapter 2045 The list of decadent and prosperous years</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the power of a single glance, the supreme world of Xianfengnian was immediately plunged into a bloody storm.</p>

    <p>All the eyes of insight in this supreme world have failed. They were destroyed by the power of King's Eyes. Even if the mortal years have the ability to restore them, it will take a short time to complete the eyes of insight in the entire supreme world. Repair is obviously impossible.</p>

    <p>He has been sleeping for too long. He has been waiting for a genius who can compete with him.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling appeared in front of him. Xuefengnian thought he would feel excited. But he didn't know why. Wang Ling's sudden show of power just now made his face almost ecstatic. He froze for that short moment.</p>

    <p>"Who are you? Even in all eternity, there has never been a record of people like you." From eternity to ancient times, Xianfengnian knew all the young geniuses who were similar to his own deeds.</p>

    <p>He even has a special directory in his hand that records everyone's information. It's called {The List of the Year of Decay}.</p>

    <p>Since inheriting the Heavenly Dao tradition, he has omitted those top talents from the list.</p>

    <p>He had also killed these young geniuses from the Sun family, and Sun Ru was also one of the people he put on the list.</p>

    <p>But now Wang Ling was standing in front of him. He had no impression.</p>

    <p>Today, he has spanned countless time from ancient times to the present. Even Xianfengnian himself can't remember how many years have passed. However, the alien cells that are constantly multiplying in his body tell Xianfengnian.</p>

    <p>If he were born now, he would be an existence that spanned the past and present, and swept the entire universe of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Back then, his list only included those geniuses with similar deeds.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that none of those trash that people call geniuses can fight.</p>

    <p>Now I want him to be listed again.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng, Peng Xiren, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were all ignored by him.</p>

    <p>So what if he is the Eternal Emperor?</p>

    <p>Even if the four emperors come together, they may not be his match now.</p>

    <p>Invincible is so lonely.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he has been waiting for a good harvest. He wants to wait for someone who can wake him up from the ancient tripod.</p>

    <p>To announce his comeback again.</p>

    <p>It's just that he didn't expect that he had waited for so long. He didn't wait for those eternal beings who were once so high.</p>

    <p>But what awaited was an extremely young boy.</p>

    <p>Even though a cultivator cannot determine his or her age based on appearance. Some people have advanced moral practices but still look like teenagers. Some people are old but their moral conduct is still lacking.</p>

    <p>Time leaves different traces on each cultivator. Therefore, the criterion for judging whether a cultivator is young or not is the "vigor" on his body.</p>

    <p>This method of identification can be achieved with a little research after the Nascent Soul period.</p>

    <p>The young cultivator is full of energy. His body is as radiant as a little sun.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that Wang Ling's strength is so astonishing. That Taoist practice must be very profound. Generally speaking, a powerful person like this cannot see the "little sun."</p>

    <p>It is almost late. The loss of vitality is a natural phenomenon. It will not affect the growth of the realm.</p>

    <p>For example, Xifengnian. He himself can no longer see the vitality at all.</p>

    <p>Although he only looks like a young man, in fact, as a cultivator who has spanned from ancient times to the present, the dazzling brilliance of his youth has long since disappeared.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the vitality he felt from Wang Ling shocked Xifengnian.</p>

    <p>There is a little sun here.</p>

    <p>It's clearly a Scutum star...</p>

    <p>Does such a person really exist?</p>

    <p>Are you sure it is a life form born from normal carbon-based organisms?</p>

    <p>The Year of Death is completely terrifying.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling's strength is not only terrifying. The key is that he is also extremely young.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current visual inspection, the boy in front of me seems to be only a teenager...</p>

    <p>Of course. It was Wang Ling's intention to show off his vitality to Xian Fengnian. He wanted to test Xian Fengnian's reaction.</p>

    <p>Gu Zi did not expect that this young man would not hide his expression at all.</p>

    <p>He was stunned on the spot. The previous arrogance, contempt, and self-confidence seemed to be completely crushed by his vibrant young life at this moment.</p>

    <p>Such a sense of gap. Wang Ling is actually understandable.</p>

    <p>A person. And he was a young man who was considered a genius in ancient times.</p>

    <p>After inheriting the cells of the Outer God, he thought that he would become invincible as long as time passed.</p>

    <p>So he has been squatting in the ancient cauldron, waiting for fate to arrange for another genius to "activate" him. Then, after killing and destroying this genius, he announced his comeback to the world.</p>

    <p>Now he is finally here... Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is really too young. Far beyond what he thought.</p>

    <p>He has endured from ancient times to the present. He has spanned countless lonely nights. As a result, a seventeen-year-old boy burst out with unimaginable strength.</p>

    <p>And the key point is. No matter how you look at it, I feel that Wang Ling is not playing seriously.</p>

    <p>"Between you and me, someone must die today!"</p>

    <p>Xuefengnian could not accept such an ending. He vowed to kill Wang Ling. Powerful spiritual energy erupted from his body. The shackles that were still comfortable in his hands were shattered into powder by him in an instant. Each piece of order was mixed with the aura of chaos. The chain spans from the sky of this supreme world!</p>

    <p>"It's interesting. I can control more than a hundred chains of chaos." Wang Ying said. He calmly observed the battle in Wang Ling's spiritual world.</p>

    <p>Chaos Lock. This is a chain condensed from the energy of chaos. A Chaos Lock has the power of 10 cores.</p>

    <p>The combat power standard after reaching the Dao Ancestor realm is calculated based on nucleons. The power of one core can easily destroy a planet.</p>

    <p>A chain of chaos is equivalent to ten nuclei. The power can be imagined.</p>

    <p>And he can control more than a hundred at the same time. This is enough to prove that the strength of Xufengnian is far superior to that of Peng Xiren. Even the monk Jin Deng is not his opponent.</p>

    <p>After Dao Ancestor. There are Human Ancestor, Earthly Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor, Ancestor King, Ancestor Immortal...</p>

    <p>The present decadent and abundant years have reached the state of Ancestor King.</p>

    <p>If this mad dog is released, it will truly be a god blocking the killing god.</p>

    <p>To be honest. Wang Ling is also a little scared in his heart. But the reason he is scared is not because of how strong the realm of decay and harvest is... but because Mr. Sun, the boss of Sun Yiyuan, has been the founder of the Sun family for so many years. Didn't attract the attention of Xifeng Nian.</p>

    <p>From this point of view, the Sun family's blessings are indeed profound.</p>

    <p>He really saved the universe in his previous life...</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it also shows how important it is to use the password to open the door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This violent break in the door attracted the attention of the ancient cauldron mad dog.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of Chaos Chains were connected like dense spider webs. They came from all directions and attacked Wang Ling. They rained down together with blood all over the sky.</p>

    <p>They are like giant steel dragons. They shake the sky of this supreme world. Everywhere is shaking.</p>

    <p>Facing this scene. Wang Ling stood calmly on the spot.</p>

    <p>The next second, a huge shadow swelled up from behind him.</p>

    <p>The old man was shocked and turned pale.</p>

    <p>It was a human-shaped Dharma statue, like a whirlpool of Hongmeng whose face could not be seen clearly!</p>

    <p>There were dots of starlight on its body. It seemed to contain the colorful starlight of the entire universe. It was like glass. It appeared directly behind Wang Ling. It instantly doubled from the normal height of a human figure and expanded to a height of a hundred feet.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>I saw the spirit of the Dharma. Strike it out with one palm!</p>

    <p>With a snap, all the chains of chaos that were attacking from the sky were shattered!</p>

    <p>"Is this the dharma that carbon-based organisms can have?"</p>

    <p>Xuefengnian was shocked. He couldn't figure out what the tall Dharma statue behind Wang Ling was. With one palm, all his chaotic chains were dissolved. It was so tyrannical that it sent chills down the spine!</p>
