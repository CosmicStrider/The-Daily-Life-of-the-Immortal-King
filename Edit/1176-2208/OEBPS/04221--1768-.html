  <h1>Chapter 1768 External evil force</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the alleyway tightly clustered by rows of garden houses, two figures flew past one after the other. Wang Muyu randomly picked up two pebbles on the ground. He retreated while symbolically counterattacking.</p>

    <p>He didn't use too much force. He just casually shot out the stones in his hand.</p>

    <p>The flying speed of the pebbles is astonishing. This ejection is more powerful than the bullet. A pebble can even seriously injure a Soul Formation cultivator.</p>

    <p>However, the visitor's reaction was also very quick. He turned sideways and accurately avoided the shot of his stone. In the end, the stone hit a tile wall, making two loud booming noises.</p>

    <p>The wall was instantly smashed into two huge craters and collapsed on the spot. The entire bungalow was also in a shaky state.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu gritted his teeth. He didn't expect that his casual attack would cause such a commotion. He is a dragon, not a husky. Things like tearing down the house should not happen to him. This will cause trouble for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So thinking of this, Wang Muyu had to go back and use the power gene of the Restoration Dragon to repair the damaged wall. Then he used the teleportation ability of the Space Dragon to escape.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Muyu was about to continue his plan to lure the king into an urn. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly stopped chasing him.</p>

    <p>When he turned around, what Wang Muyu saw was the face with a sly smile. This man wearing a black Fedora hat and a black windbreaker actually stopped in front of a building. Then he started to punch his fist. He gathered his strength and hammered hard against the wall.</p>

    <p>"asshole..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu had no choice but to turn around quickly and repair the damaged building. However, the man remained unyielding and continued to start the next round of destruction.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu knew very well that this man was deliberately holding him back. He gritted his teeth and decided not to continue to lure the man over. This man was a madman. He had to fight quickly. Otherwise, the commotion here would only get louder and louder.</p>

    <p>As the sirens gradually sounded in the distance, Wang Muyu knew that someone might have been affected and called the police. He had to solve the incident at hand as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>However, the alley in front of him is really eye-catching. If he does something here, he will definitely be witnessed by many people. Even if he uses space magic to separate the man and himself. Them disappearing out of thin air will also be recorded by a nearby monitors.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu didn't want to become famous in foreign countries. So after weighing the situation, he chose a long-range killing method.</p>

    <p>In the next second, his pupils released a strange ripple. Little by little ripples were gradually released.</p>

    <p>The man looked at Wang Muyu calmly. The next second he saw the two street lamps beside him. They seemed to be endowed with spirituality and twisted like water snakes. They suddenly entangled his body tightly.</p>

    <p>This is the dragon power of the magnetic gold dragon. It allows Wang Muyu to control all metal objects. It also gives these objects a certain degree of power to turn them into steel beasts and drive them for him.</p>

    <p>This man obviously didn't expect that the two street lights around him could become a killer at this moment. He suddenly wrapped his body tightly, causing his muscles to be squeezed together in an instant, and he almost deformed instantly.</p>

    <p>He could feel that several muscles and blood vessels in his body had been crushed. Blood was clogged inside. He gradually lost consciousness...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Muyu discovered that not only was there no trace of panic or fear on this man's face, but he was still smiling. His smile was mysterious. Scarlet blood seeped out from the gaps between his teeth. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood and flowed on it. On the earth.</p>

    <p>Something weird...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu frowned. He instinctively sensed that something was wrong here. But he couldn't tell what was wrong.</p>

    <p>This man chased him all the way and provoked him. He clearly knew that his strength was far inferior to his, but he still pulled him and tried to fight with him.</p>

    <p>It's like... deliberately chasing him. Provoking him.</p>

    <p>Then let yourself be killed with your own hands...</p>

    <p>"Wang Muyu...your real father."</p>

    <p>"Waiting for you..." Just before the man's consciousness was about to disappear completely, a strange and hollow sound came from the man's body. Wang Muyu was not sure if it was the man who said it, but he could see the man looking at him. His eyes are like poisonous snakes. Fierce and ferocious. His real...father?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>What real father!</p>

    <p>His father... obviously is only Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>It turns out. Is this guy here to sow discord between father and son?</p>

    <p>This stimulated Wang Muyu. Just when he was about to clench his fists and control the magnetic gold dragon to use the steel water snake transformed from the street lamp to completely crush the man.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling flew past. He picked up the child's collar and left. In an instant, he teleported to the bottom of a slide in a nearby park. There was a small square space there. No outsiders were here at this time.</p>

    <p>In fact. At that moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has done a lot of things.</p>

    <p>Not just taking away Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>It also neutralized the two steel water snakes and turned them into their original appearance.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he completely restored the nearby buildings. He also helped the innocent foreign man, who was obviously remotely controlled by an evil force, recover from his physical injuries.</p>

    <p>Finally, he used spiritual waves to eliminate the memories of all passers-by in the nearby area and the nearby surveillance equipment.</p>

    <p>The only thing that hasn't been dealt with clearly is the police who came from afar.</p>

    <p>But even if the police arrive at the scene now, it will be of no use because the memories of the witnesses have been wiped out. They can't ask anything.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the more important task at the moment. Wang Ling thinks it is to appease Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>This little guy was obviously frightened. His whole body was trembling.</p>

    <p>He is obviously very powerful, but in that battle just now, Wang Muyu still looked a little younger. There was a lack of details, and he failed to capture well that the man was actually an innocent person controlled by a remote evil force. It was almost crushed by him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels lucky that he arrived in time and did not let this little guy fall into the enemy's conspiracy and become a murderer.</p>

    <p>He looked at the trembling Wang Muyu in front of him. He didn't know how to comfort him. He had never comforted anyone before.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling just walked up and hugged him gently.</p>

    <p>Feeling the familiar smell on Wang Ling. Wang Muyu gradually calmed down: "Daddy..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu thought he was very strong. But what happened just now made him feel that he was really useless for the first time. He didn't even notice the enemy's tricks.</p>

    <p>He blamed himself endlessly. He buried his head into Wang Ling's shoulder and sobbed. In just a moment, Wang Ling felt a large amount of moisture on his shoulder.</p>
