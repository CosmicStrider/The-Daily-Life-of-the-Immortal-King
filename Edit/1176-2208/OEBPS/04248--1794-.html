  <h1>Chapter 1794 Who is not a leader these days?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Bad Navigator thought for a while. It thought that its false surrender would not be noticed. but as an artificial intelligence that already has the ability to think, whatever little thoughts in its mind would also fall into Wang Ling's ears word for word.</p>

    <p>It's not just Wang Ling. Including Wang Muyu, Sun Rong, all of them know the intention of the Bad Navigation.</p>

    <p>But a few people were very smart. They all pretended that nothing happened.</p>

    <p>"Dad, is this navigation stupid?" Wang Muyu said in a voice message.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Muyu is speechless about the bad navigation.</p>

    <p>It's obviously just a navigation. Even if it's made into an animation, it won't have any image. The most it can do is find a voice actor. But I don't know why this wicked navigation likes to add drama to itself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made a hissing gesture, hinting to Wang Muyu to hold still for now. Wang Muyu understood. He turned his little head and pointed out the window and asked, "Where are we going now?"</p>

    <p>"Of course we will act according to the original plan."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "And I just received a message. I heard that Liangzi will be coming soon."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is that Miss Jiugong Liangzi?"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was shocked. She immediately complained: "She came to report in our class a while ago! She came in as a transfer student. In the end, she didn't go to school for a few days at all. I thought she dropped out!"</p>

    <p>"It's not like she dropped out of school... it's just that there are some things that she hasn't completely dealt with yet."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled awkwardly: "After we go to the mall, we will meet Liangzi. The location has been agreed upon."</p>

    <p>"Where?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"The landmark building of Glio City. The Starry Sky Tower. Opposite is another landmark building. The Wisdom Tree." Sun Rong responded.</p>

    <p>In fact, she didn't expect that Jiugong Liangzi would take a risk and come to help her this time.</p>

    <p>But thanks to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This helped her bring back something very important from Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>That is... Gray Cult Leader Token.</p>

    <p>Before getting up, even Sun Rong herself didn't expect that Gray Cult's strength had expanded to the city of Glio.</p>

    <p>Before she left, in order to better manage the Gray Cult in Huaxiu, she temporarily handed over the leader token to Jiugong Liangzi for safekeeping.</p>

    <p>And now, Jiugong Liangzi comes with this leader token.</p>

    <p>This also means.</p>

    <p>She will have the ability to control the Gray Cult cultists hidden throughout the city of Glio...</p>

    <p>The information about Tengu is indeed very extensive.</p>

    <p>But they missed Gray Cult, a cultural organization established for the purpose of literary discussion...</p>

    <p>What about the church?</p>

    <p>Who is not a leader these days?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong already has a package plan in mind.</p>

    <p>She finally went abroad to travel with Wang Ling... all because of Tengu. Her plans were completely disrupted.</p>

    <p>This time, she had to take down this hateful organization in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Bad Navigation successfully parked the car in the basement of Walwolf Supermarket. However, Fang Xing decided to stay in the car with Butler Lin.</p>

    <p>"Hey, Fang Xing, you're not going? You can get it for free! It's free!" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I have already told Chen Chao what I want to buy. He will buy it for me. This navigation is not honest. It is safer for me and Uncle Lin to stay here and watch." Fang Xing said with a smile. He still had that look on his face. Sunny smile. Can't see anything wrong.</p>

    <p>He really didn't trust this unscrupulous navigation system. So when he was in the car, he just pulled out a list and gave it to Chen Chao. He motioned to Chen Chao to buy it for him.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I will buy everything you want for you!" Chen Chao said, beating his chest.</p>

    <p>Then a group of people got out of the car happily.</p>

    <p>After many twists and turns, Wang Ling finally bought the world limited edition crispy noodles that he wanted. He felt a little moved for some reason.</p>

    <p>Walwolf is the largest supermarket in Glio City. At the same time, Glio City is a famous cultivation technology demonstration city in Mixiu Country.</p>

    <p>Even the things sold in the supermarket are full of technology. After Wang Ling bought the "No One Knows Better Than Me the Crispy Noodles Series Crispy Noodles Snack Gift Pack", He followed the others around the supermarket.</p>

    <p>"Brothers, do you want to come and try our latest product? Quantum prosthetic eyes. After installation, the learning efficiency can be doubled with half the effort! And the most important thing is that the combat effectiveness can be quantified!" the female shopping guide introduced with a smile on her face.</p>

    <p>"Then how to use it? You don't want us to pluck out the eyeballs and put them back on, right?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"No, little brother. All cultivation machinery and equipment can be disassembled and installed free of charge for life. There are related stores around the world. Just authenticate with the lifetime anti-counterfeiting code built into cultivation machinery and equipment."</p>

    <p>The female shopping guide said: "This quantum prosthetic eye is the latest product. It comes from Shouchong Technology Group."</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute! Madam, can you say it again? What group?" For a moment, Sun Rong thought she was hearing something.</p>

    <p>"Shou Chong Technology Group is the work of Mr. Shou Chong, a famous scientist from Huaxiu. I heard that the Office of Strategic Deception recently invested in it! This quantum prosthetic eye is made by Mr. Shou Chong and Mr. Wang Xiaoer. A joint masterpiece."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a moment. Wang Ling had an illusion.</p>

    <p>That is to say, Shou Chong and Wang Ming. These two guys must have stolen the technology from Virtual Realm. Technology City!</p>

    <p>It's just that these cultivation machinery and equipment can be mass-produced and sold online at the speed of light in such a short period of time. This is something that Wang Ling never expected.</p>

    <p>On the shelf of cultivation machinery and equipment. In addition to quantum prosthetic eyes, there are indeed many new cultivation machinery and equipment on display. There are all kinds of mechanical arms and legs.</p>

    <p>These things were extremely attractive to the new generation of cultivators, and Chen Chao and Guo Hao were unable to move their legs all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>"After all that you've just said, I still feel like I have to be stingy. Can I try it?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course." The female shopping guide smiled and said: "All cultivation mechanical equipment needs to be installed into the body to achieve 100% effect. Now it can be experienced through external devices. However, the external experience effect can only reach 20%."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, the female shopping guide took out a helmet and said, "Now, I have linked the quantum prosthetic eye selected by Mr. to the sensory helmet. As long as Mr. puts on the helmet, the next picture you see will be seen through the quantum prosthetic eye."</p>

    <p>"That's it!" Chen Chao nodded. He couldn't wait to take the helmet and put it on his head: "I'll try it first!"</p>

    <p>"Brother, please."</p>

    <p>The female shopping guide was smiling. She helped Chen Chao fasten the helmet strap: "After opening your eyes, the relevant functions will appear directly in the menu on the right side of the brother's sight. Just select the corresponding function and follow the system operation instructions."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Chen Chao rubbed his hands.</p>

    <p>Wait until the device starts.</p>

    <p>He only felt a quick "buzz" in his head. Then he heard the electronic sound of "Connection successful" coming from his head.</p>

    <p>A lot of functions related to quantum prosthetic eyes are quickly displayed on the right as the female shopping guide said.</p>

    <p>[Combat Power Measurement]</p>

    <p>[Quantum speed reading]</p>

    <p>[Thermal Scanning]</p>

    <p>[Extreme telephoto]</p>

    <p>[Super perspective]</p>

    <p>[One-click monthly vote]</p>

    <p>[beat Ku Xuan violently in the blink of an eye]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was dazzled by the dazzling array of functions.</p>

    <p>"There is actually super clairvoyance?" Chen Chao was shocked: "Is this... is this legal?"</p>

    <p>"It's legal in our city of Glio." The female shopping guide smiled and said, "Of course. This is a VIP function that needs to be recharged as a member. The specific see-through effect will be graded according to the member. King members are fully see-through! The perspective effect will not be very good for those below the King membership level."</p>

    <p>"I still need to top up money..." Chen Chao clicked his tongue: "Is there a free trial function?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Combat power measurement is free. You can try it on your friends."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>Then the next second, he immediately focused his attention on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The data shows that Wang Ling is in the early stage of Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao immediately laughed: "Hey, Lingzi. It's been half a year since school started, how come you're still in the early stage of foundation building?"</p>

    <p>This ruthless ridicule made Wang Ling secretly sigh in relief.</p>

    <p>It seems that Wang Ming had already taken him into consideration when designing this function. Any scans targeting him would be intelligently masked directly with false data.</p>

    <p>"This prosthetic eye is pretty good."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao played with it for a long time. Then he took off his helmet and let Guo Hao experience it.</p>

    <p>Then, he walked up to Wang Ling and patted Wang Ling on the shoulder: "Honestly, Lingzi, I always thought that you were very strong, but you just pretended to be weak. Now it seems. The misunderstanding is resolved! You are indeed a mascot!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, a mysterious black figure of Wang Ling is being closely observed in the supermarket. He is recording something in a small notebook.</p>

    <p>On the small notebook, the huge title read: "Analysis on the hidden strong man of Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>Then below is the list of people traveling this time.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Li Youyue, Sun Rong and???...</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>When recording the name, he forgot the name of Wang Ling. He didn't know who this person was.</p>

    <p>That's why three question marks are used as marks.</p>

    <p>Until now, I have observed Wang Ling in the dark.</p>

    <p>He finally asked who this Mr. "???" was.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>He used his own pen to completely black out the three question marks.</p>

    <p>Because just now, that Chen Chao had helped him rule out a wrong answer.</p>

    <p>It's just a waste from the initial stage of the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>It's not worthy of their Tengu's attention...</p>
