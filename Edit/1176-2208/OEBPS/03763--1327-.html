  <h1>Chapter 1327 Using shadows to find shadows</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the yin and yang reverse chaos...</p>

    <p>It turned out to be this.</p>

    <p>In a daze, the monk completely understood what the "fortune teller" said back then.</p>

    <p>They have always mistakenly understood Yin and Yang as male and female. They thought that the Son of the Void was a man and a woman.</p>

    <p>But I never expected that the Sons of the Void would be twins.</p>

    <p>The reversal of yin and yang means that the shadow awakens and has its own thoughts.</p>

    <p>But by the time I realize it now, it seems to be too late.</p>

    <p>Now comes the problem. Now "waiting until the yin and yang reverse chaos" has been verified.</p>

    <p>So what does the following sentence "stain the sky with my blood" mean?</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. The monk feels that the second half of the sentence has some connotation...</p>

    <p>"What did the master think of?" Lord Diulei asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"No... nothing..."</p>

    <p>The old monk's face turned red: "This matter is of great importance... The poor monk... The poor monk wants to go to Ling Zhenren to discuss..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Family Villa. Wang Ling quickly received feedback from the monk.</p>

    <p>Sons of the Void with twin constitutions.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling didn't expect this.</p>

    <p>However, this further confirms Wang Ling's initial judgment.</p>

    <p>All along, there was a hand behind the scenes that was secretly fueling the fire and guiding their actions.</p>

    <p>The shadow of Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>What should it be called?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying?</p>

    <p>It sounds like a boy's name.</p>

    <p>It's not cute either.</p>

    <p>"Did Ling Zhenren think of something?" The monk saw Wang Ling looking thoughtful. He was not very curious.</p>

    <p>Monks also have the ability to read minds. However, this ability is only invalid for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Only large mosaics can be read.</p>

    <p>"Name." Wang Ling is concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren means that he is thinking about Miss Sun's shadow. What name should be better." Survival Heavenly Dao worked as a translator on the side.</p>

    <p>"..." The monk was stunned.</p>

    <p>I admire Wang Ling in my heart.</p>

    <p>At this point, I still have time to think about the name... As expected of you!</p>

    <p>At this time, the work of drawing symbols to survive Heavenly Dao has not stopped.</p>

    <p>And now there is no one to help him.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has absorbed the soul of the new female prairie dog. It is being digested. It needs to be in seclusion for a period of time.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma used his teleportation ability to teleport it back to the demon world.</p>

    <p>Now, Er Ha is on the holy pillar of the demon world. It is in retreat with the help of the retreat room dedicated to the second-generation demon saint. It is protected by the holy envoy Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>Only Er Ha can enjoy this kind of treatment.</p>

    <p>All for the sake of Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>If other demon beasts dared to ride on the neck of the demon saint, they would have been beaten to death long ago.</p>

    <p>Surviving Heavenly Dao Thinking of this, I feel more and more that their status as Heavenly Dao is getting smaller and smaller...</p>

    <p>It is estimated that by the time Er Ha comes out of the game, even Er Ha will be able to face Heavenly Dao for output.</p>

    <p>They Heavenly Dao. It's really hard!</p>

    <p>"Sun Ying. It really doesn't sound like a girl's name."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said: "The poor monk has a good idea."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling raised his eyes and stared at the monk. At this moment, the monk said his answer: "It is better to split the word shadow into a word three and a word scenery. Sun Sanjing... this The name. The poor monk thinks it's pretty good!"</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling listened, he was shocked on the spot along with the survivor Heavenly Dao beside him.</p>

    <p>God?? Not bad...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he was a waste of names.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect to meet someone who was more interested in naming than myself...</p>

    <p>"Let's call her Sun Ying..." Wang Ling thought for a long time. Before I felt that there was no better answer, Sun Ying sounded more pleasant to my ears.</p>

    <p>At least. It's much more reliable than the name Sun Sanjing...</p>

    <p>In a daze, Wang Ling remembered the real name of the author of this book.</p>

    <p>After taking it apart, it is called Jin Sanshi.</p>

    <p>Also very rustic...</p>

    <p>"The top priority now is to find Miss Sun Ying's whereabouts," the monk said.</p>

    <p>In fact, I was thinking of a name for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was already looking for Sun Ying. Only magic can defeat magic.</p>

    <p>Spells can defeat spells.</p>

    <p>Naturally. Only the shadow can find the shadow...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying is a natural tool man. Wang Ling cannot be left alone.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling was also curious about what Sun Ying was doing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's cruelty back then. Wang Ling has already experienced it.</p>

    <p>"Don't use your thoughts to judge the personalities of our shadows. Each shadow that awakens its own consciousness has a different personality."</p>

    <p>In the mental space, Wang Ying was crossing her arms and protesting: "Miss Sun Ying, maybe she is a gentle shadow."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>He was not in a hurry to refute. Anyway, as long as Wang Ying found the other party's location, he would know what kind of existence Sun Ying was.</p>

    <p>"You have to be careful."</p>

    <p>Before separating Wang Ying from the mental space. Wang Ling proactively reminds.</p>

    <p>Although he thinks Sun Ying will not be Wang Ying's opponent.</p>

    <p>However, since Sun Ying is another son of the void, it is very likely that he has obtained the full power of the void.</p>

    <p>There are similarities between shadows and ethereal spirits. They are both incorporeal existences.</p>

    <p>And the Son of the Void is different from ordinary Void Spirits.</p>

    <p>If Sun Ying was fully awakened, his combat power would be much stronger than that of the virtual spirit that broke into the spiritual space last time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying ignored Wang Ling's words at all. He turned into a black shadow and quickly fled into the outside world.</p>

    <p>"Let's get going."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling felt like he couldn't stay idle any longer.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to an unspeakable place?" The monk was startled.</p>

    <p>Their scheduled time was originally tomorrow.</p>

    <p>But since we have decided to take action in advance, Monk Jin Deng naturally has no objections: "Since Zhenren thinks it is feasible, then the poor monk will open the way."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the monk took out a map of the extraterrestrial galaxy and spread it out on the ground.</p>

    <p>There are clear coordinates of the unspeakable place on it.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. This is an unspeakable place. It is in the deepest part of the extraterrestrial galaxy. And there are many space traps nearby. Based on the experience of the poor monk who has repeatedly entered them, there are some safety rules. You need to communicate with Ling Zhenren first." Monk After saying that, he pointed at the dozen "red cross" marks on the map.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"These red crosses are places that need to be avoided. Even if you use the power of shrinking to an inch, if you accidentally step inside, it will be extremely troublesome to escape. Although the strength of the poor monk and Ling Zhenren will not escape I can't get away with it. But it still wastes time after all."</p>

    <p>The monk kept talking about what he thought were safety rules.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he finally showed his essence of an old monk chanting sutras: "Zhenren, please look. There are also here, here and here... those places are responsible for the cosmic storm. After being sucked into it, the clothes will disappear. Previously The poor monk fell in several times and lost a lot of cassocks."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. That's it for the poor monk's safety details. The poor monk will lead the way. It will take 3 days to set off from the earth to the unspeakable place."</p>

    <p>Does it need to be so troublesome...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He stood in front of his closet and recited the mantra silently.</p>

    <p>After reopening the closet.</p>

    <p>The wardrobe was filled with stars. It was a sea of stars.</p>

    <p>And the place that symbolizes the unspeakable place, which exists like a floating island in the universe, is right in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It actually takes 3 days to reach the unspeakable place?</p>

    <p>Three seconds.</p>

    <p>That's enough.</p>
