  <h1>Chapter 1726 Love Brain</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong's strength is obviously only in the Foundation Building stage. However, it can quietly enter this spiritual space with such an attitude. It even merges with the sea water. You can feel its strength just by looking at it. How strong is it?</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong... and Mr. Ming. I'm really curious. Is Miss Rong really in the Foundation Building period?" Shou Chong stared at Sun Rong's posture of man and sword united at this time. He couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"Senior Shou Chong. I am indeed in the Foundation Building stage! I am so innocent... Foundation Building stage!" Sun Rong laughed. In fact, she has been stuck in the late Foundation Building stage for a long time. She has not found it yet. A good way to break through the bottleneck. It's like being locked out of health.</p>

    <p>Previously, she was eager to improve her level of strength. She was still worried that if the gap in combat power between Aohai and herself was too big, she would be unable to control Aohai and lose control.</p>

    <p>But the previous explanation by monk Jin Deng completely dispelled Sun Rong's concerns.</p>

    <p>So now. Sun Rong is relieved that I am still in the Foundation Building stage. I don't think there is anything wrong.</p>

    <p>"It's incredible..." Shou Chong sighed. There was a feeling that the world view was refreshed.</p>

    <p>He knew that all this happened because of Wang Ling... That was the boy with dead fish eyes that Jiugong Liangzi asked him to find.</p>

    <p>So what is the relationship between the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family and the eldest daughter of the Huaguo Shuilian Group in front of her?</p>

    <p>Because at this time Shou Chong did not know the news that the two had reconciled. Therefore, in his thinking and cognition, it suddenly dawned on him almost instantly...</p>

    <p>These two little girls must be jealous over Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>No wonder it was so easy to cheat him out of his research funding...</p>

    <p>Girls in love are prone to destroying the world and losing their minds!</p>

    <p>As someone who has been there, Shou Chong also has a rich and emotional relationship history. Naturally, he also knows how crazy one party in love can do, especially those with a love brain.</p>

    <p>He felt that maybe he could get closer to Sun Rong through his love experience.</p>

    <p>After all, he has become like this now...</p>

    <p>Because he was killed by Master Wu Xin and his senior sister Fengchu, the research laboratory was destroyed. The previous research data may no longer exist. Fortunately, he has a powerful brain that can be called a mobile cloud disk. He still remembers those data.</p>

    <p>As for the most important meteorite fragment that he named "Eternity", it was originally stored in a more secret place by him. No one else knew where it was hidden.</p>

    <p>If he goes out in the future, rebuilding the research laboratory will require a huge amount of financial support. So how to please the young lady in front of him seems to be crucial.</p>

    <p>After Sun Rong joined, Wang Ming and Shou Chong's efficiency was obviously twice the result with half the effort. Because Sun Rong has the ability to manipulate sea water. There is no need for Wang Ming and Shou Chong to search specifically. No matter what they are looking for, as long as Sun Rong has the ability to control sea water. Just say Sun Rong and things will be pushed directly to your eyes by the waves.</p>

    <p>And in the subsequent process of searching for parts, disassembling parts and assembling parts, Wang Ming discovered that Shou Chong's problems seemed to suddenly become more numerous...</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong, how long have you been in love with that classmate Wang Ling?" Shou Chong asked while assembling the parts. He looked casual. But this question was directed to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushed instantly: "This... I don't know how to answer you. Senior Shou Chong..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>Obviously, Shou Chong didn't know. At this time, in the sword spirit space inside Sun Rong's body, several people and Wang Ling were peeking at the screen.</p>

    <p>They were brought in by Sun Rong. And they couldn't get out because once they got out, there was a possibility of alerting the enemy.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong also knows that this question is actually a bit rude. If he knew that Wang Ling was here, he would never ask this question...</p>

    <p>But now. He just doesn't know that Wang Ling is hidden in the sword spirit space of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It's not just him. Even Wang Ming doesn't know.</p>

    <p>As a member of "LingRong Party", Wang Ming will naturally not miss any opportunity to tease Sun Rong+ assist matchmaking.</p>

    <p>Seeing Shou Chong asking this question, he couldn't help but echoed: "To be honest, I have always been curious. Rongrong, what do you like about that kid? Just because he ignored you and said hello on his first day of school? It inspired me. Does it satisfy your curiosity?"</p>

    <p>This question couldn't help but make Sun Rong laugh: "At first... there was a little bit of anger in it, but later on, I found that it was no longer the case. I think Wang Ling... once he likes someone, he must be a single-minded person."</p>

    <p>"Why?" Wang Ming and Shou Chong asked in unison.</p>

    <p>"Because he is so dedicated to crispy noodles. Who can be so keen on the same snack? He even has to keep it by his side when eating and sleeping." Sun Rong said seriously.</p>

    <p>"That's true." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>"In love, the one who takes the initiative always suffers the most. But sometimes I really like you when I can't stand you." At this time, Shou Chong couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>This aspect aroused the curiosity of Sun Rong: "It sounds like Senior Shou Chong is a person with stories?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. Of course there is a story." Shou Chong said with a smile: "Actually, to be honest with you, one of my ex-girlfriends is my senior sister. That is the Mrs. Fengchu you dealt with before."</p>

    <p>"Fengchu is your ex-girlfriend?" Wang Ming was shocked: "Your circle is really chaotic..."</p>

    <p>"Between brothers and sisters from the same sect, when they perform many tasks together, they will always have some emotions other than the same sect."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong laughed: "My senior sister broke into my laboratory earlier to capture me. Although I know that those who broke in were not her. They were just clones created by her. But my senior sister's clone stepped on me. At that time, you know, I actually recalled those years."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Shou Chong sighed: "Hey, you young people must not understand how comfortable it is to be stepped on by a powerful lady in black stockings. To put it bluntly, this is a special kind of thing. My senior sister Fengchu was also a very charming woman when she was still young. At that time, it was my senior sister who chased me and used this kind of charm to lure me in."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>"So Miss Sun Rong, don't look at classmate Wang Ling. He is a serious person. The more serious a person is, the crazier he will be if he falls in love in the end. And nine times out of ten, he will have certain hobbies."</p>

    <p>After thinking about it for a while, Shou Chong clicked his tongue. He looked at Sun Rong and said with a smile: "It's not necessarily like me, who likes to be stepped on and played with by his senior sister. Maybe he has other hobbies. Classmate Wang Ling, his strength is extraordinary. It seems that the physical strength is also excellent. Once the motor starts, it may not be able to stop.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>
