  <h1>Chapter 1183 The image of 2 clams</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Multiple clone techniques instantly isolate the battlefield. Xiao Yin and Wang Zhen are separated. Smoke rises in the field in an instant. Jiang Yingyue's cunning is beyond imagination. This is not a simple clone technique. It is a self-destruction clone technique. Once The clone will explode immediately if it encounters external force.</p>

    <p>The explosion power of a shadow clone is equivalent to 10 C4 bombs.</p>

    <p>If so many shadow clones explode together, at such a close range without adequate protection, the Soul Formation will definitely be seriously injured! The power of such a bomb will also affect a wide range. By then, the entire stalactite cave will be destroyed. It was razed to the ground. The nearby area within a radius of 5 kilometers will be affected.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Zhen and Xiao Yin feel that such a bomb will not kill them, once it detonates, it will definitely have a great impact on the ecology of the Jiulong Mountain area.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that this stalactite cave is also very close to the main valve of Tianmai...</p>

    <p>The consequences of the explosion are unimaginable.</p>

    <p>The Tianmai General Valve was nearby. Wang Zhen originally thought that the other party would not be so serious. However, it turned out that Jiang Yingyue's craziness was not weaker than the three Menshi brothers at the door.</p>

    <p>She didn't care about the Tianmai General Valve's problems at all. Instead, she devoted all her energy to the battle in front of her.</p>

    <p>The person behind the scenes resurrected so many people. Their main purpose was to delay time. Therefore, the victory or defeat of this battle seemed to have no meaning at all in Wang Zhen's eyes.</p>

    <p>However, this is an unavoidable battle. If Jiang Yingyue cannot be eliminated, they will not be able to go further.</p>

    <p>As the third killer on the epic killer list, Jiang Yingyue's most familiar ability is "explosion." The so-called explosion is art. The lethality brought by close-range blasting is self-evident... As an expert in blasting, He is called an expert-level figure. Jiang Yingyue is also particularly confident in his abilities.</p>

    <p>Especially after she successfully activated "Shadow." She has the ability to plant bombs through her shadow!</p>

    <p>--Shadow Blast Goddess!</p>

    <p>This is the name of her photo.</p>

    <p>"The person who resurrected me gave me a very powerful power. My shadow can implant any shadow it comes into contact with into a bomb. What do you think you have a chance of winning against me?" Jiang Yingyue showed a sly smile. She is confident that her current strength is not enough to deal with a green-haired dog. The bonus of the power of shadow gives Jiang Yingyue a lot of confidence.</p>

    <p>This is a power that Jiang Yingyue has never seen before. But it can double her overall strength in a short period of time. If she had this ability, Ghost Ax Spirit Mother met her. The ending is 100% only by being blown up by her.</p>

    <p>But now. Ghost Ax Spirit Mother has been killed by the green-haired dog in front of her... So, as long as she kills this dog, she can still prove her status as the ancestor of the killer world!</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Jiang Yingyue's eyes began to get excited. Her image was that of a bookish girl. She was wearing a Lolita purple dress and holding an umbrella with a time scale.</p>

    <p>This is the true form of Shadow Blast Lady. As long as it is covered by the umbrella in her hand, the shadow will be immediately equipped with a time bomb.</p>

    <p>This is a very tricky photography skill. At least in Er Ha's opinion, it is far more powerful than the three brothers guarding the door.</p>

    <p>"With my Shadow Blast Lady here, you have no chance of winning..." Jiang Yingyue raised her hand and began to control the Shadow Blast Lady to capture Er Ha's image. During the confrontation, Er Ha's figure could only jump around. Channeling. For a moment, Jiang Yingyue seemed to have complete control over the situation.</p>

    <p>"No! We have to find a way! If this continues, Er Ha's shadow will be caught sooner or later!" Xiao Yin is not optimistic about the situation in front of her. The Shadow Blast Goddess moves very fast, far beyond imagination. Once Caught. Death is just a countdown.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has not truly entered the realm of a holy beast. Its self-healing ability is far less powerful than that of a holy beast. Once it is blown to pieces, there is absolutely no possibility of restoration unless Ling Zhenren takes action himself.</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute." Wang Zhen seemed much calmer and calmer than Xiao Yin. He had seen too many such battles. The outcome of all battles could not be determined until the last moment. Er Ha seemed to be at a disadvantage. But in fact Wang Zhen could see that Er Ha was looking for the right way to respond.</p>

    <p>"Do you think you still have a chance of winning... Even the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother back then, I still don't take it seriously now. Let alone you, a mere green-haired dog?" Jiang Yingyue's smile was extremely confident. She Manipulating his own image, he launched an offensive against Er Ha unscrupulously. Although Er Ha was constantly dodging, this seemed to Jiang Yingyue to be nothing more than a trick.</p>

    <p>These thousand-year-old stalactites in the Stalactite Cave have absorbed the natural spiritual power, causing the environment here to have a natural fluorescent effect. Any creature that sets foot here will inevitably be cast a shadow!</p>

    <p>In other words, this is what Jiang Yingyue thinks is the best attack direction! As long as she can cast a shadow, it will always be her advantage!</p>

    <p>"Mother Ghost Axe... is not something you can shake." Er Ha said to Jiang Yingyue earnestly. Mother Wang's status in the Wang family is beyond imagination. If Jiang Yingyue really doesn't have the guts to dare to attack Mother Wang starts... let alone Father Wang. Wang Ling will personally go out to skin Jiang Yingyue!</p>

    <p>So Er Ha felt there was something fishy about this matter from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>He felt that the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother Jiang Yingyue met might not be Mother Wang herself. There are many charlatans pretending to be traffic stars these days. The possibility of encountering a liar is still very high.</p>

    <p>Taking a step back, if the person you meet is really Mother Wang, and Mother Wang has actually been preserving her strength as the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Er Ha feels that it is impossible for her Wang Ling little master to not be aware of it at all.</p>

    <p>So to sum up, the probability of Jiang Yingyue meeting the fake Mother Wang may be higher.</p>

    <p>But now it is obvious that no matter what kind of explanation Er Ha gives, Jiang Yingyue will not listen. She is eager for revenge. Since her resurrection, she has been looking forward to the second battle with the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother...</p>

    <p>When she mistakenly believed that the legendary "Ghost Ax Spirit Mother", the ancestor of the killer world, died in her own hands, the impulse that had been accumulated for a long time and suppressed for a long time finally broke out. And she vented it all to the extreme. Er Ha's head.</p>

    <p>"If you are stubborn, then I have no choice but to use my methods..." Er Ha sighed. He didn't want to show off his photography ability in advance before meeting the person behind the scenes. But now it seems... Jiang Yingyue The image is indeed too tricky.</p>

    <p>The ability to plant a bomb on the shadow once it touches it is truly incredible...</p>

    <p>In desperation, Er Ha had no choice but to send his own photos for a photo shoot showdown.</p>

    <p>His photo is called: Gou's Fortress!</p>

    <p>An ability that can instantly form a defensive barrier. The ability to turn one's own shadow into a castle! A mere bomb! An indestructible castle to him!</p>

    <p>Er Ha has absolute confidence to win this game!</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's dog. He must not be embarrassed!</p>
