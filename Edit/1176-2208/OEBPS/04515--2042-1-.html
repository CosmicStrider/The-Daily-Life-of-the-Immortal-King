  <h1>Chapter 2042 The ancestral attributes are indeed inherited from the same origin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It takes a genius to remember the address of this website in one second: []https://Fastest updates! No ads!</p>

    <p>The power of Wang Ling is far beyond Sun Ru's knowledge. To be honest, as a cultivator in ancient times, Sun Ru thinks that he is not as good as his ancestors in the ancient times. But in the end, it is the pride of the family to be able to handle it.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he would not have been sent to the ancient battlefield to participate in the peace defense war led by the Sun family.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Ru thinks that she has seen a lot of people in the market. For example, her grandma Sun Fu is very strong. Sun Ru still remembers that she was shocked by her grandma's magical operations time and time again when she was a child. She even thought that her grandma Sun Fu was very powerful. Grandma Sun Fu may be the first person under the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>But now. This perception has been broken by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Mr. "Sun Ling" in front of him. The injection of spiritual power from his palm directly revitalized the ancient immortal spring pool that can restore the injuries of millions of cultivators. This is too scary!</p>

    <p>Realizing that her mouth could not be restrained from opening, Sun Ru was stunned for a long time before regaining her composure.</p>

    <p>She remembered that she had heard her ancestors' analysis of the general trend of cultivation in the future. Due to the constant wars between ancient cultivators, the earth's spiritual energy was bound to be depleted. Therefore, in the future cultivation world, the overall level of cultivators will be far lower than that of the old era. Cultivators.</p>

    <p>Unless other ways can be found to help the earth's overall spiritual veins become stronger than before. In order to achieve a method of turning the earth's spiritual energy over to support the cultivation and consumption of all human cultivators.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if things continue like this, it will only be a matter of time before cultivators die.</p>

    <p>In other words, future cultivators...shouldn't they be more crotch-stretching at the realm level?</p>

    <p>Why can the current head of their Sun family be so outrageous?</p>

    <p>Sun Ru considers herself to be a person who doesn't show her expression easily. Everyone who sees her thinks that she always looks awake and cute. This actually gives Sun Ru an excellent battlefield. Disguise.</p>

    <p>So on the ancient battlefield, those who despised her because of her expression all became her victims.</p>

    <p>But now. The impact Wang Ling has brought to her is too great. Sun Ru's expression management and emotional management have completely lost control.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru? We can take action." At this time, Immortal Toya's voice came.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has been waiting by the immortal spring pool for a long time.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Sun Ru had not calmed down for a long time, Immortal Toya gave a warning.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru's face turned red, perhaps because she realized that she had revealed an unseen look.</p>

    <p>It was not until this moment that Wang Ling further confirmed the blood connection between Sun Ru and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Good guy...the attributes of this "Steam Girl" are actually passed down from ancestors!</p>

    <p>After jumping into the immortal spring pool with Sun Ru, Wang Ling immediately felt that a space tunnel was opened at the bottom of the immortal spring pool. A seven-color vortex opened directly. The people who jumped into the pool were quickly People swallow it together.</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses. Wang Ling, Sun Ru had suddenly appeared on the fourth map of the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>This is a place full of smoke and clouds. There are shining clouds and mist everywhere. A long carpet filled with starlight runs along Wang Ling, and Sun Ru's feet lead directly to the simple and magnificent gate in front of the sky.</p>

    <p>This is the fourth map after the Sun family's ancestral land has a cave, an ice purgatory, and an ancient battlefield: Xiaonantianmen.</p>

    <p>According to Sun Ru, the structure here is an illusion corridor created by replicating the legendary Nantianmen in ancient books one to one. The small Nantianmen is right in sight. But if the correct method is not found, get rid of the inner demons. You can never get close to the other side.</p>

    <p>Of course. Sun Ru herself knows how to crack it.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, in order to save time, she should lead the way for the current head of the Sun family... But now, Sun Ru wants to see it even more. Wang Ling Faced with this little Nantianmen whom she has never seen before, this current Sun Ru What kind of amazing performance will the head of the family have?</p>

    <p>In fact, when I saw the small Nantianmen in front of me, Wang Ling instantly thought of the Heavenly Court where the Heavenly Dao little Golden Men lived.</p>

    <p>The starlight road in front of us is also very similar to the road leading to the Heavenly Dao Committee controlled by the Six Lords Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>So is the construction of the fourth map really based on the legendary ancient books?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has doubts about this.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the origin of the ancestor of the Sun family is extraordinary. He must have been to heaven to achieve such a reproduction. Otherwise, it would never be possible to restore it like this.</p>

    <p>Everything in front of you seems unreal to those who come here for the first time. Everything around is blurry. There is only the starlight road under your feet and the small Nantianmen in the distance that seems to be very close at hand.</p>

    <p>All kinds of auras and colorful mist are intertwined. It's like boiling water in the ice and snow polar regions is constantly evaporating.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still maintained a calm attitude, walking on the Avenue of Stars with his trousers in his pockets.</p>

    <p>While walking, Sun Ru showed a surprised expression from time to time. That was because the illusion effect here aroused the fear deep in her heart.</p>

    <p>However, the strange thing is that these illusions did not completely form, but simply dissipated.</p>

    <p>She has never seen anything like this.</p>

    <p>According to her understanding, the illusion here can condense into its true form, and it can really cause physical harm to people! But now, Sun Ru has never heard of such a situation that it wilts before it even takes shape.</p>

    <p>What made Sun Ru even more outrageous was that she followed Wang Ling all the way. It only took less than five minutes to walk directly to the entrance of Xiaonantianmen.</p>

    <p>Five minutes...</p>

    <p>Walk!</p>

    <p>How is this possible!</p>

    <p>There is a special way to deal with the illusion of this Avenue of Stars. If we had not cracked the illusion and found the key nodes on the Avenue of Stars, we would never have been able to reach this little Nantianmen!</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru. Illusion is ineffective against Ling Zhenren. That's why he was able to come here unimpeded." Immortal Toya sighed. He was not surprised by Sun Ru's appearance that he had never seen the market before. Take the time to explain.</p>

    <p>"What...the illusion doesn't work?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ru was startled: "That's not right. I remember that Lord Ancestor's Fire Eye Golden Dragon was kept by himself. He didn't pass it on to anyone else."</p>

    <p>"..." Immortal Toya was silent.</p>

    <p>He knows that the King's Eyes of Wang Ling is several dimensions stronger than this flaming-eyed golden beast. There is absolutely no meaning of comparison.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru thought about it. The thoughts in her mind couldn't help but wander. Her thinking began to leap and jump. She thought of a sexy operation that normal people could not think of: "Oh my god..."</p>

    <p>"What is Senior Sun Ru thinking?"</p>

    <p>"Heir of Laojun, you have to tell me honestly. Did our current head of the Sun family dig up the ancestor's grave... and dig out the golden eye of the ancestor..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was speechless. I was shocked by this conclusion.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru's idea is so amazing."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya couldn't hold it back. He complained directly: "How is that possible, Senior Sun Ru! This is too filial! Ling Zhenren is not even familiar with the Sun family's ancestral land. If they have dug graves... I still need you to lead the way here." ?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Sun Ru suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He confirmed again. What attributes did Sun Rong inherit from his ancestors?</p>

    <p>This ancestral "Steam Girl" and this ancestral "brain supplement ability"... are really too strong...</p>
