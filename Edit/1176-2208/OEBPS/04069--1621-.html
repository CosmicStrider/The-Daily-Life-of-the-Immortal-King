  <h1>Chapter 1621 Jiang Yingying. Danger again!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the middle of the night, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui came to the apartment downstairs where Jiang Yingying lived.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying originally lived in a cadre apartment. Mr. Jiang wanted to take care of his granddaughter's daily life and develop a habit. Today's young people order takeout every day. The food tastes particularly unhealthy.</p>

    <p>But after Jiang Yingying transferred to Number 60 High School, he begged him to move out. He chose an apartment closer to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is mainly due to Jiang Yingying's own selfishness.</p>

    <p>She originally wanted to stop Wang Ling on her way to school.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying has read countless youth comics with campus themes. Almost all of them have this kind of plot.</p>

    <p>For example, the hero and heroine met by chance on the way to school. Because they were late, they bumped into each other... and because of this wonderful fate, they developed feelings for each other...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying couldn't help but feel her face getting hot every time she thought of this. She held her face in her hands and slapped her slender calves, lying on the bed and thinking about it.</p>

    <p>She felt that if there was such a plot, it must be very romantic.</p>

    <p>However in fact.</p>

    <p>If it really collides with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Definitely not that romantic...</p>

    <p>Because it's obvious. This is going to be the scene of a car accident.</p>

    <p>The impact of the backlash after actively colliding with Wang Ling. For Jiang Yingying, it was the same as being repeatedly run over by a heavy truck of dozens of tons.</p>

    <p>Then there is no more.</p>

    <p>There are all kinds of liquids on the ground. But there is no Jiang Yingying...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>However, adolescent girls still maintain fantasies. In fact, this is also a sign of cuteness.</p>

    <p>And Jiang Yingying's results did not disappoint.</p>

    <p>As an old gang bully and an old unlucky guy, she has never met Wang Ling once since she moved to an apartment near Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>But she doesn't believe in evil. She still wakes up early every day and squats at the gate waiting for Wang Ling to show up.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling has long seen through Jiang Yingying's idea.</p>

    <p>He found Jiang Yingying very troublesome. It was more troublesome than when he first met Sun Rong in the first semester of high school...</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, there is no harm without comparison.</p>

    <p>Now with Jiang Yingying's template. Wang Ling suddenly felt that Sun Rong was great.</p>

    <p>In comparison. Sun Rong is really much more sensible and mature than Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that now Sun Rong will take the initiative to share some of his troubles. And all he has to pay is a few insignificant white rabbit toffee and being secretly liked by other girls.</p>

    <p>This seems to be a free trade for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's impossible for him to really fall in love with Sun Rong. What does it matter?</p>

    <p>Not to mention now. It won't be possible in the future.</p>

    <p>And now. He has no interest in Sun Rong at all... That's right. Not at all!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has made the same decision in his heart countless times.</p>

    <p>Including the last time he went to Palm Cliff to rescue Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally wrote in his private diary in his own space. He summarized the incident in six words: a strong friendship between classmates...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Li Xian and Zhang Zhui agreed to meet at the bottom of the apartment building where Jiang Yingying lived, the time was six o'clock in the evening on Thursday, December 24.</p>

    <p>The two of them checked the time on their mobile phones.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you just slip in through the back door."</p>

    <p>"Brother Zi Xiang...We must abide by modern laws."</p>

    <p>"Heh. Last time you smashed the door with a meteorite. You said it was force majeure."</p>

    <p>"eh...Because of this incident, I was deducted a few points. So I have to be careful now and don't cause unnecessary trouble."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I will listen to you." Zhang Zhui spread his hands helplessly.</p>

    <p>I was about to enter the apartment when I was suddenly stopped by the security guard at the door.</p>

    <p>"You two, what do you do?" The old security guard had never seen the faces of these two people. He felt that the eyes of Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were sneaky.</p>

    <p>"We..." In this regard, Li Xian admits that he has little experience.</p>

    <p>He has traveled to many places, but rarely sneaks into a girl's boudoir... Last time, he accidentally showed up at Old God's house. That can't be said to be sneaking in. It's just that Old God invited him to go.</p>

    <p>However, the guilty-minded Old God hid him.</p>

    <p>In the end, it turned into a big oolong and misunderstanding. So Li Xian was actually a little resistant to going to a girl's boudoir. Not only was she resistant... but she also had a bit of a psychological shadow.</p>

    <p>In this regard, Zhang Zhui's experience is much richer in comparison.</p>

    <p>In order to understand modern thieves' methods, he just finished the "Detective Conan" series not long ago. He mainly watched the part about Kaitou Kidd.</p>

    <p>Naturally, we also know the importance of disguise.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui naturally took out his ID from his pocket.</p>

    <p>This is the temporary consultant certificate given to him by Kong Feng, the leader of the anti-pocketeering team. It also has the official seal of the police station on it.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui laughed: "Uncle, we are the consultants of the anti-pocketing team. We mainly come to your community to visit and see if there are any loopholes. We will come out soon."</p>

    <p>The old man looked at Zhang Zhui with a sinister look on his face. He didn't think he was a good person.</p>

    <p>He took a photo with his ID. It seemed that he sent it to a friend who was more knowledgeable about this. After confirming that it was correct, he opened the gate: "Then you can go in. Thank you for your hard work, comrades."</p>

    <p>Finally passed the first level successfully.</p>

    <p>Li Xian secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>After all, it was Zhang Zhui. His experience as an eternal thief and his big heart and reflexes cultivated through long-term work in this field finally helped him.</p>

    <p>Next is the most exciting part.</p>

    <p>Pick the lock.</p>

    <p>In the modern world of cultivation, the door lock cylinder of a cultivator is also very special. You need to insert the key and recite the mantra silently in your heart to open the restriction in the lock cylinder. Otherwise, an alarm will sound immediately.</p>

    <p>Before coming here, Zhang Zhui made a special effort to find out.</p>

    <p>It sounds like a very advanced method, but in Zhang Zhui's opinion, it's actually just childish. It's just a leftover method from the ancient times. And it's a simplified version.</p>

    <p>When he was robbing tombs, he broke the locks of countless tombs. The restrictions were much stronger than they are now.</p>

    <p>One missed step will lead to death.</p>

    <p>After the two arrived at the door of Jiang Yingying's house, Li Xian's expression looked a little nervous.</p>

    <p>"Should I go to look for the wind? Brother Zi Xiang?"</p>

    <p>"No need. Just a lock. It will be over soon."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled: "Speaking of which, this ability to pick locks was passed down to me by a teacher."</p>

    <p>"Isn't it your special skill as a thief to slip in and pick locks?"</p>

    <p>"I think I'm strong. But that person is stronger than me." Zhang Zhui said with a smile: "In the beginning, I could pick the lock with just a knitting yarn. But that person used his mind to pick the lock."</p>

    <p>"He's a strange person." Li Xian nodded and asked, "Who is this person? Do I know him?"</p>

    <p>There are only a few famous people in the Eternal Period. His experience is also very vast. I feel that if I know Zhang Zhang, I might be able to recognize him.</p>

    <p>Communication between people of the same level is sometimes so simple and unpretentious.</p>

    <p>Just like WeChat Moments.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you will find that one of your friends is actually giving likes to another friend. Only then do you realize that these two people actually know each other...</p>

    <p>"I don't know if you've heard of it."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "His surname is Xiang. His name is Xiang Yi."</p>
