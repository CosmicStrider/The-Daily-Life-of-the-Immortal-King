  <h1>Chapter 1591 The Outer God Pig Factory</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As far as Zhang Zhui's level of knowledge is concerned, he knows very well what kind of place this Outer God Palace is.</p>

    <p>As early as before he joined Corpse Map, he had heard people say that Dao Ancestor Wang had sent his true identity to explore this mysterious ancient universe palace.</p>

    <p>Then... not a single clone came back.</p>

    <p>Since then, Zhang Zhui began to investigate all the information about the palace.</p>

    <p>Only later did I gradually understand that this was the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>At first, he did have the idea of breaking in. Mainly because he thought there might be something valuable in the ancient universe palace. He could go in and make a fortune.</p>

    <p>He even deliberately released many fake secret realm maps to lure some ancient powerful men to explore the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>As a result, no one came out...</p>

    <p>Since then, Zhang Zhui has completely given up the idea of going to the Outer God Palace to work as a porter.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling is standing in the palace of the Outer Gods without any trace of panic. This surprised Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Judging from the basic speed attributes and mental attributes that have been revealed so far, the boy is both "﹢∞."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Zhang Zhui thinks this is a bit outrageous...</p>

    <p>"What a troublesome boy..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed silently in his heart. Then he opened his mouth and said: "I can only tell you. What I know. I have heard many things about the Palace of Outer Gods. I have never seen it with my own eyes."</p>

    <p>He crossed his arms and deliberately put on an old-fashioned look: "Although you have not completed the task I assigned as a condition for exchanging information... But this situation is a forced cooperation. I have to help you. After all, if you die here, my wish to find my descendants will be in vain."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling. This old man is quite arrogant.</p>

    <p>But in a sense, he thinks Zhang Zhui is still a very interesting person.</p>

    <p>After using King's Eyes. Wang Ling to transmit all the battle scenes. Zhang Zhui was particularly concerned about the name the eyeball said before dying.</p>

    <p>"Sotos..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui frowned and said, "It seems that the one outside inherited the bloodline of this outside god."</p>

    <p>"Eeyah?" Wang Nuan asked.</p>

    <p>He was speaking baby talk, but amazingly, Zhang Zhui actually understood it.</p>

    <p>I saw Zhang Zhui nodded and said: "It is indeed very strong. This alien god ranked second in the ranking of alien gods that year. It is said to be omniscient and omniscient. It knows everything. It can connect time and space. And it is not affected by it. Bound by time and space."</p>

    <p>"Eeyah Eeyah?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. All the information I know is from Dao Ancestor Wang's notes. Although Dao Ancestor's real clone did not come out of the Outer God's Palace, the investigation of the Outer God's Palace played a role. I'm afraid it was before his death. Passed the information on."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "You have to be careful, kid... This Sotos is the second Outer God after all. He is a difficult one to deal with. This Outer God Palace is his hinterland. In order to gain great power, he even does not hesitate to enslave his own. Same race. The eyeball just now is the best example."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He can actually feel it.</p>

    <p>This palace of the outer gods is actually a huge "pig farm."</p>

    <p>And this foreign god named Sotos is probably an old factory worker.</p>

    <p>Use your own palace of foreign gods to enslave some Old Dominators here. Then continuously absorb energy from the outside. Let these enslaved Old Dominators devour these foreign creatures.</p>

    <p>Until the day of fattening.</p>

    <p>These enslaved rulers will eventually fall into the mouth of the abyss.</p>

    <p>And this... is what Dao Ancestor Wang mentioned in his notes. The Outer God's Pig Raising Plan...</p>

    <p>The ancient universe era is essentially the same as before the modern civilization of human cultivators was formally established. It is an era of disorder.</p>

    <p>What is emphasized is the old law of "the weak and the strong."</p>

    <p>The major alien gods each occupied a corner of the universe and then competed with each other.</p>

    <p>"It's really cruel."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. His face was expressionless.</p>

    <p>However, he came to the Palace of the Outer Gods this time not to give free feed to the Old Dominators here, but to get the three-petal Golden Lotus hidden in the palace.</p>

    <p>He asked Zhang Zhui. As a result, Zhang Zhui touched his chin and thought hard for a while. He didn't have the slightest clue: "Are you talking about the three-petal Golden Lotus? Hmm... That seems to be something from the ancient universe. I'm here I saw it in the notes of Dao Ancestor Wang. Unfortunately, the records of Golden Lotus at that time were very limited. There are no more clues."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui once broke into Dao Ancestor Wang's residence several times in order to search for his "treasure."</p>

    <p>Apart from stealing the heart of the "Old God", Zhang Zhui feels that the most valuable thing in his hand now is the notes about Dao Ancestor Wang that he saw after breaking in several times.</p>

    <p>He didn't go there just to peep at the individuals in the notes.</p>

    <p>Because Dao Ancestor Wang's notes usually contain the coordinates of newly generated secret realms in the universe. For cultivators who are eager to seek the immortal element, these secret realms of the universe are heavenly paradises that can quickly improve their realm.</p>

    <p>Therefore, what Zhang Zhui really wants to get is actually the coordinate information of these secret realms in the universe.</p>

    <p>Then as long as he draws a treasure map and sells it, it will be enough to keep him out of trouble and live a richer life than most Eternal level cultivators.</p>

    <p>These are the things that Wang Ling just heard Zhang Zhui mention now.</p>

    <p>He didn't know that Zhang Zhui had such a past.</p>

    <p>What Zhang Zhui didn't expect was that he never said anything. Wang Ling didn't even forcefully search his memory.</p>

    <p>Just ask a young man who doesn't even pay attention to the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>If you really want to forcibly retrieve your own memory, isn't it something that can be easily accomplished?</p>

    <p>But the boy in front of me didn't do that...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui believes that he has lived for eternity. He has seen too many so-called strong men who stand at the top and dominate the world and look at others with their noses.</p>

    <p>They're so high and mighty. All they do is act like they're dead moms.</p>

    <p>But since Zhang Zhui got to know Wang Ling, he suddenly discovered that the elegance of those eternal powerful men he knew in the past was really not one ten thousandth of that of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Are the truly strong men all gentle people..." Zhang Zhui smiled bitterly in his heart at this time.</p>

    <p>He had to admit that he had a good impression of Wang Ling in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although the boy didn't seem to do anything to him.</p>

    <p>In modern terms. The boy in front of me. He's an old man.</p>

    <p>"Keep moving forward. If I know something, I will tell you everything." At this time, Zhang Zhui said. He closed his eyes again, with a fearless attitude.</p>

    <p>The new owner wrapped in Corpse Map in front of him gave him a great sense of security.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Zhang Zhui is already a dead man.</p>

    <p>This line of work is nothing more than risking your life to accompany a gentleman...</p>

    <p>If he died, it wouldn't be a loss.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling can walk out of the palace of the outer gods alive, then he will be a witness to history. At the same time, he can brag about this matter to others for a lifetime!</p>

    <p>--I walked away from the palace of the outer gods. And I came out alive!</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling is selecting the next entrance.</p>

    <p>There was a piece of purple feathers condensing in the sky. Then it fell down. It slowly stayed in the palm of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is the reward for completing the second level [Chaos Divine Feather]</p>

    <p>What surprised Wang Ling slightly.</p>

    <p>This time, the reward is not a one-time item.</p>

    <p>But a permanent chaos device!</p>

    <p>It is the same existence as the Supreme Corpse Map!</p>

    <p>Moreover, the chaos concentration of this Chaos Divine Feather... is actually several times higher than that of the Corpse Map!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this should be regarded as free material.</p>

    <p>He accepted it with satisfaction. He planned to go back and study it later to use it as a strengthening material for "Jingke."</p>

    <p>Chaos Divine Feather: "?"</p>
