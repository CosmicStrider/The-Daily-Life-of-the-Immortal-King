  <h1>Chapter 2175 Battle for Wang Muyu</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu was stunned by this question.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Muyu didn't quite understand why Wang Ling chose Yi Jianchuan to be his master at the beginning.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of a human monk, the Huaxiu Sword Master is indeed extremely famous. He is the leading swordsman expert. He is also the only designated successor to the famous Sword Immortal Van Rui.</p>

    <p>How many people wanted to beg him to be a teacher, but they were all rejected because of lack of talent.</p>

    <p>But as a dragon descendant, although Wang Muyu is young, he is an all-purpose colorful little dragon that combines the genes of hundreds of families. From the beginning of his birth, his realm and combat power far exceed that of ordinary humans. If we only talk about combat power, of course Yi Jianchuan It's not as good as one's own.</p>

    <p>But with in-depth contact, Wang Muyu gradually discovered the shining points in his teacher.</p>

    <p>Following the Huaxiu Sword Master, Wang Muyu felt that he could become calmer. He finally understood what he had been missing all along.</p>

    <p>That's the state of mind.</p>

    <p>"No. Follow the teacher. I also learned a lot."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu said seriously. His eyes released a little starlight. It seemed that he was in a sea of stars.</p>

    <p>"Really? That's really great." Yi Jianchuan couldn't help but tugged Wang Muyu's face. He sighed that the little guy was too soft and cute. But he still felt that Wang Muyu's face seemed familiar. It seemed like he had seen it somewhere. It seems like a good thing.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Yi Jianchuan was thinking a lot. Then suddenly he seemed to remember something. His eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>By the way...</p>

    <p>It was the military training exercise of the Sixth School at that time...</p>

    <p>A battle royale-style military training jointly organized by six high schools. Various artifacts and magic weapons are arranged in the scene to test the students' ability to adapt to changes. He came up with this planning proposal at the time. Therefore, Yi Jianchuan himself was particularly interested in this military training. Very impressive.</p>

    <p>Now, he was almost sure that he had seen Wang Muyu's face before. And he had seen it during the military training exercise of the Sixth School!</p>

    <p>But which high school student he was from specifically? Yi Jianchuan really couldn't remember...</p>

    <p>Six colleges and universities. More than 10,000 people...</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan had a headache and rubbed his brain.</p>

    <p>Now is not the time to dwell on these things.</p>

    <p>He brought Wang Muyu here because he wanted to be honest with each other and make things clear so that there would be no resentment between master and disciple.</p>

    <p>Now. The purpose has been achieved.</p>

    <p>"Master will definitely protect your Muyu. I will not let your existence be known to people who don't want to do it." Yi Jianchuan stroked Wang Muyu's head.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a fierce murderous aura came across from the distant sky.</p>

    <p>A very powerful aura. It directly sent chills down the Huaxiu Sword Master's spine. He felt a sense of oppression that was crushing his soul.</p>

    <p>It can make him feel frightened even in the holy realm. Yi Jianchuan almost dared to assert that this is definitely not the spiritual pressure that human monks at this stage can form.</p>

    <p>"Teacher... he is here with bad intentions. This is no enemy you can stop." Wang Muyu stretched out his little arm to protect Yi Jianchuan behind him.</p>

    <p>"Is another real dragon coming?" Yi Jianchuan thought of something almost immediately when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A passage appeared in the void. Yi Jianchuan looked away. He saw a dragonborn with a body made of mercury walking out of the passage with arms folded. He opened the dragonborn's arms and looked down at him with domineering eyes.</p>

    <p>This sense of oppression is too strong. It's like the arrival of the Supreme Being from the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. It makes people's breathing become solemn.</p>

    <p>On the hills surrounding Yashe, countless flowers, plants and trees withered with this biting murderous aura and huge amounts of spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Until now, Yi Jianchuan finally understood why energy fluctuations that far exceeded the current level of the earth were frequently occurring in the restricted sea area on the earth.</p>

    <p>This dragonborn was just standing in the void. The murderous aura accumulated on his body seemed to have gathered into a bloody waterfall, pouring down from top to bottom, flooding the nearby mountains, and finally forming a sea of blood.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu pushed Yi Jianchuan. Yi Jianchuan rubbed his eyes. Only to see that the sea of blood suddenly disappeared.</p>

    <p>He almost fell into an illusion!</p>

    <p>"Teacher, you have to be careful." Wang Muyu looked into the void with great caution.</p>

    <p>"Do you know this Dragonborn?"</p>

    <p>"I know. And it's just a clone." Wang Muyu didn't expect that Qiao Yanyuan would actually become stronger again. This rate of improvement is terrifying. This is just a clone, which can bring such oppression.</p>

    <p>Above the nine heavens, Qiao Yanyuan's avatar was holding his arms, arrogant, looking down at the two masters and apprentices below.</p>

    <p>"Shame!"</p>

    <p>That body said angrily: "As the supreme true dragon incarnation, you actually recognize a human being as your teacher. Don't you have the slightest bit of shame?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu put on his posture. His eyes were firm: "You are the shame. I am still a child. You know how to bully me based on my age. If you have the ability, let me grow up for a few more years! But even now, you may not be able to beat me if you are alone. Pass me."</p>

    <p>"You can beat it but you can't beat it. You will know once you try it."</p>

    <p>The clone snorted and said: "I have been given the title by the Dragon Lord. Purple Sun Dragon Lord. I have reached a higher level! Even if I am just a clone, I can easily defeat you! Although you have the advantage of talent, you lack experience after all. What do you think? Do you come with me? Or do I kill your teacher, cripple you, and take you away by force."</p>

    <p>When he heard this body brazenly saying that he wanted to kill his teacher, Wang Muyu's expression immediately turned cold. Although he knew that Bai Zhe now relied on his own ability to do whatever he wanted and was still cultivating his capable generals. But so This is the first time I've seen him so arrogant.</p>

    <p>It's just a separate body!</p>

    <p>Dare to show off your power here!</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu formed a seal with his hands. The nearby scene changed instantly. Mountains of seven colors appeared. Even the sky was filled with dreamy glass-like clouds and mist. It was as if people were in a fairy tale world.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Muyu's core world. Everything is dream-like, giving people a sense of unreality.</p>

    <p>He is still a child after all...</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan sighed.</p>

    <p>He felt that the little guy was very pure. He was inexplicably moved.</p>

    <p>"Children are children. Reality is cruel. It's not like a fairy tale world like yours." The body snorted. He was clearly in someone else's core world, but he didn't notice all this at all. Put yourself in a very high position.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu snapped his fingers in front of him. The dream-like sky was filled with thunder and lightning for an instant, drowning the entire fairy tale-like clouds. Endless thunder exploded from the void, carrying the power of chaos and coming from above. Pour into the ground.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan immediately frowned.</p>

    <p>The dragonborn in this body was even weirder than he imagined. This was the first time he saw someone who could move freely and show off his power in someone else's core world without gaining world permission.</p>
