  <h1>Chapter 1724 Father Recognition Conference</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming and Shou Chong didn't expect that the slap in the face would come so unexpectedly. These rotten inventions floating in the abandoned sea actually have the ability to recognize their owners by voice. This was something neither of them expected.</p>

    <p>Finally, with a shrill "Dad--" coming from the baby's mouth and the fading final sound, Shou Chong threw the baby back into the sea with a face twitching.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was silent for a moment. He thought this might be the legendary "father is kind and son is filial."</p>

    <p>In fact, as Wang Ming said, on the road of research, development and exploration of cultivation science, scientists will more or less come up with some useless inventions that are incomprehensible. But like Shou Chong, they are all useless...Wang Ming feels that it will indeed last a long time.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming clearly knows how many useless gadgets he invented in the past because of his playfulness.</p>

    <p>Probably no less than 200?</p>

    <p>These are all small things that he made for fun in his spare time. But now there are far more than 200 floating on this sea of waste. At least there are hundreds of thousands of them...</p>

    <p>Originally, in order to comfort Shou Chong, Wang Ming also wanted to find a gadget he invented back then to provide Shou Chong with some psychological balance.</p>

    <p>As a result, he threw down a fishing net. When he pulled it up, they were all Shou Chong's "sons."</p>

    <p>"Shou Chong. Are you short of money?" Wang Ming asked, stunned.</p>

    <p>He thought about it carefully. Shou Chong could have so many useless inventions. In fact, they were all for the sake of two words: Qia fan<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("恰飯" Chinese internet buzzword refering to a series of actions taken in order to make a living.)</dfn>

    <p>There are actually many private cultivation scientists like Shou Chong who rely on inventing some IQ tax products to obtain research funds. It's just that Shou Chong is a relatively successful representative.</p>

    <p>"I recorded short videos for each of my inventions. I just didn't expect that the short video of making the Brainwave Spirit Sword Controller was accidentally posted online by my assistant. Then it caused a sensation on Station B."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong smiled bitterly and said: "You know, I am now a video UP host. I have a creative incentive plan. Traffic is settled in separate accounts. I can occasionally receive advertisements from game companies. It is indeed very profitable. I was even invited by Station B before. I went to some award ceremony for the top 100 UP masters. To put it bluntly, it was all for research funding. So I just gave it up."</p>

    <p>"So. What are you studying?" Wang Ming was curious.</p>

    <p>If it is just an ordinary research project, it should not require so much funding. Because as far as he knows, the research funding Shou Chong received from Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong alone was more than 20 billion.</p>

    <p>Investing such a large amount of money in research. One can imagine the confidentiality and complexity of the research behind it.</p>

    <p>"I... don't want to talk about it yet."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong coughed and said: "But I did encounter some obstacles. If I can really get out of trouble later, maybe I will invite you to participate in the research of this project."</p>

    <p>"What is it about? Can you tell me a little bit about it?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"New energy development." Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. It's a promising research project." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>From this point of view, he felt that the direction of Shou Chong's research was actually similar to his research on the new seal Talisman for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As we all know, Wang Ling's spiritual energy is increasing day by day. And it has always maintained an extremely high spiritual energy fluctuation. So in theory, you only need to find someone who can give Wang Ling unlimited spiritual energy. Exports can achieve a relatively balanced state.</p>

    <p>However, it is definitely not possible to release the spiritual energy in Wang Ling's body at will. If it is not controlled properly, it will cause secondary damage to the earth's environment and even the universe's environment. The method currently thought of by Wang Ming is actually the same as " The legend of "Dayu's control of floods" has different approaches but the same effect.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, it is better to clear things up than to block them.</p>

    <p>But in fact, if "blocking" and "draining" are done at the same time, it may achieve better results.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ming's current idea is to seal part of Wang Ling's spiritual energy and guide the other part of Wang Ling's spiritual energy to flow out of the body.</p>

    <p>And the spiritual energy flowing out can be used. Maybe it can also make some contribution to the development of environmental protection. This is what Wang Ming has in mind. An ideal development model for the new version of sealed Talisman.</p>

    <p>If it can succeed.</p>

    <p>He feels that "eternity" can be achieved!</p>

    <p>So in a sense, Shou Chong's secret research seems to be very suitable for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>In the future, maybe the two of them will have a chance to collaborate in a grand way.</p>

    <p>But right now, Wang Ming just wants to get out as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>He stopped asking Shou Chong more about his research experiments because he also knew that issues in this area were relatively sensitive. Asking too many questions might affect the tacit understanding of teamwork between them.</p>

    <p>"Finally found it."</p>

    <p>After sailing on the abandoned sea for a long time, Wang Ming fished up many sons invented by Shou Chong. Until this moment, he finally found what he wanted.</p>

    <p>It was a third-generation humanoid mecha based on Wang Ling. It was also called Wang Ling Number 2.9.1.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was immediately stunned because he felt as if he had seen this humanoid mecha somewhere.</p>

    <p>"This is my brother." Wang Ming said: "Since you were swallowed by Master Wu Xin, your minds will also be temporarily fused. You may have seen some scenes of my brother fighting this Master Wu Xin."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Shou Chong suddenly realized; "I have been wandering on this ghost ship for a long time. I have indeed seen a similar young man in my hazy dreams. It turns out that was the scene when Master Wu Xin was fighting with your brother..."</p>

    <p>"They are also very close to each other."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled: "Wu Xin never expected that you and I would be so strong-willed. We did not completely synchronize into his mental space because of his invasion. We even planned to secretly organize a vigorous war in this abandoned sea. Counterattack plan. If we regain sovereignty later, we can retrieve the memory of Master Wu Xin and see what he wants to do."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. This might be a surprise."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong nodded and said.</p>

    <p>But soon his mind suddenly turned around: "--Wait a minute! You said the young man fighting Master Wu Xin is your brother? Master Wu Xin is an Eternal One! How old are you... and your brother..."</p>

    <p>"Ahem... these are not the point. Let's cooperate first. Regarding my brother, I will find an opportunity to explain it to you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. Then he stared at the third-generation humanoid mecha in front of him: "As you can see, this third-generation humanoid mecha is version 2.9.1. However, because the fluidity and maneuverability tests failed, it did not meet the preset standards. So it is considered A failure. But not at all totally unusable."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong knelt down and stroked the smooth metal lines of the mecha. He nodded slightly thoughtfully: "Even if it works, the scale still looks a bit too small. I'm afraid it won't sink your giant aircraft carrier." easy."</p>

    <p>"So my idea is to remove the core of the third generation humanoid mecha."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Then, gather the strength of the two of us and reassemble a bigger one!"</p>

    <p>"Do you think you are assembling a Gundam?" Shou Chong sweated: "And such large parts. Even if we can make them, it will be very difficult to assemble them."</p>

    <p>"That's not necessarily true. 2.9.1 is not completely unusable. As long as you put on this suit, you will have the power of the giant parts assembled."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ming had already pressed the button on 2.9.1. He saw 2.9.1 automatically disassembled and slowly attached to Wang Ming's body like fish scales. Then he shouted to the sea: "Son Grandson! Where are you?"</p>

    <p>The words just fell!</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound...</p>

    <p>Two flashes of light suddenly appeared on the distant sea.</p>

    <p>Two more humanoid mechas turned into meteors and appeared at the feet of Wang Ming and Shou Chong from a distance.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was shocked: "This is..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "These are 2.9.2 and 2.9.3. Theoretically, they are indeed the sons and grandsons of 2.9.1. You should put on these sons first."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Shou Chong feels that Wang Ming is taking advantage of him.</p>
