  <h1>Chapter 1909 100 Million Times Heart Sword</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Heart Sword's "No Trace". This is the supreme secret method in Sword. It cannot be used by those who are not Sword practitioners.</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, this is a technique that softens one's own mental power into reality, thereby converting invisible psychic energy into sharp sword intent. It is an attack at the level of mental flow and consciousness flow. However, it can affect reality.</p>

    <p>In other words, if you are stabbed by the Heart Sword, you will not only be attacked at the mental level, but also suffer an equal amount of physical damage.</p>

    <p>In the old world, the mental power of the outer gods was mostly extraordinary. Extraordinary cultivators could fight against them. However, defeating the opponent from the area they were most familiar with was always what Wang Ling was most willing to try.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling doesn't believe that he is really invincible. He thinks that he cannot be a true hexagon warrior. There must be something that is his weakness...</p>

    <p>In many battles in the past, Wang Ling has experienced countless physical and magical confrontations.</p>

    <p>What a pity. He never lost once.</p>

    <p>So this time, he faced another new challenge.</p>

    <p>The Outer Gods are all old bosses in the spiritual series. Although he had the experience of defeating Fenmu Shen last time, Fenmu Shen actually did not completely inherit Sotos's outer Heavenly Dao tradition.</p>

    <p>This time Peng Beicen was plotted by Peng Xiren and swallowed the insect cyst. Even though it is not yet clear what the outer god's orthodoxy is.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has felt the mental power that he unleashed wantonly. Peng Beicen is stronger than Fenmu Shen back then. At least in terms of mental power, Peng Beicen has an absolute advantage.</p>

    <p>The Sotos tradition inherited by Fenmu Shen. Although the spiritual power is equally powerful, the opponent's strength lies in the control of time and space.</p>

    <p>In terms of mental strength alone, Peng Beicen's growth is even more amazing than Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling's first wave of tentative Heart Sword failed under the powerful mental fluctuations, his second wave of Heart Sword with a power of 100 million times was rapidly generated around him, directly turning into a Lotus Sword Circle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Peng Beicen, who was getting more and more swollen. Without any hesitation. Wherever his lazy eyes pointed, the 100 million times Heart Sword suddenly shot out.</p>

    <p>In the void ahead, deep runes from the old world appeared. They lit up at the same moment. Those were the outer spiritual barriers that previously blocked Wang Ling's first wave of Heart Sword attacks.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>This time, with 100 million times the power of the Heart Sword, all these old runes were destroyed effortlessly. They were completely shattered in an instant.</p>

    <p>The Peng family's headquarters was shaken. The violent fluctuations centered on the battle site between the two spread out in all directions, destroying dozens of palaces.</p>

    <p>The chief manager of the Peng family was dumbfounded. The buildings of his Peng family's headquarters were all made of high-quality materials. Even Dao God's spell impact could be resisted. He never thought that it would be as crispy as tofu curd.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the outer god's spiritual barrier collapsed, Peng Beicen let out a painful roar at the same time. The gradually expanding old bloodline in her body showed an unyielding attitude. The old world creatures have always regarded human cultivators as inferior creatures. Wang Ling's resistance completely activated the contempt and anger flowing in its bloodline.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen's power surged again. This time he directly reached the astonishing sixth level of Heavenly Ancestor. He also directly raised to the third level of small realm. It made Wang Ling feel incredible.</p>

    <p>Her body became more swollen than before. It was no longer as slender as a branch. From a skinny dark witch, it turned into a huge mass of flesh floating in the void like a mountain.</p>

    <p>There are tentacles all over the bottom of the meat piece. Mucus with terrifying energy density drips down along the tentacles. At the top of the meat piece. Wang Ling can clearly see Peng Beicen's face roaring in pain.</p>

    <p>"Shayani Gusi..." At this time, Emperor Dongda suddenly spoke.</p>

    <p>As the Great Emperor, he has been wary of the resurgence of the old power. Therefore, he has been doing a lot of personal research on the ancient world. At first, he could not see what kind of power from the outside gods Peng Beicen inherited. Now he sees this and Legend has it that a similar body of an alien god was described in ancient books. A name instantly blurted out from his mouth.</p>

    <p>That is the terrifying existence known as the "Dark Mother Goddess" among the Outer Gods. It possesses the supreme spiritual control ability. It even has the ability and life recovery power to breed endless Old Dominators.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Emperor Dongda can be sure that Peng Beicen will never explode because she inherited the bloodline of Sayani Gusi. This is because Peng Beicen has now entered the intermediate form, and the bloodline of Sayani Gusi has completely contaminated her.</p>

    <p>Relying on Sayani Gusi's powerful life recovery power, Peng Beicen's life will also be preserved.</p>

    <p>But it is obvious that Peng Beicen's current will has not been completely swallowed up. She is still desperately resisting this declining alien god bloodline.</p>

    <p>However, in such an extreme state, in order to relieve the pain of her body, her instinct was to release the power in her body.</p>

    <p>As a result, greater destruction and attack occurred.</p>

    <p>Just when the 100 Million Times Heart Sword broke through the outermost barrier and continued to rush forward. Wang Ling saw the tentacles hanging below the pieces of meat suddenly move. It plunged directly into the earth. Then it penetrated into the core of Penglai Star at an extremely fast speed.</p>

    <p>It is like countless straws piercing the planet at the same time. It wants to directly drain the energy of the planet. And once the energy of the planet is completely drained. The planet will directly disintegrate and become dust in the universe.</p>

    <p>It can be clearly seen that the plants that depend on Penglai Planet will wither and turn yellow in an instant. This withering, centered on the Peng family headquarters, will directly spread to every corner of Penglai Planet until this planet. The energy was completely drained.</p>

    <p>Under such energy extraction, the 100 million times Heart Sword failed to achieve the desired effect of Wang Ling. Although his Heart Sword continued to advance, Peng Beicen also continued to build barriers at the same time, weakening the Heart Sword. The power of the sword cannot make the 100 million times Heart Sword reach the core.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>However, two consecutive encounters with the wall did not change his expression at all. After all, it was only 100 million times. He was far from reaching his peak.</p>

    <p>He could see that Sayani Gusi had entered a defensive posture. This dark mother goddess among the outer gods was trying to drain the energy of the planet to achieve a higher-level bloodline form between herself and Peng Beicen.</p>

    <p>And by that time, it will be able to continuously produce terrifying Old Dominators with the power of the Dark Mother Goddess. By then, the recovery plan of the old world will be more than half successful!</p>

    <p>However, a scene that Sayani Gusi didn't expect happened soon.</p>

    <p>Because at this time, the human man standing in front of it slowly closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>The scene first entered a period of deathly silence. Then the next moment, a horrifying scene happened.</p>

    <p>This time, the young man's sword was not aimed at the huge piece of meat that covered the sky. Instead, it went straight to the ground in the direction of the tentacles!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>With just one sword stroke, Penglai Star has been pierced!</p>

    <p>Sayani Gusi then Peng Beicen's body and mind began to feel a little dazed... It's unbelievable. A young human cultivator can actually do this.</p>

    <p>Then in the next second, an even more incredible scene happened before her.</p>

    <p>She saw Wang Ling bending down. Crouching at the hole that was drilled through. His advantageous arm penetrated along the hole and then extended indefinitely!</p>

    <p>That is the real hand of God. It grabs directly along the entrance of the cave to the depths.</p>

    <p>Then, he directly grabbed the tentacles that were absorbing the star core energy from Sayani Gusi...</p>
