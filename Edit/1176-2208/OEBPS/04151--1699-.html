  <h1>Chapter 1699 Consciousness Infection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Spatial positioning through teleportation. Lord Ma's mood at this time was extremely complicated and extremely nervous. As a man in love, he actually had a feeling...</p>

    <p>That is, the man next to me said he wanted to save crispy noodles. He showed a very "role model" side. But in fact, what he really wanted to save was Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It's just because of my personality. I didn't say it out loud.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if his intuition was accurate. But rescuing Sun Rong has suddenly become his top priority right now. And it's obvious. He can only succeed... he can't fail.</p>

    <p>If he couldn't be rescued, he felt that his body might get cold.</p>

    <p>As the only one who has seen the asses of the Wang family's members, the only one who has been used in turn by the Wang family's members, the strongest among the spirits, and the only one who is in love with the Ushiki tree, Lord Ma is for the first time transmitting to a specific person with the seriousness of a surgery being performed.</p>

    <p>The next second, with a flash of light, beside Wang Ling, Lord Ma, who was covered in cold sweat, disappeared in an instant. Instead, there was a soft body covered with Talisman.</p>

    <p>Because I stayed in the humanoid gift box for too long. Secondly, I was a little nervous after hearing a few people talking outside. As a result, Sun Rong felt a little hypoxic inside.</p>

    <p>Now that she was rescued by Lord Ma, her feet immediately weakened. She originally fell towards Zhuo Yi, but Zhuo Yi had no intention of supporting her at all.</p>

    <p>Instead, he secretly used a gravitational technique to turn the direction of Sun Rong, who immediately fell on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The two of them looked at each other in disbelief, but only Sun Rong's face burned for a moment, and she hastily let go of his hand.</p>

    <p>At this time Zhuo Yi walked over and showed a natural expression as if nothing had happened: "That's great. Miss Rong is fine. But this matter. It seems that it has not been resolved yet."</p>

    <p>Lord Ma saved Sun Rong that's right.</p>

    <p>But in fact this cannot be said to be salvation.</p>

    <p>Because Lord Ma took advantage of the gift box not paying attention and replaced herself in it.</p>

    <p>It ensures that there is always a person lying in the human-shaped gift box. This prevents the gift box from exploding.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is also the best way for Lord Ma after comprehensive consideration. It can ensure the rescue of Sun Rong and transfer the risk to himself.</p>

    <p>He is just a toilet. Even if the gift box explodes in the end, he will not feel any pain.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fully affirms Lord Ma's performance.</p>

    <p>Enlighten the spirits. Their souls are given by Wang Ling. They are different from ordinary human cultivators.</p>

    <p>So Lord Ma used the civet cat to replace the prince, and replaced himself. The rest will be easy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying cooperates well.</p>

    <p>He had been watching for a long time. He also knew what Wang Ling was thinking at this time. He immediately took this human-shaped gift box and shrunk into an inch, away from the earth, and to other corners of the universe.</p>

    <p>This is where Wang Ying often plays Planet thumping technique with Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how many planet spirits have been harmed by him.</p>

    <p>So it is most appropriate to choose this place to detonate.</p>

    <p>Anyway, he will repair these planet spirits later on.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Just a few seconds later, a huge explosion came from the depths of the universe.</p>

    <p>A huge mushroom cloud rose out of thin air and stretched for several light-years along with the powerful explosive ring. It blew everything around it apart.</p>

    <p>This alarm could not be heard by cultivators below the level of Dao God.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling moved his ears. He looked towards a certain direction in the void. Follow his line of sight. That was the location of the explosion.</p>

    <p>The scale of the explosion was greater than Wang Ling's actual estimates.</p>

    <p>Because at the same time as the explosion, the spirit of the planet was also detonated, resulting in a series of explosions, like a falling domino, which suddenly increased the scope and power of the explosion to a stronger level.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine what kind of destructive force it would cause if something like this happened on Earth. I'm afraid the entire solar system would disappear.</p>

    <p>And those who can arrange such means are definitely not ordinary people.</p>

    <p>Later, Wang Ying returned with Lord Ma, who was instantly repaired. Lord Ma became a personal experiencer of the explosion. Although he was the oldest person among the spirits, the condition on his face was obviously not good.</p>

    <p>He shuddered slowly. He was still a little frightened. He had never experienced an explosion of this scale.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the special nature of the enlightened spirit, I'm afraid it would have been difficult to survive.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Ma. What happened?" Zhuo Yi imitated the tone of a recently popular ghost video. As a result, Wang Ling rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Master, don't blame me... I just want to liven up the atmosphere..." Zhuo Yi smiled awkwardly.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Lord Ma. It's all because of me..." Sun Rong blamed herself.</p>

    <p>"This matter has nothing to do with Miss Rong. Even if the gift box was lying on someone else's side, the other party would have done the same thing. It's just that Miss Rong happened to be taken advantage of."</p>

    <p>Lord Ma thought for a moment and said: "Moreover, such a method is not something ordinary people can do. The master took leave today and specially built fortifications at home. The purpose is to prepare for rainy days and resist foreign enemies. He never thought that these people would take action. Come on. It's so quick."</p>

    <p>"Who?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Those I have dealt with before are at least cosmic-level figures." Lord Ma replied.</p>

    <p>"But haven't those people already been ... by Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"Since he is a cosmic figure, he always has a way to resurrect himself. It is not so easy to completely eliminate him. Even if he only leaves a grain of ashes, it may become the key to the recovery of these people."</p>

    <p>"Then their strength must have been greatly reduced." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"That's true. But if these defeated people are twisted into a hemp rope and plan to deal with it together, it will still be a bit troublesome." Lord Ma sighed and said, "When you find a pile of people on the floor in the kitchen, Cockroaches crawling around. If you hit them with a palm, there will always be fish that slip through the net. But if it blows up the kitchen, I'm afraid it will affect yourself and even your neighbors."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this and nodded slightly. She knew that it was not easy to deal with such a matter, especially for Wang Ling. All aspects must be dealt with carefully.</p>

    <p>"Then what can I do to help you now?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple." At this time, Er Ha jumped on the table, looked at Sun Rong and said: "You just need to protect yourself. Judging from all the signs now, they have already targeted you. So in the end So we can upgrade the six-core Aohai."</p>

    <p>"Upgrade... to nine cores?" Sun Rong looked surprised.</p>

    <p>"Nine-core Aohai. With this combat power, it is enough." Lord Ma also nodded and said: "But in the explosion just now, I also noticed something strange."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Ma opened his mouth. A transparent light ball protruded from his mouth: "If the pupil power is not strong enough, it should be invisible. This thing was captured by me in the explosion. It seems to have the ability to control consciousness."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes suddenly froze.</p>

    <p>Because he saw a squirming transparent insect in this transparent light group, and it exuded a smell that belonged to the Old Dominator...</p>

    <p>"This matter is indeed related to Fenmu Shen."Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"The other party is very likely to have penetrated deeply into us." Lord Ma said: "This bug can control consciousness, so it can also silently infect human cultivators, judging from their level of understanding of our intelligence, right next to your master, I'm afraid that there are already important people who have been infected."</p>
