  <h1>Chapter 1645 Ha! This fool!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The shared version of King's Eyes has many abilities. But it also has permission restrictions. In fact, Zhuo Yi has not yet obtained permissions for many incredible abilities.</p>

    <p>It's not that Wang Ling is cheap. It's just that these powers, if misused or abused, could have a serious butterfly effect.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhuo Yi actually does not reach the level of psychic energy required to activate these heaven-defying abilities.</p>

    <p>He looked up and down at the young man in front of him. He felt as if he had heard this name somewhere before, but for a moment he couldn't place it.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi stared at Qin Zhong. Although he felt that the sudden appearance of Qin Zhong was a bit suspicious, he didn't know why. He felt that Qin Zhong seemed to be particularly kind.</p>

    <p>"How about it? Do you want to cooperate? It looks like you guys are planning to sell off these scraps, right?" Qin Zhong actually saw almost everything about the scene just now. He knew that Zhuo Yi had the ability to turn waste into treasure. Immediately proposed to join the cooperation.</p>

    <p>"Then let's see what you can do to help." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I'm just here to join in the fun. If I can help you, I hope you can help me think of a way to get me home." Qin Zhong replied.</p>

    <p>This was the first time Qin Zhong had encountered such a thing, falling into space turbulence and causing time and space to be disrupted. He could basically tell that he had fallen into another dimension.</p>

    <p>This is a big trouble.</p>

    <p>With his current level of strength, he still cannot achieve the ability to correct time and space.</p>

    <p>Of course. He doesn't know if Zhuo Yi can help him.</p>

    <p>But based on past experience.</p>

    <p>He felt that it was definitely right to follow Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>Because he is lucky enough.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would be impossible to just fall out of space. I heard Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi discussing plans in this deserted scrap recycling yard. And he found that he could just come in handy.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to cooperate? After all, we don't know you. I think we should consider it..." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>It's not that he is too repulsive to Qin Zhong. It's just that he is too unfamiliar with Qin Zhong. He doesn't know what the purpose of Qin Zhong's presence here is.</p>

    <p>And. If Qin Zhong is allowed to join... it might affect Zhou Ziyi's meritorious service.</p>

    <p>He was thinking about it. And then Qin Zhong crossed his arms. He laughed out loud: "I'm not a bad guy. If you are worried about me taking the credit, don't worry. If you're worried about me taking the credit, don't worry about it. I'm good at assisting. I'm good at that."</p>

    <p>This is not because Qin Zhong used some mind-reading ability. Instead, he made psychological guesses purely by analyzing the micro-expressions on Zhuo Yi's face. And then he got it right.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi pursed his lips and said: "It's not impossible for you to cooperate. But you must act according to my plan..."</p>

    <p>"Of course. I will listen to you." Qin Zhong nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then you and Ziyi can go pick up scraps together." Zhuo Yi ordered.</p>

    <p>Let a Dao God-level cultivator pick up garbage. This is something Zhuo Yi did not expect.</p>

    <p>He thought Qin Zhong would be angry. As a result, the other party seemed to be in an unusually good mood. It didn't look like he was picking up garbage at all. Instead, he felt like he was shopping for treasure.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked again.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I regretted just agreeing to join Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>Why does he always feel like he's crazy when he gets on board?</p>

    <p>Less than a quarter of an hour passed. Zhou Ziyi and Qin Zhong returned at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Master, the storage bag is basically full. They all look usable," Zhou Ziyi said. He basically picked out the stumps that looked new and didn't have much dust. A total of one was picked up. Hundreds of storage bags are filled. Full of results.</p>

    <p>After saying that, he looked at Qin Zhong: "So, brother Qin Zhong, how many did you pick up?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong took out a piece of gray stuff from his storage bag with a smile on his face. There was a stench of engine oil on it. It looked like lotus roots that had just been unearthed from the mud.</p>

    <p>"Oh, this... Can you sell it for money...?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi said doubtfully.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, on the other hand, is very confident in himself. The smile on his face does not diminish: "You will know after it is repaired."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About a while passed.</p>

    <p>The three of them brought the mechanical arm that had been repaired by Zhuo Yi using {Repair LightÂ·Household Appliances Edition} to a shop that sells and recycles mechanical limbs. Qin Zhong took a look at the name of the shop: Boss Ge's Mechanical Limb Shop. I suddenly had mixed feelings in my heart.</p>

    <p>As soon as I entered the shop, the fat shop owner was counting the money in the container. He seemed to be mumbling something.</p>

    <p>He stared at the account book and was puzzled. He looked distressed: "I just sold goods for 2,000 yuan. Why hasn't the cash in the cabinet changed? Is it because I haven't learned functions well? My math teacher is now in poor health. It's obviously pretty good..."</p>

    <p>"Boss, do you want to recycle the robotic arm?" Zhuo Yi asked at this moment.</p>

    <p>The fat shop owner immediately put down what he was doing and smiled again with a smile on his face: "What do you three want to sell?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi handed over Zhou Ziyi's bag first: "100 robot arms. The models and styles are all different. Boss, let's make a decision. I hope to offer a suitable price. If you're selling them as a package. It won't hurt to give them to the boss for a cheaper price."</p>

    <p>He had an old-fashioned look. He didn't feel guilty at all like an outsider.</p>

    <p>The fat boss was stunned for a moment. Then he turned around and poured the mechanical arm of the storage bag into the huge columnar machine at the rear.</p>

    <p>Buzz!--</p>

    <p>After the scanning red beam lasted for more than ten seconds, the 100 robotic arms were compiled into a long list and pulled out from the ticket spit below.</p>

    <p>"As expected. They are all old models."</p>

    <p>The fat boss sighed. He presented the list to Zhuo Yi and showed it: "Sir, look, my machine is connected to the Internet. 99% of all models of robotic arms are almost there. Just scan it and you'll have it."</p>

    <p>He talked nonstop.</p>

    <p>"Specific model, year of production, manufacturer, including price at the time of production and current market price."</p>

    <p>"Although your batch of robotic arms looks very new. It looks like it has never been used. However, it can only be slightly higher than the normal recycling price. 100 pieces. I will give you 5,000 silver gear coins at most."</p>

    <p>"This is only 5,000?" Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>It seems that the idea of making a fortune by repairing broken robotic arms is a bit unsuccessful.</p>

    <p>He probably knew that what the boss said was a bit exaggerated. But from a business perspective, there was nothing wrong with the boss being prudent.</p>

    <p>Normally it would be sold for more than 5,000.</p>

    <p>Maybe the boss quoted a little low. But Zhuo Yi speculated that the difference was only a few thousand yuan.</p>

    <p>Is he short of a few thousand yuan? He wants to become a wealthy person here by selling robotic arms! He has to earn 100 million first before he can do anything!</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi was too lazy to bargain. He directly agreed to sell this bag of robotic arms.</p>

    <p>The boss directly took out five 1,000-yuan banknotes from the cabinet and handed them to Zhuo Yi. There were silver gears painted on them and an exclusive anti-counterfeiting seal. Psychic fluctuations told Zhuo Yi .This is not a counterfeit note.</p>

    <p>Because the workmanship of counterfeit banknotes cannot be that complicated. Anti-counterfeiting seals are also deliberately arranged.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your patronage!"</p>

    <p>After accepting the robotic arm of the sack, the shop owner smiled from ear to ear.</p>

    <p>This time the price difference fluctuated. He had a net profit of about 3,000 silver gear coins.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhuo Yi said again: "Wait a minute. I still have a robotic arm here. I want to ask the boss to see how much it is worth."</p>

    <p>"There are more?" The store owner's eyes lit up: "How many more are there?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stretched out a finger and said with a smile: "1."</p>

    <p>This is the one that Qin Zhong found. He also repaired it just now.</p>

    <p>And when the robotic arm excavated by Qin Zhong was restored, Zhuo Yi was also a little surprised. Because it was a robotic arm made of bronze, and it looked very bulky.</p>

    <p>He doesn't understand the value of the robotic arm. He's just a layman. He doesn't believe Qin Zhong understands either.</p>

    <p>This bronze arm obviously doesn't look very valuable. But Qin Zhong has always been full of confidence from the beginning to now.</p>

    <p>"Boss. How much is it?" Qin Zhong's smile was still full of sunshine.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Zhuo Yi showed this bronze arm, the fat boss's eyes immediately changed.</p>

    <p>Different from the previous operation of pouring a storage bag of robotic arms into the cylindrical scanner, he took out a single-sided magnifying glass and a strong flashlight from his small drawer. He carefully inspected the entire bronze arm.</p>

    <p>After the whole store was quiet for several minutes.</p>

    <p>The fat boss suddenly exclaimed, "Bravo! Splended! This... How did this get here?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Why doesn't the boss put it into the machine for identification?"</p>

    <p>Fat Boss: "Bronze arms are rare. This is exactly what I said before. The backend library cannot scan 1% of the models."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "Is the workmanship very fine?"</p>

    <p>The fat boss shook his head and exclaimed: "No... it's not so much the workmanship, but its collection value!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, the fat boss suddenly realized that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He also wanted to pretend to be calm and deceive the bronze arm from Zhuo Yi at a cheap price.</p>

    <p>But after he saw this robotic arm, he couldn't hold back his excitement.</p>

    <p>"This one. If my vision is correct, it should be... a thousand years ago. The Bdwin-46 Royal Deluxe Limited Edition robotic arm produced by the CJG Robotic Arm Factory!"</p>

    <p>He said excitedly: "Look! This robotic arm! It's also engraved with the signatures of hundreds of wealthy gentry family patriarchs in the core area! It's carved in small characters! You need to use a magnifying glass to see it clearly! After a thousand years, I'm afraid this bronze The value of an arm is hard to estimate."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Brother Qin Zhong is so strong..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi were completely dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>God dug it and found a limited edition stick...</p>

    <p>"So, boss, you can't trade?" At this time, Qin Zhong took up the topic and asked.</p>

    <p>"Hey. To be honest, it's not that I don't want to buy it. It's this bronze arm. Except for the rich families in the core area, I'm afraid no store in the outer ring can accept it."</p>

    <p>The fat boss smiled helplessly and spread his hands: "We are just poor people. If it doesn't work, the three gentlemen can give it a try."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong held his chin up and thought briefly.</p>

    <p>If it is true, as the store owner said, that this bronze arm can only be recovered in the core area with the same amount of financial resources, then it is equivalent to being trapped in an infinite loop.</p>

    <p>The purpose of making money for the three of them is to sneak into the depths of the outer slums by buying legal identities through the power of money.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi were silent. Both of them tacitly wanted to see what Qin Zhong would choose.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qin Zhong raised his head again after thinking for a while.</p>

    <p>He showed a disappointed look. There was no trace of acting at all: "Hey. So, this baby is going to fall into my hands?"</p>

    <p>The fat boss smiled in his heart.</p>

    <p>He knew. It was his chance!</p>

    <p>"Actually, if you are willing to sell it, it's not that I can't buy it... But I have warned you, sir, in advance. Given the value of this treasure, it is not cost-effective to spend it on us. Our recycling price will definitely be far lower than Core area."</p>

    <p>"How much can be opened in the core area?"</p>

    <p>"They. I think they should give you at least 1 million."</p>

    <p>"One million silver gear coins?" Zhou Ziyi asked.</p>

    <p>"No. It's 1 million gold gear coins! Converted at 1:100. It's equivalent to 100 million silver gear coins!" said the fat boss.</p>

    <p>"Then how much can you give?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>"I... I can probably only give you 100,000 at most... and it's silver gear coins." The fat boss scratched his head and said.</p>

    <p>"The gap is indeed a bit big." Qin Zhong laughed: "Let's do this, boss. If you are willing to accept it, I can sell it to you. We are short of money recently."</p>

    <p>The fat boss was immediately stunned. He couldn't believe his ears: "What? You... are you willing to sell it to me?"</p>

    <p>"But you also know that these 100,000 silver gear coins must have been undersold. In addition to money, I think you should also give us some subsidies. What do you think?" Qin Zhong narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>The fat boss thought for a moment and said, "Well, let's do this. If you are willing to sell it, I will give you tickets to tonight's underground boxing match! I got reliable news tonight. The favorite, Jian Xiaoqiang, will face off against that master Niu Baoguo!" Master Niu Baoguo is bound to win! If the bet is successful, according to the odds, you can get 1 million silver gear coins at once!"</p>

    <p>"Must win?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled: "The boxing match hasn't started yet. It's just hearsay. I don't believe it."</p>

    <p>At this time, the fat boss gritted his teeth and decided to adopt a method that seemed a bit gambling, but was actually the most profitable method for him: "Then let's do this. I will give you 50 more lottery opportunities for free. You have also seen it." Although my shop is not big, it does have some top-notch goods. Whether you can get it or not depends on your luck."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he pressed the switch button on the counter and sealed the door of the store on the spot.</p>

    <p>Along with the sound of gears turning, the hidden mechanism display cabinet inside the store was displayed in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>This is his collection of robotic arms. There are hundreds of them in total.</p>

    <p>"These are the items I keep at the bottom of the box. Generally, they are not easily displayed to the outside world."</p>

    <p>He pointed to his hidden display cabinet and said: "The penultimate floor above is the SS area. Almost all of them have just been eliminated from the core area. However, the average selling price here is 100,000 silver gear coins."</p>

    <p>"The next grid is area S. The average selling price is 50,000 silver gear coins."</p>

    <p>"The average selling price in area A is 10,000 yuan. The rest are B products worth several thousand yuan and C products worth only a few hundred yuan."</p>

    <p>After the fat boss finished speaking, he turned around and carefully took out the bronze arm from the cabinet and placed it on the top of the display cabinet: "For so many years, I have been wondering if there are any SSR-level goods..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi: "..."</p>

    <p>"So what do you mean, boss?"</p>

    <p>"It's a lottery! All the robotic arms in my shop. As long as you are willing to sell me this bronze arm, I will let you draw! Including the one you sold me!"</p>

    <p>The fat boss said excitedly: "There are many small iron balls in the hand box over there! Black is C. Gray represents B. Silver is A. Gold is S. Purple gold represents SS... and the one representing SSR is jade. ball."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Qin Zhong nodded thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>"How about. In a word, do you dare to take a gamble with me? If this bronze arm is destined to you, you might be able to pull it back again."</p>

    <p>The fat boss continued to trick Qin Zhong into participating in this bet.</p>

    <p>He looked confident. He was almost sure that if Qin Zhong got the upper hand, he would definitely not be able to draw him.</p>

    <p>The store's lottery routine is always the same. The prizes are very attractive, but the probability is slim.</p>

    <p>There are one hundred thousand small balls in his hand box.</p>

    <p>Distributed according to proportion. Most of the balls are gray and black balls. The total number of silver balls representing A and gold balls representing S is only 100. The purple and gold balls of SS are 10.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most outrageous thing is the SSR jade ball that the shop owner just made on a whim.</p>

    <p>There is only 1 ball out of 100,000...</p>

    <p>While talking, he deliberately opened the hand-cranked box and showed the key jade ball to Qin Zhong, Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi. Then he added two more to the box. Put one in: "I'll add two more for you! Is that interesting?"</p>

    <p>"Excuse me boss... Is there no other alternative? Do we really have to do a lottery?" Qin Zhong asked repeatedly.</p>

    <p>"No more. We're poor. We can only bet on our luck."</p>

    <p>The fat boss laughed: "If you don't sell it, I'm going to find another store. It's probably a lottery for you too."</p>

    <p>"Ha. All right. I'll draw." Qin Zhong laughed.</p>

    <p>The fat boss was delighted: "You mean..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded: "Yes. I'm selling this bronze arm to you. But if I get something good, boss, please don't default on it."</p>

    <p>The fat boss smiled slyly: "Don't worry. They are all serious businessmen."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>The two of them sneered in unison at the same time.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "Ah... this fool!"</p>

    <p>Fat Boss: "Ah... this fool!"</p>

    <p>The probability is 3/100,000. I will let you draw 50 times. Can you beat me?</p>
