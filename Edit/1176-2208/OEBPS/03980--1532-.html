  <h1>Chapter 1532 Dao Ancestor Wang's "Relics"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Peng Xiren is no stranger to escape room games.</p>

    <p>When he was a child, Dao Ancestor Wang trapped him in the Heavenly Dao secret room for training.</p>

    <p>The difficulty is far greater than the artificially arranged mechanisms here.</p>

    <p>Standing here now, Peng Xiren is extremely melancholy.</p>

    <p>He looked at things and missed people. He also began to vaguely miss his missing master.</p>

    <p>Before Dao Ancestor Wang entered reincarnation, he didn't leave a single word to him. It seemed as if he wanted to deliberately cut off their master-disciple relationship.</p>

    <p>Walk decisively, walk cleanly, walk neatly...</p>

    <p>There was no room left for him.</p>

    <p>Not even the slightest clue.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren practiced hard after Dao Ancestor Wang entered reincarnation. He tried to find the whereabouts of Dao Ancestor Wang after reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, he failed.</p>

    <p>That man seemed to have evaporated from the world. As if he had become a speck of dust in the universe.</p>

    <p>So after that, Peng Xiren came to a conclusion that he couldn't believe, but had to believe.</p>

    <p>That is...</p>

    <p>His master. Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>He did not survive the tribulation of reincarnation. He died in the cycle of reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Although the probability of this is very small.</p>

    <p>But Peng Xiren thinks that this is still something that has a certain probability of happening.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had suspected before that the true identity of Wang Ling was Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>But later this answer was completely dismissed.</p>

    <p>Because the Dharma of Wang Ling is completely different from that of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Even if a person enters reincarnation, his or her Dharma will not change.</p>

    <p>There is one more thing.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling was Dao Ancestor Wang, he wouldn't have been so cruel, want to kill him...</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang was kind to him. Peng Xiren always remembered it and never forgot it.</p>

    <p>But now, the only person in the world who was good to him is gone.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>This world.</p>

    <p>What is the need for it to exist?</p>

    <p>Over the years, Peng Xiren has thought about this every time. The idea of reshaping the world of cultivation and subverting the entire universe has become stronger in his heart.</p>

    <p>And now. He is away from realizing this big plan.</p>

    <p>The last person standing in front of him.</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling must die.</p>

    <p>After possessing a contestant.</p>

    <p>The information in your mind is instantly synchronized.</p>

    <p>He possessed a female contestant.</p>

    <p>This person's name is: Matsushita Singha.</p>

    <p>A woman's body. This is not the first time Peng Xiren has possessed a woman's body.</p>

    <p>So I didn't feel there was anything I wasn't used to.</p>

    <p>He once possessed a female cultivator just for fun.</p>

    <p>Then he used his own body as a tool...</p>

    <p>I experienced it once. It was a different feeling.</p>

    <p>But that was all a long time ago.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After possessing Matsushita Singha, the first thing Peng Xiren did was to reposition Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is not difficult.</p>

    <p>But if you think about taking action here, the noise will be huge.</p>

    <p>He prefers to take a silent approach to attack Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then his body was displayed in reality in an extremely cruel way.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren has been prepared for this.</p>

    <p>He took out a jade box.</p>

    <p>Inside is a pair of snow-white pupils.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as a gift left by Dao Ancestor Wang to Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>It was found by Peng Xiren in his residence outside the tomb of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>His master has a magic weapon called "Eyeball Collector."</p>

    <p>It contains all kinds of strange and powerful pupils in the world.</p>

    <p>They come in different colors and are mounted in various boxes. Each pair possesses incomparable power.</p>

    <p>For the big guys in the cultivation world, changing "color contact lenses" is just a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>But eye-gouging is dangerous. It's still dangerous.</p>

    <p>It's beyond the realm of Soul Formation. Children should not imitate easily...</p>

    <p>Since losing to Wang Ling last time, Peng Xiren has been summarizing where exactly he lost.</p>

    <p>During the period of self-isolation in "Eating Star."</p>

    <p>He finally discovered that he might have been defeated by Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>So Peng Xiren quickly thought of the "relics" left by Dao Ancestor Wang that were not sealed in the tomb...</p>

    <p>For example, the "eyeball collector" he is holding now.</p>

    <p>This pair of "snow-white" pupils is named: Li Zhitong.</p>

    <p>It is a kind of pupil that can instantly drag people into a fictional world.</p>

    <p>The radiation is extremely strong.</p>

    <p>He estimated that Wang Ling was in a weak state now. Even if he was aware of it, he might not be able to escape the grasp of "Li Zhitong."</p>

    <p>I saw Peng Xiren slowly pricking his own two eyeballs, turning them gently like a plate of walnuts.</p>

    <p>His eyes turned into a piece of star sand and escaped into the starry space.</p>

    <p>Although the environment here is not the universe.</p>

    <p>But as the "son of the stars", the power of the stars controlled by Peng Xiren is still powerful.</p>

    <p>After changing into the snow-colored Li Zhitong.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren looked a little scary.</p>

    <p>In the pitch black, the pupils glowing with snow reflected a frightening light.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>It was just a soft call.</p>

    <p>Snow-colored ripples spread out from the pupils, centered on Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Li Zhitong will automatically lock objects based on his obsession and capture people into the created world.</p>

    <p>In fact, Peng Xiren helped Wang Ling with this step.</p>

    <p>Because at the moment Peng Xiren possessed Matsushita Singha.</p>

    <p>He had already sensed Peng Xiren's existence.</p>

    <p>I am also worried in my heart. If Peng Xiren chooses to attack him directly, the entire Sun Island and even the entire world will be affected by the battle between them...</p>

    <p>But now. Peng Xiren drags him into the other world.</p>

    <p>Instead, it helped Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This kind of behavior of giving pillows when sleepy comes makes Wang Ling feel a little happy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Completely relax your mental state. Imagine yourself as a fish floating on the sea.</p>

    <p>Let the ripples emitted by "Li Zhitong" draw you into the other world.</p>

    <p>"Very good! It's done!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Peng Xiren was overjoyed.</p>

    <p>Li Zhitong's capture was smoother than he imagined.</p>

    <p>The young man in front was quietly absorbed into it.</p>

    <p>So below...</p>

    <p>It's his turn to play!</p>

    <p>Because this is in the inner world. The surrounding scene looks no different from reality. But it is actually a fictional internal space.</p>

    <p>Except for the people who were dragged into the other world, no matter how loud the noise was, no one would notice it.</p>

    <p>After using magic to analyze the structure of the entire secret room, Peng Xiren followed the position of Wang Ling and explored it step by step...</p>

    <p>All this happened in just ten seconds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's breath is very close.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was only separated by a wall from the secret room where Wang Ling was located.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling... You lost..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren smiled secretly.</p>

    <p>The whole person instantly turned into nothingness. He merged his body into the wall. Like a ghost, he suddenly stretched out half of his body from the wall.</p>

    <p>However, Peng Xiren didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>The boy inside the wall seemed to have expected it. He was looking at him with his red eyes.</p>

    <p>He just leaned out.</p>

    <p>His head has already fallen into the palm of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It was stuck like a bowling ball.</p>
