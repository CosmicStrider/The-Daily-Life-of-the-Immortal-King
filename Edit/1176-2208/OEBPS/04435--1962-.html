  <h1>Chapter 1962 Qu Shuling is crazy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiutian Jingmi Courtyard. In front of the huge monitor, Teng Luchen and Jing Heqiu both wiped their eyes at this time.</p>

    <p>They are convinced that they are not mistaken...</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan's arrow was a "giant arrow!" It is the unique secret skill of Chu Tianjue, the only tenth-grade bow god in Huaxiu!</p>

    <p>In the world of archers, Chu Tianjue's name is as loud as thunder. He is the first among the ten ranks.</p>

    <p>Some people even think that if the grade can be expanded to the eleventh grade, Chu Tianjue's level should also be the level of the eleventh grade!</p>

    <p>But before, Teng Luchen had never heard that Chu Tianjue, the tenth-grade bow god, had accepted a disciple...</p>

    <p>"You can't be wrong, Mr. Teng. This is Master Chu Tian Jue Chu's giant arrow. The system data has been analyzed and compared. Whether it is the launch power or the angle of the arrow. Even the arrow body doubles after launch. The body shape and speed are all exactly the same!" Jing Heqiu was surprised. He conducted his own verification at the fastest speed.</p>

    <p>Back then, when the demon world and the cultivation world were still entangled, Chu Tianjue used this giant arrow to instantly kill a demon king.</p>

    <p>The data currently recorded in the system is Chu Tianjue's arrow back then.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, Chu Tianjue travels around the world. He is used to living as a casual cultivator and has no fixed residence. It may not be that easy to find his whereabouts.</p>

    <p>Many years ago, Teng Luchen had met Chu Tianjue. Under the modern cultivation environment, it was hard for him to imagine that there were still people living such a primitive life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, on Teng Luchen's side, he gave Chu Tianjue the nickname "Stop Cave Man."</p>

    <p>But when did this caveman take on a disciple...</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen really didn't know.</p>

    <p>"Is there still a way to find Chu Tianjue now?" Teng Luchen asked with a frown.</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao has also dealt with Teacher Chu. This person's whereabouts are mysterious. The dragon has its head but not its tail. I'm afraid it's not that easy to find. If we want to find him, we can only do our best..." Jing Heqiu said.</p>

    <p>"That's all." Teng Luchen waved his hand: "He doesn't even use a mobile phone. It's not easy to find this caveman. But I can be sure. This Zhang Linyan must be his disciple. You also have the data for comparison. I just scanned it Eye. Aren't they exactly the same!"</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao Hideaki..."</p>

    <p>"The harvest from this spiritual world trial is still great." Teng Luchen also became happy.</p>

    <p>Although his original intention was to test Wang Ling, he found nothing about Wang Ling so far. Instead, he dug out Zhang Linyan, a talent who inherited the bloodline of the Arrow God.</p>

    <p>"It's really the Yangtze River Houlang that pushes the boundaries."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was also very sad about this. Zhang Linyan had never used this trick before. Now he used it against Qu Shuling. It was considered to be a confirmation of his identity.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, in the picture on the monitor, the battle is not over yet.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Linyan's arrow shot out, Qu Shuling was caught off guard.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of Wang Ling and Li Changzhe. Qu Shuling was about to be sent away directly by Zhang Linyan's arrow.</p>

    <p>The destructive power of the Jinghong Giant Arrow is huge. It is far beyond imagination. In addition, it is secretly blessed by Wang Ling. The spiritual energy erupted by this arrow has far exceeded Zhang Linyan's own realm.</p>

    <p>An arrow that no one can defend against. Anyone who is shot will be sent away directly.</p>

    <p>Facing this giant arrow protruding from his face, Qu Shuling's expression changed with shock. He could no longer maintain his initial calmness. Big beads of sweat rolled down his cheeks.</p>

    <p>Then, use all your strength to block the explosive power of the giant arrow.</p>

    <p>He also got a lot of magic weapons from the spirit world. In order to protect himself from being eliminated, he threw them all away almost in an instant.</p>

    <p>However, these magic weapons could not block the trajectory of the giant arrow at all. The moment they were thrown, they were directly smashed by the sharp edge of the giant arrow.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, it seems that you are going to be sent away directly today. I didn't expect that you won't be able to survive the sect competition three days later." Li Changzhe had already laughed in advance.</p>

    <p>He really didn't expect that even Qu Shuling would be where he is today.</p>

    <p>Seeing this arrogant high school student who was a top genius languishing here, Li Changzhe felt an indescribable sense of joy in his heart.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Finally, the arrow hit Qu Shuling. It was obvious that the protective shield had been triggered. The system determined that this huge arrow had posed a life threat to Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the huge arrow collided with the protective shield, the impact of the explosion shook everyone within a hundred miles. The huge explosion air wave rolled backwards, blowing the dense forest at the scene into a barren land.</p>

    <p>The group of miners who followed were dumbfounded. They were watching the battle in daze and silence. At this time, many of them were swept up high by the blast of air and were knocked off their feet.</p>

    <p>The duel between high school students was too fierce. It exceeded their expectations and imagination.</p>

    <p>Although they didn't understand why today's high school students can be so aggressive, they were shocked...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is.</p>

    <p>The protective shield mechanism is triggered.</p>

    <p>The most popular song in the trial, Qu Shuling, is about to be eliminated.</p>

    <p>This is beyond everyone's expectation.</p>

    <p>"It's finally over." Li Changzhe felt happy. Without Qu Shuling, a difficult and arrogant guy, their subsequent trials should be much easier.</p>

    <p>And the key is. Zhang Lin Yanxiong is here!</p>

    <p>As soon as the identity of the disciple of the Arrow God is revealed, it will surely shock the entire high school circle in Huaxiu Country!</p>

    <p>Although Zhang Linyan's school ranking is not as good as that of Shengke, she will definitely become famous because of this. With this status, she will be directly alongside Qu Shuling and Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, when the smoke and dust from the explosion subsided, along with a breeze from the valley, the fog at the scene was blown away.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling, who was covered in rags after being blown up, was still standing there holding the pitch-black Zhanye...</p>

    <p>"What's going on? The protective shield has obviously been triggered." Wang Ling was puzzled.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that such a good offensive just now didn't even send Qu Shuling away.</p>

    <p>"I understand!" Li Changzhe said in shock; "It must be a privilege card! Qu Shuling must have used that privilege card to keep himself here! I bet that privilege card is actually a resurrection coin!"</p>

    <p>He was also stunned when he saw Qu Shuling. After thinking about it for a long time, he understood. All this was the function of the privilege card that allowed Qu Shuling to not be forcibly taken away from the scene after the protective shield was triggered!</p>

    <p>"A disciple of the Arrow God..." Qu Shuling raised the corners of his lips and sneered.</p>

    <p>"..." Zhang Linyan was speechless.</p>

    <p>She really wanted to say that she had nothing to do with Chu Tianjue.</p>

    <p>The shocking giant arrow shot just now was really just a coincidence.</p>

    <p>But when the words came to her lips, Zhang Linyan felt that no matter what she said now, Qu Shuling would not believe it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it will anger Qu Shuling, causing him to take even more extreme actions.</p>

    <p>Because his current state is already very wrong.</p>

    <p>No one has ever turned this decent genius into such a miserable state.</p>

    <p>He stood on the battlefield in ragged clothes. His face showed a look of enthusiasm that had been ruined: "It turns out... you are all hiding..."</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Wang Ling: "You are a mascot..."</p>

    <p>Then he glanced at Li Changzhe: "Then what are you? You must also have a hidden identity, right?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "..."</p>
