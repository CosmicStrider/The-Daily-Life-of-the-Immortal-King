  <h1>Chapter 1394 The mantis stalks the cicada and the oriole follows behind</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When he just left the school gate, Sun Rong noticed a group of suspicious people following Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>These people were secretly wearing invisibility charms. However, this level of invisibility was completely exposed to Aohai's sword energy.</p>

    <p>Aohai's sword energy is like a radar. It can easily scan ordinary invisible units.</p>

    <p>At first she didn't know that this group of people also came for the love letter that Chen Chao was carrying.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Aohai used sword energy to introduce the secret conversations of the stalkers ahead to her ears that Sun Rong confirmed the other party's purpose.</p>

    <p>"Attention. There are still a lot of people around now. Don't take action now. There is a dark alley ahead. There is an opportunity. The task of our group is just a love letter!"</p>

    <p>"Understood. Just grab the love letter and knock the person unconscious."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was shocked after hearing these words.</p>

    <p>Forget it if there are men who compete with women for men these days.</p>

    <p>There are actually men who compete for love letters from women...</p>

    <p>She has been single for a long time. She looks pretty even when reading a love letter?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that the whole love letter incident revealed a strange feeling.</p>

    <p>She knew that among the hundreds of love letters, someone must be playing a prank behind her back. But what if a few of them were true?</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong decided to investigate after being confused for a whole day.</p>

    <p>In addition, the girl also keenly captured one thing from the conversation just now.</p>

    <p>That's what one of them said was "the mission of our group." Does that mean there's actually a second group, and a third group of people plotting something else?</p>

    <p>It seems like this was a premeditated action!</p>

    <p>The goal of this group may be more than just love letters!</p>

    <p>At this moment, a very terrible thing suddenly occurred to the girl's mind.</p>

    <p>Could it be that someone hid some important information in these love letters?</p>

    <p>She thought of the common scenes in movies and TV series.</p>

    <p>A group of extremely vicious criminals. In order to ensure that no evidence of crime is left behind, they use primitive methods to transmit information, communicate in code words, and then plan terrorist attacks!</p>

    <p>Today is the first day back at Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>This group of suspicious people chose to appear at this time. There must be something wrong!</p>

    <p>And this morning, a teleportation circle in the school square was broken.</p>

    <p>That's a newly built magic circle!</p>

    <p>Who knows if this group of people did it!?</p>

    <p>"No. This group of people must be stopped." Sun Rong originally went there for Chen Chao's love letter.</p>

    <p>As a result, while following her all the way, she noticed this group of suspicious guys!</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong feels that he doesn't care, the situation may develop into a more serious direction.</p>

    <p>The purpose of classmate Wang Ling upgrading her spirit sword is not to enable her to protect herself, protect her friends and partners around her, and get justice in a timely manner?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong behind.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing, Wang Zhen and Wang Ling at the end all opened their mouths involuntarily.</p>

    <p>After they used the art of telepathy to listen to the girl's thoughts, their facial expressions and movements were in sync. They all looked stunned.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Sun Rong deserves to be Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>This way, I only walked less than 100 meters after leaving the school gate. I actually imagined the script like this!</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling lowered his head, put his hands in his trouser pockets, and walked forward pretending to be nothing.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said that another group of people was actually behind Wang Ling. They also had invisibility charms attached to their bodies. They were moving sneakily. However, the leader seemed very cautious.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui followed with another group of people. Although he had already confirmed the locations of Wang Ling and Sun Rong in front of him, he had yet to find a suitable opportunity to take action.</p>

    <p>He looked around with vigilant eyes. Sweat broke out on his forehead: "These idiots! Do you think you'll be fine just by putting on the invisibility charm? You don't even know if you've been discovered!"</p>

    <p>All we can say is that Lao Hui is Lao Hui after all. He is a Nascent Soul master after all. He was aware of the exposure of his actions early on.</p>

    <p>"Were they exposed? No way! Aren't the enemies we have to deal with only at the Foundation Building stage? The invisibility charm given by Brother Jiang is a high-end product. Even those at the Nascent Soul stage can't tell the difference!" said a boy.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche spent huge sums of money to prepare props for this operation.</p>

    <p>He is the chief secretary-general of the Huaguo Shuilian Group and a personal figure around Mr. Boss Sun. How could he support the operation with goods from the street stalls?</p>

    <p>"I don't know what's going on..." Lao Hui was also puzzled.</p>

    <p>Who knows why a Foundation Building period has such a strong identification ability?</p>

    <p>Instead, these thugs from Golden Core and Nascent Soul are treated like street vendors!</p>

    <p>They also cultivated step by step!</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Hui felt very depressed.</p>

    <p>They are all people who made mistakes when they were young and have a criminal record. Therefore, no company dares to hire them even if they have high standards.</p>

    <p>These days, even moving bricks on a construction site requires investigation...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Lao Hui could only take the lead in starting this kind of business and joined the "Loyalty Group."</p>

    <p>It sounds like a mafia, but it is actually a social and emotional organization that specializes in testing the emotions between men and women...</p>

    <p>They are said to be "thugs." In fact, they never really hit anyone after they were good soldiers. They just played the role of "thugs."</p>

    <p>"What should I do? Miss Sun has noticed them. Do you want to cancel the operation?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui is also struggling with this issue.</p>

    <p>Ever since they joined the "Loyalty Group", they have never failed on a mission.</p>

    <p>There are countless scumbag men and women who have fully exposed their humanity under their deliberate intimidation.</p>

    <p>When faced with danger, there are many couples who choose to protect each other and face danger together. But when their lives are in danger, according to the cases Lao Hui participated in, most people will choose to push the people around them out. Then run away alone...</p>

    <p>According to Jiang Xiaoche's original plan, Lao Hui and the others planned to record Wang Ling's reaction after taking action against Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And now the group that went to snatch the love letters has been exposed.</p>

    <p>The mission seems to be unable to continue.</p>

    <p>But Lao Hui felt that this might be a good opportunity.</p>

    <p>Because snatching love letters is not the main purpose of the operation...</p>

    <p>"Now Miss Sun's attention is focused on the group of people in front. I think now is the right time to act." At this time, Lao Hui gritted his teeth and took out a tube of purple reagent from his Qiankun bag.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" the boy next to him asked.</p>

    <p>This was not originally a prop used in this operation. But in order to ensure the success of the operation, Lao Hui decided to use his own collection: "This is the "Water of Fear." The fear gas inside will evaporate quickly after falling to the ground. A radius of 500 meters Within. The party with low combat power will deepen the fear of the party with high combat power. It is an excellent tool to test those scumbag men and scumbag women! The greater the realm span, the stronger the fear effect. In severe cases, it will directly cause shock!"</p>

    <p>"Is it so useful?"</p>

    <p>"But the effect only lasts 3 minutes. So we must fight quickly!"</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lao Hui, who was following Wang Ling, immediately threw the reagent on the ground.</p>

    <p>Along with the continuous volatilization of gas.</p>

    <p>Lao Hui and the younger brothers around him suddenly felt a feeling of myocardial infarction when facing the back of Wang Ling...</p>
