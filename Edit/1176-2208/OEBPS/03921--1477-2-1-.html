  <h1>Chapter 1477 Make a wish and the clear spring flows</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling waited for less than thirty minutes before several people came out of the locker room.</p>

    <p>For thousands of years, the overall style of Hanfu has been light and simple.</p>

    <p>Although the pattern is simple, everyone has their own look when wearing it.</p>

    <p>When you wear Hanfu, it has a subtle literary style, and you feel like you are traveling back in time.</p>

    <p>And this is also the reason why Hanfu culture has been sought after by so many young people in modern times.</p>

    <p>The Hanfu that Li Youyue chose is called "Yueyuehongfeng." It is a red Hanfu with maple leaves and white rust patterns symbolizing fire.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's personal point of view, this red Hanfu is indeed very consistent with Li Youyue's own temperament.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue is a sunny girl who is passionate about making delicious food and deals with flames all year round. Her outgoing personality can be felt from this simple Hanfu.</p>

    <p>"Where is Sun Rong?" On the other side, Chen Chao and Guo Hao also came out.</p>

    <p>The two brothers chose the same style. Its name is "Ye Lan Bu Jing." It is a set of Hanfu that is mainly black. There is a little white base part. But there is a saying...this set of "Ye Lan Bu Jing" is The top effect looks very average on Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>"Why did you two choose this one? It doesn't suit you!"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue raised her forehead and said, "Didn't I tell you before? It would be better if you choose the red and gold ones."</p>

    <p>Regarding straight male aesthetics, any girl will always feel helpless when seeing...</p>

    <p>Boys usually don't care too much about their own grooming. Clothes are mostly affected by the environment. People are not born with the ability to dress up. This needs to be cultivated slowly.</p>

    <p>Hanfu upper body. Everyone is different. So Li Youyue feels that this is definitely not a problem with clothes...</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao and Guo Hao themselves don't quite fit the temperament of Hanfu.</p>

    <p>One is a hot-blooded, smooth-mouthed boy with strong muscles who is addicted to games but never forgets to exercise.</p>

    <p>One is a ten-year fat geek who is addicted to gaming but just doesn't work out and flirts with his parrot at home all day long.</p>

    <p>When the two came out wearing this set of Hanfu, Li Youyue felt that Chen Chao and Guo Hao were like the silly sons of a landlord... The scene was a bit unbearable to watch.</p>

    <p>"The main reason is that old Guo doesn't have the right size, and this nightmare is the only one. I can't help it, in order not to embarrass old Guo, this brother of mine must of course accompany him." Chen Chao wrapped one hand around Guo Hao's neck and smiled with his teeth.</p>

    <p>Of course he knew that this Hanfu didn't really match his temperament. But Chen Chao didn't care too much whether it looked good or not.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Chen Chao himself has no idol baggage.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the protagonist tonight is not them...</p>

    <p>Besides, even if you really find the right Hanfu.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao feels that the upper body effect is far worse than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That set of "Izumo Flying to the Moon" was really thought-provoking. When Wang Ling came out of the locker room before, even Chen Chao's eyes were straight.</p>

    <p>In essence, people will always cast their eyes on beautiful things without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Even a straight man like him fell for it. Those little girls who took out their mobile phones and took pictures excitedly. It is not difficult to understand why they behave in such a disrespectful manner.</p>

    <p>So. In the locker room, he and Guo Hao had already made a decision.</p>

    <p>When I watch the fountain show later, I'll find an excuse to escape. Just leave the scene to Boss Sun...</p>

    <p>There are so many people watching the fountain.</p>

    <p>There are so many people and so many eyes. It's not uncommon even if you get separated along with the crowd.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He knew it!</p>

    <p>These two traitors are unreliable...</p>

    <p>About three minutes passed. Sun Rong's voice suddenly sounded: "Sorry... I kept everyone waiting."</p>

    <p>The girl is wearing a dark blue Hanfu. The blue top is dotted with stars. The white skirt is like a bright moon in a quiet lake. Everything perfectly reflects the real name of this Hanfu: Bright Moon Glaze.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao looked at it with dull eyes. They felt that Sun Rong at this moment was like a glass immortal walking out of a painting. It made people's minds slightly rippling at first, and then quickly fell into a kind of calmness. </p>

    <p>There is a kind of time standing still. The beauty of quiet time.</p>

    <p>"How about...isn't it... not pretty..." Sun Rong has a bright moon fan in his hand.</p>

    <p>This is a small decoration that goes with this Hanfu suit. Her actor even shyly covered his expression and stared intently at the young man in white in front of him.</p>

    <p>But the expression on Wang Ling's face was not that surprising, because he could actually think of Sun Rong wearing Hanfu.</p>

    <p>Although people rely on clothes, Buddha relies on gold. Clothes can indeed bring a completely different spirit to a person. But... the most important point is that people must look good.</p>

    <p>When a person's good-looking level has reached a saturated state, change a set of clothes and it will still be saturated...</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling doesn't know how to evaluate it.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, it was Guo Hao and Chen Chao who sighed from the bottom of their hearts.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Why don't you say a few words?"</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling didn't reply for a long time, Li Youyue became a little anxious. She cleared her throat and taught him in the tone of an old lady: "When a girl needs evaluation, you have to evaluate it. This But the most basic courtesy!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this step is a bit like a survival test.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's a compliment.</p>

    <p>He won't tell either. There is some truth.</p>

    <p>"she..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling looked at the girl and said, "She is pretty."</p>

    <p>This is indeed what Wang Ling thinks to be the truth. But when he said it, Sun Rong's face immediately became hot!</p>

    <p>She was stunned. Wang Ling actually said that...</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The girl felt as if her heart was hit hard by something. She immediately covered her shy face with a round fan.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue saw that there seemed to be smoke coming out from behind the fan.</p>

    <p>"Are you satisfied now?" She leaned her face closer and said quietly to the steam girl behind the fan. The girl's face couldn't help but become even redder.</p>

    <p>Then, Li Youyue turned her attention to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I saw the young man in front of me. His expression was calm and untroubled...</p>

    <p>Li Youyue crossed her arms. She felt a little depressed. She suddenly felt that Wang Ling's wood properties were hopeless.</p>

    <p>She muttered helplessly in her heart: "So... he really doesn't know that he is very flirtatious..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone has finished dressing up. The next step is to enjoy the night fountain show.</p>

    <p>The Dragon Fountain in the ancient street is very famous. And it has been around for a certain period of time. It was built by an emperor Wang Ling under the old imperial system to please his beloved concubine.</p>

    <p>The entire fountain is as big as two basketball courts. There are 88 copper faucet fountain mouths. Hence the name Dragon.</p>

    <p>As for the water source of the fountain, it is drawn from the nearby Longya Mountain.</p>

    <p>This is a big project. It was once regarded as a symbol of the emperor's exploitation of the working people at the bottom...</p>

    <p>He didn't know when it started. Dragon from Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street became an internet celebrity. Even the story was changed... into a wonderful and touching love story between an infatuated emperor and an innocent concubine.</p>

    <p>With this change, Dragon suddenly became a famous tourist attraction.</p>

    <p>Touching the faucet, tossing coins, and praying at the edge of the fountain have almost become a necessary process before the fountain show starts.</p>

    <p>"I have prepared some coins. Before the fountain show starts, let's make a wish!" At this time, Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>She distributed 1 yuan coins to everyone one by one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling followed the example of the passers-by. First touch the copper faucet by the fountain.</p>

    <p>When I touched it, I realized that my faucet was different from the one next door...</p>

    <p>Because he touched the dragon's head. The dragon's horns had been smoothed.</p>

    <p>It's okay to be touched bald...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. He just touched it lightly. Then he set a timed repair spell for the faucet he touched.</p>

    <p>Since this dragon head has been touched by myself, it is the fate of this dragon head.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it would be a good thing to fix it myself.</p>

    <p>Once the timed repair spell is set up, everything will be fine.</p>

    <p>When the dragon head is not noticed by anyone, its dragon horns will grow out while others are not paying attention.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling followed the example of others and gently placed the coins into the pool.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare to imitate some people who just threw it. If he threw it too hard, the coin would be about as powerful as a nuclear torpedo...</p>

    <p>Then, it's time to close your eyes and make a wish.</p>

    <p>"Make a wish! The clear spring flows!" Chen Chao made rapid progress.</p>

    <p>He made a wish and shouted at the same time, startling everyone nearby.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a veteran player of tainted milk powder for ten years...</p>

    <p>On the side, Guo Hao smiled. This is a game gag. Only those who understand will understand.</p>

    <p>Then he closed his eyes and started his wish-making process.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the pious faces of everyone nearby. He was also thinking about his own wishes.</p>

    <p>In fact, sometimes people make wishes just to give themselves psychological comfort so that they can better put down their burdens and move forward.</p>

    <p>There are actually many rumors about Dragon's efficacious effects.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not sure if it is true.</p>

    <p>After all, these days businesses are doing anything to hype up tourist attractions...</p>

    <p>Make up a beautiful story like a fairy tale. That is considered kind.</p>

    <p>A while ago, a scenic spot called "Sky Realm" appeared. It is said to be the first domestic scenic spot to be built by spending huge sums of money.</p>

    <p>The blue sky and white clouds in the "Sky Realm" in the attraction's promotional poster look like a dream or a fantasy.</p>

    <p>But the real classic in reality is just a few mirrors covered with muddy shoe prints placed on the pond...</p>

    <p>Real. The difference between a "buyer's show" and a "seller's show."</p>

    <p>But regardless of whether it works or not...</p>

    <p>It's better to believe in making a wish.</p>

    <p>You still have to have dreams. What if they come true?</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it didn't open for a long time.</p>

    <p>Mainly. He has too many wishes...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Must have made a wish to eat more dry noodles with different flavors, right?" Sun Rong looked at the young man with his eyes closed, a serious expression on his face, and a sweet smile.</p>

    <p>Then, she closed her eyes and made her wish to Dragon sincerely.</p>

    <p>Her wish is.</p>

    <p>No matter what Wang Ling wishes, it will come true...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Caught up." On the other side, Zhuo Yi also came to the scene with Jiugong.</p>

    <p>They also changed into Hanfu and came here.</p>

    <p>What's worth complaining about is that they are wearing the same style...</p>

    <p>They all chose the Hanfu set called "Purple Gold Galaxy."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi chose Hanfu in the locker room. He had never been with Zhuo Yi before. But under such circumstances, a coincidence could still happen...</p>

    <p>Although the male version of "Purple Gold Galaxy" and the female version are different in texture and pattern.</p>

    <p>However, the highly similar color scheme makes the two of them look like a couple when they stand together.</p>

    <p>Is it a coincidence?</p>

    <p>Of course not...</p>

    <p>There are so many styles of Hanfu. How can you choose the same one?</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhuo Yi asked a good friend to help Jiugong Liangzi choose clothes. He just made some inquiries.</p>

    <p>Of course. Such a little trick. Zhuo Yi cannot be revealed.</p>

    <p>As soon as he came out, he showed a very surprised expression. He lamented that his and Jiugong Liangzi's brain circuits were similar. He also used some words such as "the earth is created by heaven" and "the heart is connected" to add insult to injury.</p>

    <p>It directly caused the girl's blushing and it still hasn't cooled down yet.</p>

    <p>Of course. In this case, you only need to change into a new set of Hanfu.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi felt that since it was nothing, there was no need to hide it too much. It would be better to be more open-minded...</p>

    <p>To be honest, she herself didn't know why such magical logic appeared at that time.</p>

    <p>Until he actually walked down the street wearing the same Hanfu as Zhuo Yi. Jiugong Liangzi once wanted to slap himself with a big mouth...</p>

    <p>"I'm telling you, don't get too close to me...it's too easy for people to misunderstand..." Jiugong Liangzi muttered by the fountain.</p>

    <p>There was a lot of people nearby. But it was easy for Zhuo Yi to distinguish Jiugong Liangzi's voice among the sounds.</p>

    <p>But he deliberately pretended not to hear. He just smiled at the girl in front of him and said, "What?"</p>

    <p>He is slightly taller than Jiugong. Looking at Jiugong from this angle, this girl's slightly soft and cute voice is like a cat's paw, scratching Zhuo Yi's heart.</p>

    <p>"I said, don't get too close to me. Otherwise, you will be misunderstood..." Jiugong Liangzi tried to speak louder.</p>

    <p>"What? You want me to get closer to you? Okay!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Shameless...</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched. She was 100% sure that Zhuo Yi heard it. He was definitely teasing her.</p>

    <p>The girl clenched her fists hard and tried hard not to have an attack.</p>

    <p>Then, she simply stood up on tiptoes and planned to speak directly into Zhuo Yi's ear.</p>

    <p>This distance... this old liar can't hear it anymore!</p>

    <p>However, what Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect was that just as she stood on tiptoe, Zhuo Yi also lowered her head, planning to take out the coins from her pocket.</p>

    <p>At this moment, their foreheads actually touched lightly!</p>

    <p>Instantly, Jiugong Liangzi blushed uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>She turned around sharply. Her back was to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No...nothing..."</p>

    <p>"Am I too close?"</p>

    <p>"Forget it...there are so many people...that's it..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the girl added: "When there are fewer people, please stay away from me immediately... Do you understand..."</p>

    <p>"Understood." Zhuo Yi smiled fondly.</p>
