  <h1>Chapter 1914 The Gray Cult Commission Forcibly Completed</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After returning from the Eternal World, due to the correction of the trajectory of the will of the universe, everyone's memory of that period in the Eternal Period has been blurred.</p>

    <p>But somehow. Sun Rong found that she remembered these things clearly.</p>

    <p>Her instinctive sixth sense told her that Wang Ling must have done something in this. Otherwise, it makes no sense that she is the only one who still remembers those things from the eternal period.</p>

    <p>So what does Wang Ling think of her now?</p>

    <p>After returning to the real world. Sun Rong was thinking about this issue.</p>

    <p>At least in the past, she felt that Wang Ling was far away from her and an unreachable person...</p>

    <p>Now. Although the relationship has not developed into a confirmed intimate relationship, she can really help Wang Ling. So does this count as being regarded as a friend by Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Sun Rong couldn't help but feel better: "Ying'er? Ying'er?"</p>

    <p>She called Sun Ying'er in her heart. She wanted to ask Sun Ying'er for her opinion. Then she realized that Sun Ying'er had been called over by Wang Ying again.</p>

    <p>She was the only one left in the empty bedroom again...</p>

    <p>Having said that, she also felt that this eternal experience was indeed a bit incredible. Who would have thought that Sun Ying'er could actually travel directly into the body of a baby.</p>

    <p>No wonder we hadn't been able to find her.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Friday, January 9th. Today is the day when Wang Ling and Sun Rong both return to school.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quickly went through the content of the recent class in a few tens of seconds. After confirming that it was all the cultivation knowledge that he had mastered, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>You can't be sloppy when studying. If you don't know something, you have to ask questions without shame. Otherwise, it would be bad to keep procrastinating until the exam.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, daily study is not just about learning knowledge. It is also a good opportunity to understand other people's learning status.</p>

    <p>Because as long as you know how much most people understand and master this piece of knowledge, you can better predict the scores of everyone in the class in advance during the exam, thereby better achieving score reduction.</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling didn't come for two days. He was still a little panicked. He was afraid that he didn't guess the score and did too well on the test. Then he was pulled out by Teacher Pan to give typical praise or something.</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, the person who comforted him was Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>He had a cordial discussion with Sun Ying'er last night. He was in the right mood: "Why are you panicking? You have been studying in this class for so long. It would be weird to have an average score every time. Occasionally take the test and do better. If you tell the outside world, it will be an extraordinary performance. It will not make people feel strange."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's words immediately made Wang Ling's eyes light up.</p>

    <p>He thought it made sense.</p>

    <p>That's right. He kept getting low marks every time, which made him feel even more stressed every time he took the exam. Occasionally, he got an above-average score. It really wouldn't feel too strange.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking in his mind. He subconsciously looked at the empty seat in the middle of the row next to him. That was Sun Rong's seat. Like him, Sun Rong also arrived at class in the morning. He started to borrow various notes to check whether he had missed any knowledge points. It was now noon. She was probably busy dealing with the tasks entrusted by the Student Council and Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Wang Ling finds that he is quite envious of Sun Rong. At least Sun Rong doesn't have to worry about scoring average in the exam. Shee can do well every time.</p>

    <p>And this excellence is taken for granted in everyone's eyes. No one will be surprised that Sun Rong got particularly good results in the exam.</p>

    <p>So this time, how about just like Wang Ying said... don't think about the issue of scoring? Occasionally get average results?</p>

    <p>Indeed. Wang Ling thinks this may be the most natural situation.</p>

    <p>After all, Teacher Pan had begun to vaguely wonder if he had deliberately suppressed the score.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the student union office. Sun Rong and Xia Ming are waiting seriously. As the newly appointed deputy director of the Gray Cult branch of Number 60 High School, Xia Ming has been completely fanned by Wang Ling since the last Jiulong Mountain Gymnastics Conference. Now, he is under the leadership of the Number 60 High School Student Council. He is also the deputy minister of the Number 60 High School Gray Cult part-time. He performs his duties of recording very conscientiously.</p>

    <p>Regarding the investigation of the missing video blogger. Sun Rong has also made up a story here.</p>

    <p>The video blogger herself does not actually exist. Because it is a virtual person created by the will of the universe... But this matter is really involved. Sun Rong can not directly tell the whole story to Chen Qin. So she had to start making up a story with the cooperation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, after everyone from the Office of Strategic Deception came back on January 8th, Wang Ling used his own methods to restore Li Xuan. In other words, the current Li Xuan no longer belongs to the will of the universe. It is a living person constructed by Wang Ling using magic.</p>

    <p>So the story Sun Rong made up now is actually to reasonably explain the specific reason why Li Xuan disappeared.</p>

    <p>"It's this classmate Chen Qin. That girl Li Xuan who looks very similar to you. We have found her." Sun Rong said seriously while sitting on the chair.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming remained silent on the side and started typing on the keyboard. He did not know the specific execution process of the entrusted task. He was only responsible for recording. Then the recorded things were finally written into reports for Gray Cult's external publicity.</p>

    <p>"Yes! I know! I saw her new short video update! The platform has restored her account!" Chen Qin was also very excited.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that her commission was actually accepted. And it was resolved in a very short period of time!</p>

    <p>Gray Cult. yyds<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("永遠的神" Equivalent to "GOAT" or "Greatest Of All Time")</dfn>

    <p>"So what happened to this girl Li Xuan?" Chen Qin was very curious. She asked about the details of the mission. It was within the reasonable range of the client's questions.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had known that such a question would be asked. Therefore, the expression on her face was particularly calm: "Do you know Mr. Wu who was captured recently?"</p>

    <p>"Ah! So it's that illusionist Wu Tiao? The one who specializes in using hallucinogenic spells to coerce and lure young girls into having improper relationships with him... the scumbag!"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Sun Rong nodded: "Hey. This girl Li Xuan is actually a victim. But she has the courage to stand up and try to expose all this..."</p>

    <p>Having said that, everything that happened next seemed to have come to light. Chen Qin showed an expression of sudden realization. Obviously, she did not expect that she would make such a commission casually. Things would be so exciting: "That's why she suddenly disappeared. Is it actually Wu Tiao's public relations ploy? Because Miss Li wanted to report it. So he tried to make her disappear?"</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Rong stood up and held Chen Qin's hand firmly: "Fortunately, we discovered it in time... This didn't lead to a big disaster. And it's also thanks to Chen Qin's help. Reporting gave us this opportunity to defeat the evil forces! Thank you! Classmate Chen Qin! The world of cultivation is wonderful because of you!"</p>

    <p>On the side, Xia Ming was typing and was shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how to describe his mood for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then he typed a radical on the screen: "艸!"</p>
