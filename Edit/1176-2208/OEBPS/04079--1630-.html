  <h1>Chapter 1630 Crazy Fengchu</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong was focusing on collecting evidence against Mrs. Fengchu. Unexpectedly, a major earthquake had erupted outside Songhai City at this moment.</p>

    <p>With the Office of Strategic Deception as the core of the command, all the cultivators who were summoned formed an alliance army and were on the way to outflank the Fengchu Laboratory in the northern suburbs.</p>

    <p>It is naturally impossible to completely conceal such a large-scale operation. At best, some control of public opinion is required at the beginning. In the end, it will definitely explode on the Internet in an unstoppable situation.</p>

    <p>As one of the core teams within Fengchu Laboratory, the task of the Intelligence Section is naturally to always pay attention to any disturbance on the Internet.</p>

    <p>The chief of the intelligence department Hang Chuan also received the news from the headset immediately. He immediately reported to Liu Renfeng: "Madam, there seems to be a lot of strange news on the Internet today."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Come and listen."</p>

    <p>"Someone saw many cultivators from the sect walking through the downtown area in a neat square formation with swords."</p>

    <p>"Interesting." Liu Renfeng held his chin and thought for a moment: "Have you found out what activities they are doing?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that the Office of Strategic Deception is organizing the Alliance Army to conduct exercises."</p>

    <p>"Exercise?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. But these news are just hearsay at present. There is no substantive evidence. We are still trying to understand the situation. Before that, for the sake of safety, Madam, do you want to..."</p>

    <p>"No need. It's just an exercise." Liu Renfeng's expression gradually became crazy: "I have been waiting for this day for too long. Now I don't want to delay it for a second."</p>

    <p>"But Madam, there are still risks in this matter..."</p>

    <p>"No need to say more." Liu Renfeng waved his hand: "If this alliance army from the Office of Strategic Deception really came to my base in the northern suburbs, they would never be so arrogant. Moreover, it was just for a little girl. To start a war like this would be too disrespectful to me Liu Renfeng."</p>

    <p>After saying that. The crazy woman also looked at Sun Ying'er, who was pretending to be Jiang Yingying: "Girl. You should be more relaxed. Even if these people are really here to save you. It's useless. No one can save you now."</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng smiled. Immediately he walked to a very technological door: "Hang Chuan. You and Zhang San come together. Follow here."</p>

    <p>"Madam... that is a restricted area... you never let us enter..." The head of the intelligence department was flattered. He quickly lowered his head, looking at a loss.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. Everything will be over soon. The Intelligence Department is my confidant. You work under me. You always have to know something."</p>

    <p>She said meaningfully. Then she glanced at Sun Ying'er again: "Girl Jiang, after this incident is over, maybe you should thank me, because in this world, I can help you get rid of the pain." It's just me, Fengchu."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong and Sun Ying'er were confused and didn't understand the deeper meaning.</p>

    <p>However, starting from entering this underground base, judging from the various information collected so far, Sun Rong can basically conclude that Jiang Yingying is not as simple as imagined.</p>

    <p>Although she is the adopted daughter of Marshal Jiang, her origin seems to be unusual. She is not an ordinary orphan, but some kind of special existence...</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng led the way. Four people were passing through a long glass tunnel. The glass display cabinets on the side were filled with various specimens of spirit animal organs. Combined with the dim light, it looked a little eye-catching.</p>

    <p>"You crazy bitch. What do you mean?" Sun Ying'er tried to borrow Jiang Yingying's tone of voice.</p>

    <p>"Haven't you noticed that your health is getting worse?" Liu Renfeng did not answer Sun Ying'er's question directly. Instead, he asked rhetorically like this.</p>

    <p>"It seems a bit..." Sun Ying'er replied.</p>

    <p>Her health is indeed getting worse. But the main reason is because of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>The most commonly used side effect of Planet thumping technique is back pain.</p>

    <p>There is nothing we can do about this.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Liu Renfeng said: "Because your body is not compatible with the first generation of artificial spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>"Artificial spiritual roots?"</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong and Sun Ying'er were stunned at the same time.</p>

    <p>It's not that Sun Rong doesn't understand the matter of artificial spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>Under today's world system of universal cultivation, the strength of spiritual roots represents future talent.</p>

    <p>A long time ago, some cultivators often went to extremes to give birth to children with excellent spiritual roots. That is, they consumed a large number of supplements during pregnancy, so that when their children were born, their spiritual roots would reach a high-quality level.</p>

    <p>But the effects of supplements are actually very limited.</p>

    <p>So, just a few decades ago, the topic of artificial spiritual roots became a hot topic at that time.</p>

    <p>If a child whose spiritual roots are not excellent at birth can reach the level of an excellent cultivator through artificial spiritual roots, then this technology will become a ready-made money printing machine. Whether it is the current market or the future market, it will have Big picture!</p>

    <p>At the beginning, scientific research teams from various countries conducted experiments on spiritual beasts by studying the spiritual roots in their bodies.</p>

    <p>However, in order to seek breakthroughs as soon as possible, some scientists began to use the black market to purchase slaves to provide mice for their laboratories.</p>

    <p>The progress brought about by experimenting with spiritual beasts thousands of times may not be as much as the progress achieved by experimenting once on a real cultivator.</p>

    <p>When this incident was exposed, it caused an uproar around the world.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't realize that Mrs. Fengchu had been studying this very thing...</p>

    <p>But now, the "artificial spiritual root" experiment has been proven to be against human ethics and has been strictly prohibited long ago.</p>

    <p>The more she listened, the more she felt that there was something wrong with what Liu Renfeng said...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>The spiritual roots in Jiang Yingying's body are actually artificial spiritual roots!?</p>

    <p>In response to this, the expression on Sun Rong's face was one of astonishment.</p>

    <p>"In order to create this artificial spiritual root, I used many kinds of materials obtained from different secret realms to synthesize the spiritual root. I used different material formulas. Then, I used these different materials to create spiritual roots. Implanted into the bodies of some selected babies. And you are one of those children."</p>

    <p>The crazy woman was walking with her hands behind her back. She seemed to be talking to herself and said, "Later, I ordered people to disperse those children and seek out cultivator families for adoption. I wanted to see how long those children could live."</p>

    <p>Having said this. Liu Renfeng stopped.</p>

    <p>She turned around and looked at Sun Ying'er. She stretched out her sin-stained hand, pinched her chin and said, "The batch back then had a total of 462 children. And you... The only one who survived."</p>

    <p>Not only did Mrs. Fengchu feel no guilt at all about the things she had done back then, but she was also full of pride.</p>

    <p>She looked at Sun Ying'er and continued: "The science of cultivation is always accompanied by sacrifice. Now the spiritual root in your body is the correct artificial spiritual root formula. And when you use the materials to make your spiritual root. There is also a small part of it that is from the secret realm."</p>

    <p>"As long as the spiritual root in your body is taken out and analyzed again, the backdoor password to the secret realm can be easily deciphered..."</p>

    <p>"You know. What does this mean?"</p>

    <p>"This means that I can remove all the materials used to create artificial spiritual roots from that secret realm and become the first person in history in this field..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong involuntarily clenched his little fists.</p>

    <p>What kind of crazy bitch is this?</p>

    <p>She is simply a female devil!</p>

    <p>She continued like a devil: "Jiang Yingying. When I saw you back then, you were only as big as a cabbage. You were frail and sick. You would never live to be as old as you are now. It was my artificial spiritual root that saved you."</p>

    <p>"And now, it's time for you to repay me... isn't it?"</p>
