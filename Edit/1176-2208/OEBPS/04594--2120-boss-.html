  <h1>Chapter 2120 This Novice Village boss is so strong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What is it like to have a baby in the gaming world? Wang Ling had never experienced it before.</p>

    <p>Because of his sister Wang Nuan, Wang Ling is not too disgusted with raising children. In addition, Wang Muyu sticks to him all day long. Wang Ling just thinks of it as having an extra brother.</p>

    <p>However, it is okay to play with one or two children. If there are eighteen children, it will be enough to cause a headache.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally discovered it. He discovered that Bai Qiao's game actually had development elements.</p>

    <p>Isn't training these eighteen children in the General's Mansion just a nurturing game?</p>

    <p>It's just that these eighteen children now have different talents. There is also an eight-year-old who looks like a forty-eight-year-old.</p>

    <p>God knows what kind of strange species will appear in the future?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart. He felt the difficulty of this hidden task.</p>

    <p>There is no way. Now we can only take one step at a time...</p>

    <p>"Liu Jun." Under the mask of General Huwei, Wang Ling made a deep voice. Because of the mask, Wang Ling found that his voice had also changed. It was a particularly mature voice. It was completely different from his original voice. The childish feeling of a young person.</p>

    <p>He called Liu Jun and ordered him to bring back all the fifteen children remaining outside.</p>

    <p>"Here." Liu Jun bowed his hands and said respectfully. He didn't dare to disobey in the slightest.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Wang Ling rarely speaks to others in a commanding tone. The experience of this identity is certainly a different feeling. But for Wang Ling, there is still a slight feeling of discomfort.</p>

    <p>He is a well-known social phobic. He originally spoke very little. Now he is asked to play a role to scare others. It is inevitable that he is not used to it.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling feels that he does not have the talent to be an actor because he was born with facial paralysis. In an age where acting is becoming more and more important, just having a good-looking face is useless.</p>

    <p>And just having a good-looking face and good acting skills is not enough. If you are an idol actor and have emotional flaws, that is not enough.</p>

    <p>Even if there are no emotional flaws. When everything is perfect, it is useless not to pay taxes.</p>

    <p>Looking at Liu Jun's retreating back, Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh. There are people from all walks of life these days, and their works have collapsed one after another. Only his paralyzed face and his undying love for crispy noodles stand out. </p>

    <p>After a preliminary inspection of the talents of the three children in the General's Mansion, Wang Ling decided to customize a tailor-made exercise for these 18 children.</p>

    <p>It has to be a one-time thing for everyone here.</p>

    <p>This is a method that can consolidate one's spiritual roots. Children with high talents can solidify their own foundation after learning. Children with insufficient talents, or in other words, no talents, can reach normal average levels after learning.</p>

    <p>Such a skill simply does not exist in the eyes of outsiders. However, Wang Ling's spell reserve is so huge that it is far beyond the reach of anyone in the world.</p>

    <p>Finding the information you want among limited books is certainly not an easy task.</p>

    <p>But in the huge Heavenly Dao method library, it is very simple to find a method you want. What's more, Wang Ling is also a Heavenly Dao whitelist user, so it naturally has the ability to automatically search.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, under the leadership of the guards, Sun Rong finally arrived at the rumored General's Mansion in Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl had no idea that the general of General Welfare had been replaced by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She felt uneasy in her heart. Even though she had learned the sword technique, she still felt a little worried when facing an unknown enemy.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is very clear about the purpose of entering the game with Wang Ling. It is just to expand the power of Mr. Hidden Fox and facilitate future layout.</p>

    <p>But now she has not even left the Novice Village. Fuyun Town is a Novice Village.</p>

    <p>Time in the game always flies by so fast. Sun Rong doesn't even know how long it has taken since she entered the game. She feels like an endless amount of time has passed.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's game environment is too real. It gives people a real sense of being on the same place. It seems that everything is real. The environment, smell, light, and even the soundscape are all extremely realistic simulations.</p>

    <p>This has to make Sun Rong sincerely admire Bai Qiao. And the contributions of Wang Ming and Shou Chong, the think tanks behind Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you going to see the cell leader? Why did you come to the general?" Sun Rong asked in front of the general's mansion.</p>

    <p>"The cell leader is the general. The general is the cell leader!" What surprised Sun Rong was that the guard immediately snorted and replied to her.</p>

    <p>The guard is also one of the PCs in the game. For the settings involved in the game script, the game system will modify the settings in real time according to the plot development to achieve a more realistic effect.</p>

    <p>NPC with dual identities?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little surprised. I didn't expect that the first novice mission boss I might face in this small novice village would already be so fierce. He also has a dual identity and is so powerful.</p>

    <p>Her heart was beating fast. She followed the guard in front of her and walked in slowly, dragging her heavy armor.</p>

    <p>This general's uniform is very majestic and vast. It is almost the most luxurious building in the entire Fuyun Town. Just from the first look at Sun Rong, you can tell that this Fuyun Town general must be a wealthy gentleman.</p>

    <p>Only if you are also a gentry, you will have a certain sensitivity to the same type of people. Sun Rong grew up in a wealthy family, and more or less has the ability to identify antiquities. Judging from the patterns on the carved beams and painted buildings of the General's Mansion, she I already know it in my heart.</p>

    <p>Then very quickly, she was brought into the courtyard, and the first thing she saw in the courtyard was a man wearing a mask of General Huwei who was teaching his sons.</p>

    <p>A total of eighteen children, almost all of different sizes and ages. Six of them were neatly arranged in three rows, forming a matrix. They were directly exposed to the sun to practice standing postures.</p>

    <p>This scene gave Sun Rong an extremely familiar feeling. She didn't know why. She felt like this was military training...</p>

    <p>She stared at the "Fuyun Town General" who was training her sons in front of her with a slightly absent-minded gaze. www.uukanshu.netSun Rong did not dare to speak at all. She just felt that this general was also the prison chief. It seemed that he was not as good as she imagined. Scary. And it feels very familiar.</p>

    <p>And it even gave her an illusion.</p>

    <p>I thought it was the man I was familiar with.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, listening to the majestic voice of the Fuyun Town general, Sun Rong quickly woke up.</p>

    <p>The game world is so big. How could she meet Wang Ling in Novice Village?</p>

    <p>While he was smiling bitterly in his heart, Sun Rong suddenly found that the general's eyes met his own through the mask. But it was only for a moment. The cold and majestic Fuyun Town general removed his eyes. sight.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that because the mask changed his voice, Sun Rong didn't recognize him at first glance.</p>

    <p>But he recognized her...</p>
