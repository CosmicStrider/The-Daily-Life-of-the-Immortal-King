  <h1>Chapter 1958 The first confrontation with Qu Shuling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment, the setting sun in the Number 2 Trial Ground is like blood. The smoke after the collision of magic weapons fills the air. It is like a long smoke dragon traversing the entire Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that a war would start in advance before the sect competition. Almost everyone on every peak suffered losses in this battle.</p>

    <p>All fights are closely monitored by the Jiutian Jingmi Institute using sophisticated cultivation science instruments. According to the protection mechanism of the Number 2 Proving Ground, as long as they encounter fatal injuries, or are likely to cause disabling injuries such as missing arms and legs.</p>

    <p>The protection mechanism of the trial field will be activated immediately. A protective shield will be formed around the person being attacked. The person will then be forcibly removed from the field.</p>

    <p>Only those in the trial field have scripts. Actors playing various NPCs can automatically return later. If they are students participating in the trial, once they are attacked by such fatal injuries or disabling injuries in advance, it means elimination.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao fought heartily. These two were too tough. Because of this mechanism, they felt that this was a game even more.</p>

    <p>And the attacks are more vicious. Because there is no need to consider the issue of retaining strength. You only need to attack with all your strength.</p>

    <p>After all, as long as the system determines that their attack is fatal or disabling, the opponent will be forced to leave the field.</p>

    <p>After mastering this trick, the two of them didn't care at all when fighting.</p>

    <p>"Damn it. You are so shameless! Why do you attack other people's vital parts..."</p>

    <p>Several NPCs in Wuxiang Peak have returned after being killed by Chen Chao and Guo Hao for the Nth time.</p>

    <p>They couldn't complain about their precise "Nine Yin White Bone Claws." Thanks to this protective cover, otherwise, with their accuracy, all the men here would be beaten.</p>

    <p>And although this trick seems simple, it is actually not easy to learn. After all, it requires precision and is not easy to imitate.</p>

    <p>This is attributed to the normal behavior of boys joking with each other in school, especially during recess. This kind of operation Wang Ling is familiar with has become almost commonplace.</p>

    <p>There are only a few people who can understand the skills from this playful behavior.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Chen Chao and Guo Hao are also geniuses.</p>

    <p>"A soldier never tires of deceit. As long as it works. And this shouldn't be considered a game bug."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao responded with a smile: "You really have to go to the battlefield. To fight for your life. But you can use any tricks!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, several male NPC actors rolled their eyes and left the stage. They originally wanted to use Chen Chao and Guo Hao's trick.</p>

    <p>But who knew that the two of them guarded their vital parts extremely strictly.</p>

    <p>"Unexpectedly. This is the iron crotch skill we practiced in school to prevent this kind of situation! I have already practiced it to the tenth level!" Guo Hao laughed confidently.</p>

    <p>"..." Everyone was shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>What did these two people learn in school?</p>

    <p>In comparison, Wang Ling's situation was not very smooth.</p>

    <p>His Talisman had just been replaced not long ago. Unexpectedly, it was time to replace it with a new Talisman. Now the Talisman is indeed wearing out faster than before.</p>

    <p>At first, it was changed once a year. Then it was changed every six months. Now it is changed every month.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that maybe it will have to change every Monday from now on... Unless Wang Ming can analyze the material in the black stone called "Eternity" and create a new type of Talisman. Otherwise, he and the earth will be in danger at any time.</p>

    <p>Over there, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan were working hard to collect Cuishan jade. At this moment, a familiar breath suddenly came from a distance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly had trouble in his heart.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, in this situation, things were going uphill again and again. It happened to be at a critical point when Talisman was unstable.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling noticed the situation on the mountain behind them.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough. You are here."</p>

    <p>He came with a spiritual sword on his feet. He was wearing a Wuxiang Peak suit. He looked like a social elite. Under this image, the young man's tone had a mature flavor.</p>

    <p>As a star student at the top ranked university in Songhai City, Qu Shuling's aura is indeed stronger than all the high school students Wang Ling has seen before. At the same time, his self-confidence is also innate. Standing on the spiritual sword and looking around. He didn't take anyone seriously at all.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, we have no intention of fighting. Are you here to cause trouble? And although we are in different sects, the final settlement is based on the cultivation country as a unit." Li Changzhe said. He carefully protected the Cuishan Jade in his hand.</p>

    <p>"As long as I'm here, they can't surpass them together."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling said, looking at the three people below coldly: "So you are also dispensable. None of you can take away the resources here at Wuxiang Peak."</p>

    <p>Hearing Qu Shuling say this, Wang Ling knew in his heart that this battle was inevitable.</p>

    <p>He experienced what happened at the Number 1 Proving Ground last time. Qu Shuling was trying to be brave and walked alone. In the end, he was sent back to the oasis because of the failure of the mission, kowtowed directly in front of Wang Ling and then fell into coma. It is still vivid in his mind.</p>

    <p>So this time, Qu Shuling actually came for revenge.</p>

    <p>And the tone was very strong.</p>

    <p>This makes people uncomfortable to hear.</p>

    <p>Before Zhang Linyan could speak, Li Changzhe could no longer hold back his chatter. He immediately crossed his arms and looked at him: "Brother Qu, you and our school are allies. I have always respected you. But what you just said was a bit too much. You are a genius. But the three of us are also the top students in each school. Are you going to fight three of us?"</p>

    <p>One against three.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling does have the strength and the courage.</p>

    <p>It's just that Li Changzhe never thought they would reach this point.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because Qu Shuling clearly knows that the videos in the trial field will not be released to the public. The feeling he gives people here is completely different from the sense of intimacy in the real world. It's like he has changed into a different person.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe had felt that Qu Shuling wore several masks on his face. But he never expected that the other party would directly take off his mask in this situation. And he would leave no room for it.</p>

    <p>"I just want to prove my strength. For me, this is a perfect opportunity."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling's expression was cold. The next second he took action immediately. Without saying a word, he started fighting directly.</p>

    <p>And the first target targeted was Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment Qu Shuling set out, Zhang Linyan also reacted and immediately summoned her bow and arrow. However, little did she know that Qu Shuling had even predicted her bow summoning action in advance. At the instant of her arrival, with an ordinary pick, the bow and arrow fell off Zhang Linyan's hand.</p>

    <p>He was not polite. After picking up the sword, he struck Zhang Linyan in the lower abdomen with a tight-fitting whip. Even though Zhang Linyan had already reacted and used her arms to resist, the force of the whip was still too strong.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling had no idea of pity for her. He whipped Zhang Linyan away on the spot and broke the big tree in the distance.</p>

    <p>"Hit women as soon as you strike. You are really a masculine man!" Li Changzhe couldn't help it when he saw this and started scolding him.</p>

    <p>Although from the perspective of offensive thinking, it is indeed a good way to preemptively contain opponents who attack from a distance. But the merciless blow from Qu Shuling just now made Li Changzhe know that this person is serious and has no hold back at all.</p>

    <p>He also summoned the spirit sword and tested it with Qu Shuling for several rounds. Then he was also shaken back by Qu Shuling's overwhelming force.</p>

    <p>"That's it."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling couldn't help but show a somewhat disappointed look on his face.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect three against one. The first test had already beaten Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan to the point where they were unable to fight back.</p>

    <p>Now, there is only one last person left who has not been tested yet.</p>

    <p>The next second, he turned to look at Wang Ling and tried to predict Wang Ling's next move...</p>
