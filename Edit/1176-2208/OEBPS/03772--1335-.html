  <h1>Chapter 1335 The strengthened monk</h1>

  <div>

    <p>An unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>The monk is still in tourist observation mode...</p>

    <p>"As expected of Dao Ancestor Wang. He is able to maintain such a complex core world for a long time!"</p>

    <p>The monk kept talking about his thoughts after watching: "It seems that Dao Ancestor uses laws to build a complete ecological system. The laws can support each other, so that the core world can be moved out of the body without destroying it. To the point of collapse..."</p>

    <p>He was intoxicated in this magical and unspeakable world.</p>

    <p>He tilted his head. I wanted to ask Wang Ling for his opinion.</p>

    <p>As a result, when I turned around, I found that the right eye of Wang Ling behind me started to bleed...</p>

    <p>The blood flowed very horribly. It was like free blood plasma gushing out of the eye sockets in a horror movie.</p>

    <p>Why did you get hurt all of a sudden when you had nothing to worry about?</p>

    <p>This shocked the monk for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. You..."</p>

    <p>But the monk is so discerning. He quickly realized: "No...you are not Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>"Haha. As expected of senior Jin and others. A person who can take ten slaps from his master. He is really powerful."</p>

    <p>"That's right! The poor monk is also the only one who survived Ling Zhenren's ten palms!" The monk was extremely proud.</p>

    <p>He looked at the person in front of him who was temporarily using Wang Ling's body to speak. He narrowed his eyes and said, "Are you Ling Zhenren's real clone?"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord gave a bitter smile. He couldn't help but slumped down: "Yes... If the Lord doesn't replace me, I really don't know what to do."</p>

    <p>This is the interaction mechanism between the "real avatar" and the "ontology."</p>

    <p>Soul switching can be performed at critical moments.</p>

    <p>It's just that this kind of soul switching is limited by distance...</p>

    <p>The distance between this earth and this unspeakable place is too long! It almost spans an extraterrestrial galaxy!</p>

    <p>Such a long distance. Let alone 5G signal. 10086G is useless...</p>

    <p>Even if the monk himself uses a "real clone", it is impossible for him to do it.</p>

    <p>As a result, the monk's respect for Wang Ling rose to several levels.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren! Forever a god!"</p>

    <p>At the same time, the monk marveled at the power of the Lord of the Void in his prime state.</p>

    <p>Even Crispy Noodles Dao Lord was taught such a lesson...</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that he was more interested in the "Unspeakable Place" now.</p>

    <p>Even the monk himself wanted to compete with the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>But soon, the monk thought of a very serious matter: "That's not right, Lord Dao! Once Ling Zhenren leaves... what will we do about the destruction of the Unspeakable Land?"</p>

    <p>"I'll leave it to you."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said: "I am injured now. It is obviously impossible to fight."</p>

    <p>"A poor monk, destroying an unspeakable place?"</p>

    <p>Without Wang Ling around, the monk began to have some doubts about his abilities...</p>

    <p>This is the outer core world built by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>With his current palm power, although he won't be trapped here, there may still be some problems in taking away the entire unspeakable place...</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Master left me a 100% enlightenment spell."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord stretched out his hand and touched the monk's forehead.</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>The place was suddenly filled with golden light!</p>

    <p>The monk's whole body burst into bright light instantly!</p>

    <p>Monk: "This is!!!"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord: "What are you still doing? You've been strengthened. Come on!"</p>

    <p>"Then... poor monk, give it a try!"</p>

    <p>Although he has not completely finished sightseeing, the monk really wants to try it now. After being "strengthened", how far has his palm power been improved?</p>

    <p>What palm technique is best to use...</p>

    <p>Just use the newly learned {Past Burning Ancient Buddha Palm}!</p>

    <p>As a result, the monk's anger sank into his Dantian, and he aimed a palm directly in front of him.</p>

    <p>Buzz, rumble, rumble...</p>

    <p>This was a tentative palm. The monk deliberately did not release the full power.</p>

    <p>However, because it is in a "strengthened" state, the destructive power caused by this palm.</p>

    <p>It was still beyond the monk's imagination...it obviously only used less than 10% of the palm force.</p>

    <p>As a result, this palm and palm print filled the entire world of the Unspeakable Land!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The clouds are steaming and the clouds are shining. The Buddha's light is soaring into the sky. The palm prints of the ancient Buddha's palms are like the bright sun. It bursts out with terrible power! Push forward with a sweeping attitude!</p>

    <p>In one breath, the entire unspeakable land fell into a state of collapse on the spot. Everything was being destroyed!</p>

    <p>The monk's palm started from the shoreline and pushed to the core temple where the original Heavenly Dao was located!</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on..." The original Heavenly Dao was extremely horrified.</p>

    <p>He had just put on his armor and planned to go to the coast to fight the monk.</p>

    <p>The results haven't started yet.</p>

    <p>It collapsed that day.</p>

    <p>It's already coming!</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>In an instant, the temple collapsed. Countless evil Heavenly DaoGolden Men were destroyed by the monk's palm!</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao is under attack from the front.</p>

    <p>The armor all over his body suddenly shattered.</p>

    <p>The palm power containing huge energy evaporated his body.</p>

    <p>It only takes a few microseconds.</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao's entire body had been burned into a shriveled golden skin. It was too miserable to look at.</p>

    <p>With this palm strike, there was too much movement.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that the original Heavenly Dao and the evil Heavenly DaoGolden Men didn't react.</p>

    <p>Even the monk himself was shocked.</p>

    <p>This...this is the palm power that he can produce at this level?</p>

    <p>The monk couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren's enlightenment technique is too powerful. It is beyond the scope of the monk's understanding.</p>

    <p>"The master's enlightenment technique resonates with your consecration technique, so once it is used on you, the power will increase dramatically. It is ten times more powerful than if it is used on other people."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said: "And..."</p>

    <p>"And what?"</p>

    <p>"Everything you have illuminated before will have a huge increase in power in a short period of time."</p>

    <p>"That's it..." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>To capture the thief, capture the king first.</p>

    <p>With this palm strike, the Unspeakable Land was not completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, the original Heavenly Dao was directly destroyed by a strange combination of circumstances.</p>

    <p>But what makes Crispy Noodles Dao Lord very strange is.</p>

    <p>It seems that the soul of the original Heavenly Dao is still there. It has not been completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>"Master Dao doesn't know something. My {Past Burning Ancient Buddha Palm} is also called {Past Repentance Palm}. The souls of those who hold it are trapped in the illusion of Buddhism. Only by repentance can the soul be liberated."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Otherwise they will always be immersed in the illusion of reincarnation where they are killed..."</p>

    <p>"But I don't think they will repent." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord laughed.</p>

    <p>"So, they will never have peace." The monk said as he performed a Buddhist salute.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the hinterland of the Office of Strategic Deception, facing Crispy Noodles Dao Lord who suddenly stood up under strong pressure.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was puzzled.</p>

    <p>But now she is no longer interested in Crispy Noodles Dao Lord kneeling down.</p>

    <p>"It's more important to take away Rongrong as soon as possible!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er frowned and turned his gaze to the sky.</p>

    <p>She had predicted it before.</p>

    <p>This is the final blow!</p>

    <p>The Void Gate has completed its energy storage.</p>

    <p>The huge void gate will be transformed into a cannon barrel at this moment, making a devastating impact on the earth!</p>

    <p>No matter what happened to Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, everything in front of him was beyond repair.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Just a moment!</p>

    <p>A blazing beam of light descended from the sky!</p>

    <p>The void world-destroying cannon has arrived!</p>

    <p>But at this moment.</p>

    <p>Once again, an unexpected scene appeared for Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>In the True Venerated Immortal Hall of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>A petite figure actually waved the wings on its back and rushed towards the terrifying light of destruction!</p>

    <p>King of the Divine Realm?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er would never have imagined that the King of the Divine Realm would take action at this moment to resist her Void World-Destroying Cannon.</p>

    <p>"Why do you have to do this for these people on earth..." Sun Ying'er couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>In her eyes.</p>

    <p>An underdeveloped divine realm king.</p>

    <p>In the face of the huge power of the void world-destroying cannon.</p>

    <p>But he is just a cannon fodder.</p>

    <p>In the sky, the feathers of light from the divine realm are falling, like angels descending into the world, exuding holy light.</p>

    <p>Girl Ajuan resisted the pressure and flew higher and higher!</p>

    <p>Under tremendous pressure, the King of the Divine Realm was shocked and bleeding.</p>

    <p>The flying snowflakes splashed in all directions and fell on the magic weapon in her hand.</p>

    <p>And it wasn't until this moment that Sun Ying'er discovered that this God Realm King seemed to be holding something in his hand...</p>

    <p>She rubbed her eyes.</p>

    <p>Make sure you read it correctly.</p>

    <p>This is actually a mobile phone stained with the blood of Ajuan Girl Realm King...</p>

    <p>At this time, Miss Ajuan left facing the terrifying light of void destruction!</p>

    <p>"When the yin and yang reverse, the sky will be dyed with my blood!"</p>

    <p>She screamed loudly with a milky voice. She held her phone high and waved her wings, showing off her elegance as the King of the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>He actually used his own mobile phone film.</p>

    <p>Push back all the world-destroying light of the void...</p>
