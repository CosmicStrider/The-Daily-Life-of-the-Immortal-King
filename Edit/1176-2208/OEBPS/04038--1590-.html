  <h1>Chapter 1590 Eyeball's last words</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As one of the most powerful outer gods in the Old Dominator, Eyeball is extremely confident in his speed. In terms of speed, he believes that there is no opponent in the world who can match him.</p>

    <p>The civilization of the ancient universe has been annihilated for too long. At that time, they were the leading overlord creatures in the universe.</p>

    <p>As for the human cultivators that were derived later, in the eyes of the Old Dominator, they are nothing more than feed that can provide nutrients.</p>

    <p>"hiahia..."</p>

    <p>However, to the eyeball's surprise, Wang Nuan actually laughed at this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also startled by this sudden laughter.</p>

    <p>He suddenly realized that Ah Nuan girl was completely different from himself.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he had discovered it earlier...this girl's expressions and emotions were much richer than his own.</p>

    <p>"Little guy. How dare you laugh at me." The eyeball glanced at Wang Nuan. It glared at Wang Ling with a kind of contempt.</p>

    <p>At the same time, there is a bit of compassion.</p>

    <p>As human cultivators, there are actually very few people who can get through this level. In the eyes of the eye, it is not easy for Wang Ling and Wang Nuan to safely get through the dead forest in front of them.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of human cultivators, these brothers and sisters are definitely at the top of the food chain.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that they are about to be buried here.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there was pity and sadness in its eyes. It looked directly at Wang Ling and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>I sneered in my heart.</p>

    <p>Just laugh...just laugh...</p>

    <p>It will be your brother and sister's turn to cry soon.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling agreed to conduct the "speed attribute" appraisal.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>It was the same as the previous scene in the dead forest. A six-sided dice appeared in the void.</p>

    <p>The attributes of this level are based on the "speed attribute" of the eyeball.</p>

    <p>In other words, the speed attribute of Wang Ling must exceed the speed attribute of the eyeball.</p>

    <p>The six-sided dice appearing in the air now is actually the [Golden Magic Block] effect obtained by Wang Ling before.</p>

    <p>This is a double-edged sword.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling is very likely to be thrown to blank.</p>

    <p>But in fact, even if the blank eyeball is not thrown, there will be no fear at all.</p>

    <p>It waits quietly for the results.</p>

    <p>Until the Golden Cube's dice face was set at 3 points. It suddenly laughed: "Kid. Three times the attribute bonus. Your luck is not bad. But... Heh heh heh heh..."</p>

    <p>It smiled very slyly.</p>

    <p>Three times.</p>

    <p>It acknowledges that Wang Ling was indeed lucky.</p>

    <p>But so what if it's three times?</p>

    <p>Its attribute is +∞!</p>

    <p>You are a cultivator on earth. Even if I give you ten times! Eighteen times! Thirty times! Can you beat me in seconds?</p>

    <p>Eyeball doesn't believe this evil at all.</p>

    <p>It sneered.</p>

    <p>Soon, the golden light in the void began to announce the results of the eyeball speed assessment.</p>

    <p>Is a "+∞" symbol.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not surprised by this.</p>

    <p>He actually knew that Eyeball dared to bet on him. He must have strong self-confidence.</p>

    <p>At this time, Eyeball laughed again: "Boy, I didn't expect that... you will never be able to surpass me from the beginning. You two brothers and sisters should be able to provide me with good nutrition."</p>

    <p>Just as he finished speaking, the speed attribute announcement result of Wang Ling appeared.</p>

    <p>The identification result of Wang Ling:﹢∞﹢∞﹢∞﹢∞...</p>

    <p>Because it will have three times more attributes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, in addition to the speed attribute, there are three additional "﹢∞" symbols.</p>

    <p>In the void. A huge golden talisman. The dog's eyes were blinded on the spot.</p>

    <p>Eyeball took a breath: "Ah this..."</p>

    <p>Such identification results are hard for the eyes to accept.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Its pupils contracted. Bloodshot eyes gushed out. It was as red as blood. It emitted a light that distorted the void.</p>

    <p>It couldn't believe that a lowly creature from Earth could far surpass it in terms of speed.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity.</p>

    <p>It only looked handsome for three seconds. A line of golden ancient characters appeared in the void. It was shining brightly, with some kind of overwhelming pressure. Then there was a bang. A punishment spear landed directly. Like a spear. From the sky Cross it!</p>

    <p>An overwhelming blow!</p>

    <p>Under such pressure, the speed that the eyeball is proud of failed. It kept changing its position. However, this spear had already locked onto it, with some kind of tracking power.</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Black blood spattered everywhere. The eyeball was pierced by a spear. The eyelid exploded on the spot. It was like a pierced watermelon.</p>

    <p>Then it quickly began to annihilate. Along with the swampland under its feet, it turned into a pile of powder and dissipated into the small world...</p>

    <p>Where the eye disappeared. A black hole was left behind. Wang Ling could clearly hear the eyeball's resentful voice from inside: "Sotos... You wanted to kill me long ago... But you let me be humiliated like this ...You will definitely get your retribution and punishment..."</p>

    <p>As the last words of the eyeball fell, the golden light of punishment disappeared in the void. Peace returned to the small world again. The swamps were gone, and the reeds were gone.</p>

    <p>And before Wang Ling are three brand new doors.</p>

    <p>The words he said before his eyes left have been lingering in Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>This palace of the outer gods seems indeed unusual to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Since the other party wants to kill him...</p>

    <p>Then it is completely possible to cheat. Let him lose the game forcibly.</p>

    <p>But now judging from the results. Wang Ling feels that there may be a deeper and more complicated reason behind this.</p>

    <p>The origins of these Old Dominators, who are imprisoned in the palaces of the outer gods and act as gatekeepers, are all extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Although his eyeballs are weak, he was once a powerful outsider.</p>

    <p>But why did they fall to this point...</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling thinks of something.</p>

    <p>That's Dao Ancestor Wang's Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>He felt that this approach was similar to Dao Ancestor Wang's method of forcibly sealing those Eternal Powerhouses who couldn't stand it in the Supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling called Zhang Zhui in his heart.</p>

    <p>Now the supreme Corpse Map is in the hands of Wang Ling. And Wang Ling also used the method of changing the law to change the owner of the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>In other words. Wang Ling is now the owner of this supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>When he first saw Zhang Zhui seeing his King's Eyes, he looked thoughtful.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just remembered it now. This Zhang Zhui might know something about the civilization of the ancient universe.</p>

    <p>The experience and knowledge accumulated by the powerful through the ages is very terrifying.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui has his own vast knowledge.</p>

    <p>"You finally remembered me..."</p>

    <p>Hearing Wang Ling's call, Zhang Zhui immediately sighed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, King's Eyes and Corpse Map had a spiritual link.</p>

    <p>Only Zhang Zhui in the picture saw what was happening outside.</p>

    <p>The sight in front of him made Zhang Zhui frown slightly: "This...how do I look at it? It looks a bit like the palace of the outer gods?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded noncommittally.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui heard this, his hair stood on end: "Why are you so brave? This is a place where there is no return!"</p>

    <p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, he realized that the situation in front of him did not seem to be what he thought.</p>

    <p>As far as he knew, entering the palace of the outer gods would lead to death.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>Isn't this young man standing here perfectly?</p>

    <p>He also brought a baby girl lying on his shoulder, as soft as a ball of glutinous rice...</p>

    <p>Immediately, Zhang Zhui took a breath of cold air.</p>

    <p>He felt.</p>

    <p>I seem to have underestimated Wang Ling a little bit...</p>
