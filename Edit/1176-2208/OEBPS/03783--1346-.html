  <h1>Chapter 1346 Sun Rong Jealousy Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under the building of the cadre apartment. A luxurious red convertible supercar is parked here.</p>

    <p>The sports car was rented by Liu Qingyi using a black card from the Huaguo Shuilian Group. The cost of renting one was 2,000.</p>

    <p>She has spare money now. Naturally, she won't feel bad about this mere two thousand yuan.</p>

    <p>Since it's the tumor fish that makes Wang Zhen jealous.</p>

    <p>Now we have to take it one step at a time.</p>

    <p>No matter how much money he spends, Liu Qingyi will not feel bad.</p>

    <p>Of course, it's not enough to just go in and out...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was sitting in the driver's seat. He noticed that Liu Qingyi was chatting with someone.</p>

    <p>The woman typed extremely fast.</p>

    <p>He didn't know where I learned the lightning fingering technique. The tapping speed is comparable to that of Fujitaka.</p>

    <p>"I'm chatting with my classmate Sun Rong." Liu Qingyi said while typing.</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about?" Gu Shunzhi was curious.</p>

    <p>"You are pretending to be my boyfriend today. And my purpose is to cure Wang Zhen. So I can just teach jealousy. I estimate that Jin will spend a lot of money. You can't just go in and out!" Liu Qingyi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi clicked his tongue. He felt that the woman in front of him was indeed the same as his father. She was a calculating guy!</p>

    <p>Never let yourself suffer!</p>

    <p>"Aren't you? Don't you accept money?" Gu Shunzhi asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's free in name. This is selling a favor to sister Sun Rong. In order to return the favor, sister Sun Rong will definitely give me a red envelope. In this way, I have done the favor, and Sun Rong has done it with my classmates. The relationship with Sun Rong has improved. At the same time, receiving the red envelope will not make classmate Sun Rong feel uncomfortable." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was amazed when he heard this.</p>

    <p>His mother's skill was so clever that it was beyond his reach.</p>

    <p>"Come to think of it. Is there really friendship between girls?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi started the sports car and asked a very curious question.</p>

    <p>In fact, I also want to hear "Mom's" opinion.</p>

    <p>Although pretending to be a "boyfriend" is embarrassing.</p>

    <p>But this is also an opportunity to get to know my mother better.</p>

    <p>"Of course there are."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi replied while typing: "The premise is that the boyfriend is not the same. Otherwise, even if they are best friends, they can fall out if they fall out."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Where are we going?"</p>

    <p>"The Changyang Xiuzhen Aquarium in the city center." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>"Why go there?"</p>

    <p>"Wei Zhi introduced Wang Zhen to a part-time job. It's right there. It's a little bit harder, but the salary is high. Since I want him to be jealous, of course I have to hang out in front of him."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi thought about the scene in her mind: "Just think about it. A man is working hard in the aquarium. Then at this moment, the girl who attracted his heart suddenly walks back and forth intimately in front of his eyes with a white face..."</p>

    <p>"So I...I am a white-faced person?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a metaphor, brother. Don't mind it so much."</p>

    <p>Liu...</p>

    <p>Qingyi smiled and said: "When you think about it like this, do you feel like you are burning with anger?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed Ying" Gu Shunzhi nodded: "You haven't thought about it. What if I get beaten by him?"</p>

    <p>"Come on. Can he beat you?" Liu Qingyi smiled.</p>

    <p>"So... have you settled all this?" Gu Shunzhi smiled helplessly.</p>

    <p>"I have been planning it since I came back from the Jiulongshan competition."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi sighed again.</p>

    <p>A woman's heart is like a needle in the sea!</p>

    <p>His mummy. It's terrible!</p>

    <p>But this matter, from his own point of view, Gu Shunzhi is definitely going to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>Otherwise he would have to run away with another man!</p>

    <p>And what if his mother ran away with another man!</p>

    <p>Not only is his mother gone, but he himself is gone too!</p>

    <p>The above sentences sound a bit like swearing...</p>

    <p>But it was definitely Gu Shunzhi's call from the bottom of his heart: Cang! Save the child!</p>

    <p>When the sports car is halfway through.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi asked another magical question: "Have you ever thought about what if your action overturns?"</p>

    <p>"My plan is very detailed. It is impossible to overturn." Liu Qingyi kept smiling.</p>

    <p>She is very confident in her "Sweet and Sour Carp Plan."</p>

    <p>But in fact, what Liu Qingyi didn't know was.</p>

    <p>In the aquarium. There is a "surprise" waiting for her...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time goes back a few hours ago.</p>

    <p>In the early morning, Wang Zhen received a text message from Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>It says Liu Qingyi's "Sweet and Sour Carp Plan."</p>

    <p>"Are you planning to pretend to be your boyfriend to make me jealous..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen stared at the message from Gu Shunzhi. The corners of his mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>Such behavior is tantamount to wanting to anger him and induce him to confess first!</p>

    <p>Oh!</p>

    <p>What a "vicious" plan!</p>

    <p>"Good brother! Thank you for telling me all this!" Wang Zhen sent a text message to Gu Shunzhi to thank him.</p>

    <p>Then quickly delete all chat records.</p>

    <p>It would definitely be wrong to let Liu Qingyi fire unilaterally</p>

    <p>So Wang Zhen made a decision - take this opportunity to counterattack!</p>

    <p>You can find someone to pretend to be your boyfriend.</p>

    <p>Then I can also find someone to pretend to be my girlfriend!</p>

    <p>Let's see who can't stand it first!</p>

    <p>Then, a brand new plan was born from the bottom of Wang Zhen's heart...</p>

    <p>Of course. The prerequisite for the implementation of this plan is.</p>

    <p>He must find someone willing to pretend to be his girlfriend.</p>

    <p>This put Wang Zhen in distress for a while.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have many close friends of the opposite sex... Many girls from Number 60 High School are interested in him. They even write him love letters! Wang Zhen read a few of them. They were so disgusting!</p>

    <p>Ask these girls for help. They will naturally agree.</p>

    <p>But Wang Zhen was really afraid. It would be bad if these children took it for real and acted like a fake!...</p>

    <p>By then, not only would Liu Qingyi not be caught, he would also be charged with playing with emotions.</p>

    <p>Think left and right.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen thought of a very suitable candidate.</p>

    <p>But it's not easy to invite this person...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen used his lifelong literary skills to think hard about the wording.</p>

    <p>I sent a text message to my favorite person...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>6 a.m.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen went out to work pretending to have nothing to do.</p>

    <p>This was the job Wei Zhi introduced to him after he came back from Jiulongshan. He heard that he was short of money.</p>

    <p>Mainly as a breeder feeding the animals.</p>

    <p>Because spiritual beasts have a certain wildness. If it weren't for Wang Zhen's rough skin and thick flesh, which resists bites, he might not have been chosen.</p>

    <p>The reporting time was actually at 9 o'clock.</p>

    <p>But before that, Wang Zhen needs to meet someone first.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's noodle shop Zheng</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang Xing! My happiness! I leave it to you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen knelt down and bowed his head sincerely.</p>

    <p>"Your story sounds very interesting. It's not that I don't want to help. It's just a matter of time. I don't accept large-scale contact."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Fang. I won't accept it either... I'm just pretending. At most, I can borrow a seat!"</p>

    <p>"Let me borrow my seat. Which school?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled: "Miss Liu has never seen me look feminine. As long as I dress up a little, she won't be able to recognize it. It's just..."</p>

    <p>Just this busy.</p>

    <p>He can't help in vain.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen is really not an idiot. He immediately understood what Fang Xing meant: "Whatever Mr. Fang wants, as long as I can do it, I can do it!"</p>

    <p>"I'm not busy here. Let me ask you a question first."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing asked: "I heard that many people thoughtfully sent us USB drives in order to help Miss Sun recover her memory?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen answered firmly.</p>

    <p>"Don't be so nervous. It doesn't matter if you send it. It is a general trend for Miss Sun to become a core member of the Office of Strategic Deception. If anyone wants to send a USB flash drive, just send it. What I care about is whether classmate Sun Rong is really like that I like classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>At this time, Fang Xing held his chin and said.</p>

    <p>Testing Sun Rong's attitude was something he had always planned.</p>

    <p>He felt that now was a particularly good opportunity.</p>

    <p>"What does Brother Fang mean?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that Brother Wang Zhen is actually very popular at Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>"This...is okay..."</p>

    <p>"No need to be modest. Brother Wang Zhen."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled: "The favor I want you to do is actually just a matter of raising your hand. I want you to send the girls love letters to you, transferred to the home of Ling Zhenren and the desk! It's best to put a few copies in Sun Rong's desk as well.</p>

    <p>"But Brother Fang Xing can also do this..."</p>

    <p>"Boys' wording is different from girls' wording." Fang Xing revealed his troubles: "I often receive letters from some boys."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "???"</p>

    <p>Both men and women are welcome. As expected of classmate Fang Xing, who is known as the heartthrob...</p>

    <p>"But... can I do this?"</p>

    <p>However, Wang Zhen still had some concerns about Fang Xing's proposal.</p>

    <p>"Why not? Just change the name of the letter. After removing the real characters of Wang Zhen, it will be classmate Wang. Who knows whether it is written to you or to Wang Ling?" Fang Xing said.</p>

    <p>"I can ask. What's the purpose of doing this..." Wang Zhen didn't understand.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled: "I want to see if classmate Sun Rong. will be jealous."</p>

    <p>"Okay! Deal!" So Wang Zhen gritted his teeth and agreed.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the two men reached a consensus.</p>
