  <h1>Chapter 2077 Let my apprentice hit you once. Isn't that too much?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A great cultivator, Guoyuan Zun, personally came to mention someone. Yi Jianchuan had to give this face.</p>

    <p>Even though he has reached the Holy Realm now, in this modern world of cultivation, there are still mature rules, laws, laws and various social relationships.</p>

    <p>Many cultivation countries that operate in an orderly manner like large machines rely on these to form a tight peace grid.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the realm-only theory is not advisable. Yi Jianchuan knew it very well. After he reached the holy realm, his realm was even higher than that of many Yuan Zun from the cultivation country.</p>

    <p>But Yuan Zun is responsible for the orderly operation of the entire cultivation country. Their ideas are often superior to ordinary people. Being talented in cultivation does not mean that you can govern a huge cultivation country well. Let every monk You can enjoy a peaceful life comfortably in your own country. You have enough to eat and warm clothes. You are not troubled by poverty. You are also free from the pain of displacement due to war.</p>

    <p>If he takes action today, he will personally break the rule that has restricted this world for a long time.</p>

    <p>Those who secretly fear that the world will not be in chaos will directly use this as a topic to preach the principle of "the highest realm and combat power." By then, I am afraid that the entire world will be in chaos.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Yi Jianchuan knew it well and had to stop.</p>

    <p>Although he really wanted to kill Hong Siqi directly in front of him...</p>

    <p>This is a scum who betrayed the Huaxiu Country. Although he is a casual cultivator with no attachments, he directly gave up his nationality and joined the Mixiu Country in order to obtain a high loan.</p>

    <p>It is a personal choice to choose your own country of cultivation and nationality. But after reaching the top of Venerated Immortal, he actually chose to kill his own compatriots to sacrifice to heaven in order to build his reputation.</p>

    <p>Based on this alone, Yi Jianchuan had the reason to kill him directly.</p>

    <p>But now, with Mi Xiu Yuan Zun coming forward, it is impossible to kill him.</p>

    <p>"Mi Xiu Yuan Zun's face, I, Yi Jianchuan, naturally want to give it to you."</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand and snapped his fingers. The rising sea level dropped instantly. The waterspouts that rolled up from all corners also followed the Holy Sword of the Sea and divided into countless rainwaters that scattered thousands of miles around, forming a short rainstorm.</p>

    <p>"The Sword Master's kindness today. I have written it down." The voice of Master Mi Xiuyuan came through the void again.</p>

    <p>He had come forward. So he had already expected that Yi Jianchuan would never dare to strike like this.</p>

    <p>But this is not the end. This Hong Siqi is now considered a Mixiu Countryman. The huge debt he carries is just rhetoric. But in the final analysis, it is because he is a Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>After the earth is upgraded, any monk who transcends from True Immortal to a higher realm will be the target of competition and wooing by the major cultivation countries.</p>

    <p>In this world, some people are satisfied with material desires, some are addicted to beauty, some are obsessed with money, and some are obsessed with power.</p>

    <p>There are high-level cultivators as the envoys of the cultivating country. Just thinking about it makes people feel at ease.</p>

    <p>So today's Hong Siqi is really very important to Mixiu Country.</p>

    <p>"Hey...they are just a bunch of short-sighted ants after all."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu, Yue Lingwei, and Zhang Zhui sighed almost simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Because currently their country, Huaxiu, has no talent crisis at all...</p>

    <p>Not to mention anything else, just the Wang brother and sister are sitting there. Is there a safer cultivation country in the world than Huaxiu?</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Hong Siqi's life was saved because of Mi Xiu Yuan Zun's intervention. But he still came out with this tone.</p>

    <p>So, Yi Jianchuan directly communicated with Mi Xiu Yuan Zun through the air: "Let's do it. Mi Xiu Yuan Zun, I don't have to kill him today for your sake. But Hong Siqi offended me first after all. It shouldn't hurt to slap him and teach him a lesson, right?"</p>

    <p>"Of course a slap doesn't hurt. But Sword Master, you are already in the holy realm after all. If this slap continues, Hong Siqi's life or death will be uncertain."</p>

    <p>"Please rest assured, Mr. Mi Xiuyuan. Since I have promised not to take action, then naturally I will not take action."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he looked at Wang Muyu who was wrapped tightly in a water polo next to him.</p>

    <p>This water polo was originally intended to protect Wang Muyu from external harm.</p>

    <p>In fact, it also has the effect of blocking prying eyes. Among the people here, except for Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui, no outsider can see Wang Muyu's true appearance. Everyone only knows that the water polo next to the sword master is filled with water. It's his mysterious disciple.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Yi Jianchuan casually raised his fist in the air. He laughed and said, "Mi Xiu Yuan Zun, I won't take action. I will let my apprentice take action and slap him. Is this okay? My apprentice. But there is only Golden." It's just Core."</p>

    <p>"But Hong Siqi is Venerated Immortal. The disciple you just accepted is just a Golden Core after all. If this slap continues, won't it backfire?"</p>

    <p>"Please rest assured, Master Mi Xiuyuan, on this point. I just took the Holy Sword of the Sea move and haven't released the spirit seal yet. He can't use his spiritual power now. There will be no spiritual power backlash. But... So... With the physical strength of Venerated Immortal, I shouldn't be able to feel any pain."</p>

    <p>"puff!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui almost couldn't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing on the spot.</p>

    <p>Although it is true that the Sword Master does not know the true realm and combat power of Wang Muyu's younger brother, it would be outrageous to really let Wang Muyu slap him.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that this is a deliberate attempt to humiliate Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>You're a Venerated Immortal. How can you be beaten by Golden Core? And you're the one who killed the disciple... Not only did you not kill the person, but you also gave yourself a slap on the face. And this slap is scary. Yes, it will be recorded directly in the annals of history.</p>

    <p>It's simply outrageous!</p>

    <p>And in the modern world of cultivation. What spreads the fastest?</p>

    <p>Of course it's data information. It spreads the fastest!</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui did something bad.</p>

    <p>He used his impatient acting skills to start a show of pretending to be crazy in public: "Ah! That master in the void is so powerful. I can't hear what he is talking about...but it seems to be that he wants the disciples of the Sword Master to beat Hong Si." A strange slap?"</p>

    <p>These words are meant for those casual cultivators who cannot hear the encrypted conversations.</p>

    <p>Many people hear someone translate it and naturally believe it to be true.</p>

    <p>As soon as they heard that Golden Core was going to fight Venerated Immortal, many monks watching around them all took out their mobile phones. They were all screaming at each other and taking pictures.</p>

    <p>Today's mobile phones often have hundreds of millions of pixels. This scene will definitely become a classic.</p>

    <p>"Lord Yuan Zun..." Hong Siqi's eyes were almost crying. He knew very well the influence behind this.</p>

    <p>He made Golden Core beat him with Venerated Immortal. Isn't this a complete social death?</p>

    <p>As a result, his request for help did not receive any response from Misu Yuan Zun.</p>

    <p>Because he was worried about the influence between the two major cultivating countries, Yi Jianchuan did not choose to kill Hong Siqi when Mi XiuYuan Zun came forward. This was already a way to save face.</p>

    <p>After all, it was just as Yi Jianchuan said. After all, Hong Siqi did suffer a loss. You have to let others make amends for this face.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in Misu Yuan Zun's view, it is completely reasonable and reasonable to ask the disciples of the Sword Master to give him this slap.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. Please."</p>

    <p>So Mi XiuYuan Zun stopped trying to stop him and decided to return Yi Jianchuan's favor for not killing Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>It's a matter of courtesy.</p>

    <p>Hehehe...</p>

    <p>His apprentice. A Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Can you beat someone to death?</p>
