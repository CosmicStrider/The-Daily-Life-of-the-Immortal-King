  <h1>Chapter 2032 Demonic Disintegration Sword</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling found that he had underestimated the Sun family's wealth after all.</p>

    <p>Especially when Mr. Boss Sun came out of the cave with a sacred sword on his head and his head covered in blood. He even felt a little unbelievable in his heart.</p>

    <p>Sacred weapon-level artifacts to Wang Ling can be used easily. In the eyes of Wang Ling, there is nothing extraordinary. However, in the eyes of many ordinary cultivators, a sacred-level spiritual weapon is enough for them to fight over.</p>

    <p>But the founder of the Sun family actually used holy weapon-level spiritual energy to set up traps. Such wealth is really unimaginable.</p>

    <p>Although the foundation of this ancestral land is still far behind that of King's Pants. But looking at the history of human cultivators in ancient and modern times, it is really amazing that the Sun family has such a foundation. This is a truly rich country.</p>

    <p>Even if future generations don't have a job and rely on consuming this heritage, they can still live very well in the peaceful modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there are regulations in the Sun family's organizational training. All the Sun family's wealth in the ancestral land will always belong to the Sun family's descendants.</p>

    <p>The hidden meaning is that these wealth must be passed down intact. It does not mean that as long as you ascend to the position of head of the family, you can legally have the right to control these "ancestral inheritance."</p>

    <p>This is a very wise decision. It not only preserves the heritage of the family's ancestral land and can be passed down forever for future generations to learn from, but also avoids infighting and loss within the Sun family in order to obtain the inheritance of the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, after being inspired, people can move forward bravely and practice hard. If you are wise, you can only be rich for three generations. If you only rely on the inheritance of your ancestors, it will definitely not last long.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, the Sun family has a long history. This inspirational legacy from the ancestor of the Sun family has been well preserved.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Boss Sun, are you okay?" Immortal Toya saw Sun Yiyuan with a bloody head. He was so shocked that he broke out in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Sacred level plug. It's actually still alive...</p>

    <p>You are the serious senior who seeks death!</p>

    <p>"It's okay. It's just a minor injury. It's nothing to worry about." As before, Sun Yiyuan's face remained calm. He smiled lightly. Then he reached out and pulled out the holy sword from his head.</p>

    <p>The sacred sword did not pierce his head directly. It was just the tip of the sword that penetrated his scalp. And because of the density of Sun Yiyuan's body, he forcefully clamped the tip of the holy sword with his scalp.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan pulled out the holy sword. He took out a handkerchief and carefully wiped the blood on it. Immediately, he also showed a surprised look: "Huh? This is not the one recorded in the ancestral history. The demon disintegration sword was actually used by the ancestor to set traps."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said curiously: "Grandpa. Demonic Disintegration Sword? What is this?"</p>

    <p>"A holy sword that was used on ancient battlefields in the era of ancient cultivators. Rumor has it that a sect undoubtedly unsealed a secret realm full of evil spirits back then, causing those evil spirits to escape and cause cholera in the world."</p>

    <p>"These evil spirits have no entity. They will swallow up the negative emotions of cultivators and rely on those negative forces to strengthen themselves. Theoretically, as long as they live long enough, their strength can grow infinitely."</p>

    <p>"In the era of ancient cultivators, there were always endless battles with each other. However, during that time, in order to deal with a common foreign enemy, it was rare for the ancient cultivators to unite together."</p>

    <p>"They collectively called these evil spirits Heavenly Demons. They named it the Heavenly Demons Suppression War."</p>

    <p>"Later, I heard that it was the founder who took the lead in creating this demon disintegration sword and mass-produced it with the most powerful sects at the time. The demons would explode directly when stabbed by this holy sword. Hence the name. Demon. Disintegrate."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Rong and Immortal Toya nodded.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was thoughtful about this passage.</p>

    <p>The timeline of the world of cultivation can be divided into eternity, ancient times and modern times.</p>

    <p>Judging from Boss Sun's description, the ancestral history of the Sun family can be directly traced back to ancient times. However, Wang Ling believes that this timeline may be extended a little further.</p>

    <p>The possibility that the founder of the Sun family is an eternal being.</p>

    <p>It's not completely zero. Although most of those all-powerful Eternals back then were included in the Corpse Map by Dao Ancestor Wang for protection, some of them still escaped.</p>

    <p>Some of those who escaped did survive and thus became servants of the race that bugged him in the universe. However, it is not ruled out that some may have escaped to the earth and became the first batch of cultivators in history.</p>

    <p>After checking Sun Yiyuan's injuries, he found that the old man was indeed fine. Sun Rong's anxious heart was relieved: "Hey, Grandpa, you should think about it again. These two entrances are not the same. What should we do next? Do you remember how to get back?"</p>

    <p>"I'm getting older. I always make mistakes. But it's really strange. Logically speaking, it should be one of the two cave entrances." Sun Yiyuan stared at the two cave entrances where traps were laid, with a look of doubt on his face.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps Mr. Boss Sun remembered correctly. Is it possible that the trap has changed?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"Changing formations? There are many entrances to the cave. If we add a formation-changing mechanism, I'm afraid we will be trapped here for the rest of our lives."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan touched his chin: "But I'm sure. I remember correctly... it's one of the two cave entrances. It turns out there are traps."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed inwardly. He put his pants pockets in and walked calmly towards the third hole.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. It's dangerous! You're too reckless to go in like this!" Sun Yiyuan just shouted. But then he saw Sun Rong walking in closely with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the voice of Sun Rong came from the cave: "Grandpa, don't worry, come in. This place is open!"</p>

    <p>"It actually works? I am too old to remember it correctly?"</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan showed an incredible look on his face.</p>

    <p>After passing through the hole, he quickly looked at Wang Ling. He wanted to ask how Wang Ling knew which was the correct entrance.</p>

    <p>But when the words came to his lips, he had an epiphany!</p>

    <p>This is classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The legendary Number 60 High School mascot!</p>

    <p>Good luck has always existed!</p>

    <p>There seems to be nothing strange about this blind cat encountering a dead mouse.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but sigh: "As expected of classmate Wang Ling. Your luck is really great. This is what we cultivators often call immortal fate. On the road of cultivation, even if you have talent, It's not enough. Luck is also important. It's also part of strength."</p>

    <p>"And classmate Wang Ling is not only lucky. He is also brave! Even though he knew there might be dangerous traps in my cave, you still dare to walk there alone. Rongrong. You must learn more from classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong laughed: "Grandpa is right!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Immortal Toya discovered something new.</p>

    <p>He looked up at the sky. On the top stone wall, which was brightly illuminated by the eternal lamp in the Biyou Cave, there was a large mass of blood clearly visible...</p>
