  <h1>Chapter 1601 Enthusiastic Citizenãƒ»Li Xian</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The impact caused by the meteorite falling to the ground will be huge. Of course Li Xian also knows this.</p>

    <p>So in order to avoid affecting other innocent people, he needs to make accurate calculations.</p>

    <p>In addition to selecting a meteorite of suitable size from the vast universe, he also needs to accurately calculate the orbit, impact point and the friction the meteorite will endure after entering the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Only by doing the above can we ensure that the meteorite is rubbed to the right size before it breaks out of the atmosphere and falls.</p>

    <p>Of course. Li Xian also took double insurance on this.</p>

    <p>He placed a border with a radius of twenty meters around the gate of Jiugong's residence.</p>

    <p>The meteorite that falls later will fall accurately into the center of the barrier.</p>

    <p>The explosive impact generated will be blocked by the barrier.</p>

    <p>As the first Vanguard to be sent out on a mission, Li Xian thought he had behaved in a courteous and dignified manner. Li Xian thinks that his behavior is very polite and quality. It is very much in line with the core socialist values of cultivation .</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>When a huge explosion accompanied by a mushroom cloud rising toward the sky rose at the front door of Jiugong's house. The One-Eyed Samurai under Jiugong Xiushi and all the men in black who were following his instructions were shocked.</p>

    <p>"What's going on! Go and have a look!"</p>

    <p>"yes!"</p>

    <p>Two ninjas in black responded and immediately left.</p>

    <p>This sudden situation surprised One-Eyed Samurai.</p>

    <p>He clearly has control over the entire Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that problems would arise at this juncture.</p>

    <p>"Come here!"</p>

    <p>Frowning slightly, One-Eyed Samurai felt bad and grabbed Jiugong Xiushi's collar. He stared at him: "Say! What the hell are you doing!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi also felt inexplicable and confused about the situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>He couldn't even figure out the plan he had been planning for so long. But at the end of the plan... Duyan, who had been working by his side. Duyan, who was most loyal to him, actually betrayed him.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Duyan stared at him angrily. His pupils were filled with red bloodshot eyes. He looked like he was crazy.</p>

    <p>There are rumors that {Ghost Book} will devour the hearts of those it wants to fight for. Jiugong Xiushi didn't expect this to be true...</p>

    <p>"My mother treated you well... You can't do this to me..." Jiugong Xiushi's eyes were filled with tears. He was trembling with fear. Duyan was stronger than him. After losing Duyan. He was completely useless.</p>

    <p>"I have followed you all these years. I have endured hardship and stood hard work. I have already repaid Madam's kindness."</p>

    <p>Duyan sneered: "I won't kill you. This is my last kindness to you. But I have no intention of letting the rest of the Jiugong family go."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do? Kill the whole family? I can go to the police station..."</p>

    <p>"Do you have the guts to go to the police?"</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai smiled.</p>

    <p>He ignored Jiugong Xiushi's words at all.</p>

    <p>"The dirty things you asked me to do in the past. Taken together, it's enough for you to be sentenced to several decades."</p>

    <p>"Although I promised to let you live, I can't guarantee that your mental health will not be a problem."</p>

    <p>"A mentally ill man who is lame and miserable on the street. Do you think anyone will believe you?"</p>

    <p>Duyan said. Jiugong Xiushi is also trembling.</p>

    <p>Indeed, this Duyan dragon hit the nail on the head, leaving him with almost no room for refutation.</p>

    <p>"You know. Why do I recommend that you live in seclusion and hide in this courtyard all year round?" Duyan said: "You think you are in control of the overall situation. But in fact, it is just my strategy. As long as you are in this courtyard, what is really going on outside is How many people know you Jiugong Xiushi?"</p>

    <p>At this point, Jiugong Xiushi's face was filled with astonishment.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect Duyan's layout to have started so long ago.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I'm looking for a Duyan. Excuse me... should it be here?"</p>

    <p>At this time, a clear male voice that Duyan had never heard before came from outside the courtyard. Li Xian lifted the black-clothed ninja who had gone out to gather information with one hand like a chicken, and then casually threw the person in front of Duyan.</p>

    <p>He scratched his head politely and bowed slightly to apologize: "Sorry. It seems that I used a little too much force. After all, I haven't met a junior who only has Golden Core for a long time. But this person should not die." Please rest assured. "In modern cultivation society, it is illegal to kill people casually."</p>

    <p>Li Xian paid special attention when he first started. However, the cultivators of Golden Core are so fragile. In front of the eternal level powerhouse, they are simply a piece of grass in the wind.</p>

    <p>He didn't even push hard enough. The guy who went out there almost died.</p>

    <p>Duyan sent a total of two people out.</p>

    <p>The person thrown over by Li Xian is now in a dying state.</p>

    <p>As for the other ninja in black.</p>

    <p>Although he was unscathed, he was still quite frightened.</p>

    <p>In order to distinguish them easily, Li Xian plucked out all his hair.</p>

    <p>So at this time, Li Xian looked at the bald head and said politely: "Excuse me. If someone else is suffocating later, I would like to trouble you to continue artificial respiration."</p>

    <p>This situation could not help but increase the pressure of those present.</p>

    <p>No one knows where this madman suddenly came from... He is simply a devil!</p>

    <p>"I don't know you. Why are you here?" Duyan stepped forward. His hand was already on the samurai sword at his waist. He was particularly wary of Li Xian's sudden appearance.</p>

    <p>"I was entrusted by my master to deal with internal conflicts. In modern terms, you can also call me uncle?" Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>Then he analyzed the situation.</p>

    <p>Duyan didn't say a word.</p>

    <p>Li Xian could roughly figure out what was going on just by looking at it.</p>

    <p>Eternal level powerhouse. I have seen many cases where the creatures in the universe have become extinct due to racial strife.</p>

    <p>The family is fighting in front of us. An eternal master like Li Xian can guess what is going on with his buttocks.</p>

    <p>He immediately laughed and said, "But now it seems that you are already fighting among yourself. It seems inappropriate to use the identity of old uncle. Just think of me as an enthusiastic citizen passing by."</p>

    <p>"Enthusiastic... citizens..." Duyan's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I was just passing by and came to see what was going on. After all, a meteorite just fell on your house. It happened to break through the door of Jiugong's house."</p>

    <p>"Meteorite?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. A meteorite. Why is this meteorite so accurate? It just hit the door of Jiugong's house. If someone summoned it deliberately, it would be too unethical. It must be strongly condemned!" Li Xian said .</p>

    <p>"This meteorite... was summoned by you?" Duyan was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Eh. Have I been discovered." Li Xian sighs</p>

    <p>Duyan looked doubtful.</p>

    <p>He immediately reached out and strangled Jiugong Xiushi's neck: "Don't act rashly! If you come here again, I will break his neck!"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm not coming."</p>

    <p>Li Xian took the initiative to take a step back: "Anyway, you will be on the road together soon."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Li Xian raised his head and looked at the sky.</p>

    <p>Everyone here looked along his line of sight. There was an extremely shining light in the sky. Two more huge meteorites were falling rapidly from the sky...</p>

    <p>Li Xian also engraved characters on these two meteorites.</p>

    <p>One East.</p>

    <p>One wind...</p>
