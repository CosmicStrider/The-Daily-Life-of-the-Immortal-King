  <h1>Chapter 1977 The fake show comes true</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Changzhe's sword caused the entire Number 2 Spirit World Trial Field to change color.</p>

    <p>The black crescent-shaped sword energy moved forward along the earth. Then it crushed forward in an unstoppable manner with astonishing destructive power.</p>

    <p>No one expected that this black sword energy would become more powerful. It was like a winding black dragon.</p>

    <p>Everything in its path was ground to dust and ceased to exist...</p>

    <p>When the astonishing sword energy came, the offensive at the front of the battlefield went smoothly. The leader of the Wuxiang Peak led the crowd to resist. It was about to surrender.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, an astonishing sword energy roared out from outside the main hall, overturning the entire mountain.</p>

    <p>At that moment, everyone's protection mechanism was triggered and they were sent directly out of the spirit world trial field.</p>

    <p>This was a huge destruction like the end of the world. No one could have imagined that a sword from an elite high school student could cut the entire world into pieces.</p>

    <p>In fact, when the black crescent sword energy was generated, most of the surveillance equipment in Jiutian Jingmi Hospital was disconnected.</p>

    <p>The disconnection is accompanied by a continuous system overheating alarm.</p>

    <p>"What's going on!" Teng Luchen was looking at it well at first, but then the whole screen went black. Then a string of bright red 404 flashing numbers flew past the screen.</p>

    <p>"Huiteng Lao. The Number 2 trial ground collapsed... everyone was forced to exit the spirit world. This includes the actors. And it is certain that the actors cannot go back." Jing Heqiu said.</p>

    <p>If it is just a regular system failure, even if students are forcibly pushed out of the spirit world, the actors in the spirit world will still be online. Because they have different permissions, they will not be directly offline due to a regular failure.</p>

    <p>But the current situation is obviously unusual.</p>

    <p>"Is the system directly damaged..." Teng Luchen was also puzzled: "How powerful is Classmate Li's sword?"</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao is worried too much. No matter how strong an elite high school student is, it is impossible for him to use such sword energy."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said: "The preliminary results analyzed by the technical department are now available."</p>

    <p>"How to say?"</p>

    <p>"They think it was probably when Classmate Li swung his sword that the sword energy happened to hit the secret door of the Number 2 training ground, causing the entire training ground to collapse."</p>

    <p>"Secret door?"</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao should know. All the trial grounds in the spirit world are transplanted from real scenes using spells and professional magic weapons. They are like a huge puzzle. And these puzzles need to be linked together. You need professional magic tools to build secret doors... This is an invisible substance. It is used to link every scene with the stability of the spiritual world."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said: "And for safety reasons, the secret door will change its position every second..."</p>

    <p>"I understand. What you mean is that Student Li's sword energy just hit the changing secret door." Teng Luchen said.</p>

    <p>"Exactly." Jing Heqiu bowed.</p>

    <p>"There is such a thing..."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen was speechless. From the current point of view, this seems to be the only explanation.</p>

    <p>The secret door is equivalent to the stabilizer linking the scene. Once destroyed, the world will immediately fall into collapse.</p>

    <p>However, after such a damage, the entire spiritual world will need to undergo maintenance and repair work for a period of time. It is impossible to rematch or conduct the subsequent selection test.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen secretly thought that he was unlucky. He didn't expect that he would encounter this kind of thing at the critical moment of the Earth Center Project. However, this Number 2 spiritual world trial was considered a success.</p>

    <p>At least he gained Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan, and recognized Qu Shuling's true face.</p>

    <p>Now he also counts the top students among these elite high school students.</p>

    <p>"Hurry up and arrange the repair work in the spirit world. Also confirm the information of all students and cast and crew. See if anyone is injured."</p>

    <p>After Teng Luchen finished speaking, he sighed.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to choose a partner from the final winner of the Number 2 Spirit World Trial Field to participate in the Earth Center Project. However, he did not expect that the plan could not keep up with the changes.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I will arrange it now. But..."</p>

    <p>"But what?"</p>

    <p>"That's it, Mr. Teng. According to the system display, there seems to be one person left in the spirit world now..." Jing Heqiu said awkwardly while swiping his tablet.</p>

    <p>"The secret doors were destroyed. Everyone was sent out. How could there be anyone still there?" Teng Luchen showed great confusion.</p>

    <p>The Number 2 Proving Ground is now completely shattered. All the built scenes no longer exist. If anyone is trapped in it, it will be a white space. There is nothing.</p>

    <p>"It's classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said awkwardly: "Do you remember Mr. Teng? He had a privilege card in his hand... It should have been when everyone was forced out. The privilege card conflicted with it. It forced classmate Wang Ling to stay in the spirit world. The backup system shows that classmate Wang Ling's vital signs are currently stable. There are no abnormalities."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen was completely stunned by these words.</p>

    <p>There is actually such an operation...</p>

    <p>He was silent for several minutes. Finally he said, "This classmate Wang is indeed the Sixty Mascot..."</p>

    <p>Originally, he always thought there was something special about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But after this trial in the spirit world, Teng Luchen discovered that maybe his original judgment about Wang Ling was indeed wrong.</p>

    <p>Maybe this kid is really just lucky...</p>

    <p>"Hurry up and repair the passage. Bring classmate Wang out safely."</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao, do you want to see him again?"</p>

    <p>"No need. Let him go back and have a good rest... By the way. Remember to send him a box of noodles as a token of sympathy."</p>

    <p>"This subordinate understands."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling was rescued, it was already early morning on Friday, January 17th.</p>

    <p>He deliberately stayed in the spirit world, because only Wang Ling knew the true situation best. The collapse of the spirit world was definitely not caused by the destruction of the secret door. It was purely because Zhanye's sword energy was too fierce.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling deliberately stayed in the spirit world. It looked like a black magic operation that consumed the privilege card. In fact, it was to stay and destroy the secret door. This made the accident more real.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, this second trip to the spirit world was still very rewarding. At least he knew that Teng Luchen's attention had shifted away from him, and he began to care about Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>Especially Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>The various outstanding performances in the trial field this time were eye-catching in every aspect. They were far more dazzling than themselves.</p>

    <p>Of course Wang Ling also knows. As a director, since he helped Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan arrange the script, whether the script can be self-justified is also the key.</p>

    <p>"Disciples of the Mist God. The identities of the disciples of the Arrow God are all fake. What are you going to do next?" Wang Ying's voice came from Wang Ling's mind on the way home from Jiutian Jingmi Academy's special car.</p>

    <p>"Then... the fake show comes true..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a while. Then he gave a concise response.</p>
