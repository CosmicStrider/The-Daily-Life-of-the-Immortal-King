  <h1>Chapter 2078 He has 1 Golden Core. What if you let him hit him once?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For Hong Siqi, this is not a question of whether the Sword Master's disciples are Golden Core or not.</p>

    <p>He was a Venerated Immortal. He was slapped in the face by a Golden Core monk. No matter who the monk was, his reputation would not be good after all.</p>

    <p>And there are so many people here using equipment to record!</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi saw that some people started live streaming!</p>

    <p>This is too much!</p>

    <p>Everyone is waiting to see his joke!</p>

    <p>"Lord Emperor..." Hong Siqi begged. He faced the sky. There was even a hint of crying in his voice. Venerated Immortal. Loan immortal. It is unbelievable to be so humble.</p>

    <p>Let's not talk about whether Mixiu's Emperor is as strong as Hong Siqi. Even if he is not, Hong Siqi would not dare to make a mistake.</p>

    <p>A big shot like this. God knows if there is any master hidden behind him...</p>

    <p>He thought he had achieved Venerated Immortal. He had become the first person in the Huaxiu bloodline to reach the top of Venerated Immortal. Unexpectedly, this sword master was even more outrageous than him. He was directly canonized!</p>

    <p>The key lies in the Huaxiu Kingdom. One is as famous as the Sword Master. But there are nine others!</p>

    <p>The top ten generals are all extraordinary!</p>

    <p>And they were all promoted to the ninth level of True Immortal a long time ago. The rumored strongest Explosive Saint: Bai Xing! Ranked first among the ten generals in terms of overall combat effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Although there is no news about being promoted to Venerated Immortal yet. But who knows whether these people will practice secretly behind your back...</p>

    <p>Information is blocked. Almost all the top cultivating countries in this world have their own routines. It always makes people feel that they are hard to guard against.</p>

    <p>"No! Master Emperor... if he hits me, it won't be my face, but your face!" Hong Siqi begged.</p>

    <p>"Pah!"</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Muyu's slap had not yet fallen. Across the distance in the void, Mixiu's Emperor slapped him first.</p>

    <p>This slap was a slap in the face. There was a bright red five-fingerprint directly on his cheek. On the one hand, Mixiu's Emperor used his own actions to respond to the disrespectful behavior just now.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Mixiu's Emperor himself is testing whether Hong Siqi is really in a state of sealing the spirit. He cannot use the power of the realm to counterattack.</p>

    <p>As a result, everything was as the sword master said.</p>

    <p>Holy Realm.</p>

    <p>It's really scary...</p>

    <p>Venerated Immortal realm. Ever since the legend of Zhenyuan immortals, the earth has been restricted to the highest realm because of the {International True Immortal Convention}.</p>

    <p>But now, who would have thought. Now even being promoted to Venerated Immortal has become less valuable.</p>

    <p>Because in the eyes of the world, the highest realm is the legendary existence.</p>

    <p>But the realm. Where does it end?</p>

    <p>As long as people have desires, they will continue to pursue them.</p>

    <p>So the modern world of cultivation is not a game of "Law of the Dark Forest" in the universe?</p>

    <p>As long as you still have the trump card in your hand, no cultivation country will easily provoke a war, because no one will choose to take the risk behind it and become a sinner in this world.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Hong Siqi's slap must be received.</p>

    <p>It's not that he couldn't be slapped because he was a naturalized citizen of Mixiu.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a difference in understanding, which leads to the deviation.</p>

    <p>At least the current attitude of Mixiu's Emperor is very clear. He wants to use the palm of the Sword Saint Disciple to completely cut off the last blood connection between Hong Siqi and the Huaxiu Kingdom.</p>

    <p>Only hatred can push a person to continue to move forward.</p>

    <p>Mixiu's Emperor had a very good calculation. He felt that it might be a good thing that Hong Siqi received this slap. On the road of cultivation, not everyone who follows the white path can become immortal.</p>

    <p>Since ancient times, those who have gone further and further on the detour are not without exception.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it means blackening.</p>

    <p>How do you say something?</p>

    <p>Whitening is twice as weak. Blackening is three points stronger.</p>

    <p>This is not completely unreasonable.</p>

    <p>"He's just a Golden Core. He gives him a slap. It won't hurt or itch. So what?"</p>

    <p>Perhaps in order to take care of Hong Siqi's last bit of face, Mixiu's Emperor's voice came directly through the void this time, communicating directly with Hong Siqi himself.</p>

    <p>These resolute words made Hong Siqi completely give up hope of resistance.</p>

    <p>But in fact, while everyone was discussing whether to fight or not, and watching the excitement, the most nervous person was actually Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>The little guy looked calm on the outside, but actually he was panicking inside.</p>

    <p>Of course he doesn't want to fight.</p>

    <p>After all, what will happen if this palm is applied? Even Wang Muyu himself doesn't know.</p>

    <p>But now the water polo protects him very well. In addition, there are Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei over there to provide cover. So even if Wang Muyu takes action in this matter, he thinks there is a high probability that he can find someone who can take the blame.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Maybe this is just your fate, little Hong.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>After all, he has been imitating Wang Ling. So every time before taking action, he would ask himself about his compassion for the common people...</p>

    <p>But now he has discovered it. It doesn't matter whether you have mercy or not. There will be times like this when someone begs you to fight.</p>

    <p>Even the monks who were joining in the fun started to make noises.</p>

    <p>They actually couldn't hear the conversation on Mixiu's Emperor's side. But they had the caring translator Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>This matter was directly instigated by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>"Sword Saint Disciple! I don't know who you are, but this is your chance to become famous! Your master has paved the way for you, and you don't even dare to strike?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah! If you didn't land that punch, it wouldn't have been any fun at all!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So are these people born to be abused?</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>His young mind was greatly shocked at this time. It seemed as if he had grown up in an instant.</p>

    <p>Since. He wants to be beaten.</p>

    <p>Then he won't be polite anymore...</p>

    <p>He was under the cover of the water polo. Everyone saw a drop of water slowly separating from the water polo. This was a drop of water that had been carefully carved. People with eyesight can see it if they look closely. A small drop of water was accurately pinched into the shape of a palm.</p>

    <p>"This is the Sword Master's Wuji Sword... the legendary trick of dripping water through stone!"</p>

    <p>Some people still recognized this trick.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu is now learning and selling his skills. In fact, he is also verifying his identity as a disciple of the Sword Master in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>This way, even if something happens later, at least no one will turn their attention to Wang Ling. </p>

    <p>Hong Siqi saw this scene from a distance. The slap he imagined was Wang Muyu coming up to slap him. But he never expected that the slap turned into water droplets and came from a distance.</p>

    <p>He was relieved. He stood up directly, raised his head and chest, and laughed on the spot: "Junior, this little drop of water. I'm afraid you can't even tear my cassock."</p>

    <p>However, the laughter stopped suddenly when the water droplet slowly flew halfway. The speed of the water droplet suddenly accelerated at this moment!</p>

    <p>A golden avenue spreads forward from the drop of water. It is extremely divine and dazzling. It leads directly to Hong Siqi's chest! It's like a beam of sunlight.</p>

    <p>At first, no one cared that it was just a drop of water, a palm shot by a Golden Core monk, and a beam of light that suddenly burst out from the air. Until the beam of light hit Hong Siqi's chest.</p>

    <p>Then the water droplet starts propelling forward at the speed of light...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>When they got closer, Wang Muyu's water droplet just got close to Hong Siqi. It exploded in an instant!</p>

    <p>Under the astonished eyes of everyone, a small mushroom cloud rose from Yama Island...</p>
