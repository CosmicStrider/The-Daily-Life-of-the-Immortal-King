  <h1>Chapter 2043 Ancient Genius</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Five minutes. Just walking to little Nantianmen. This is something Sun Ru could not have imagined.</p>

    <p>She still remembered the first time she came here. If her grandmother hadn't secretly helped her, it would have been hundreds of years before she could reach the other side with her own strength.</p>

    <p>Little Nantianmen. This is the fourth map of the Sun family's ancestral land. Wang Ling calmly jumped over the door. An immortal palace wrapped in chaotic mist came into view.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said. After passing through little Nantianmen, the immortal palace hidden behind little Nantianmen is actually the key to the fifth map.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw an upright palm print on the door of the Immortal Palace. The five fingers were particularly distinct. At that moment, Wang Ling's King's Eyes traveled through the ages. It was as if he saw a man with long golden hair. The scene of a handsome young man with long hair pressing his palm on the gate of the Immortal Palace.</p>

    <p>Is it unlocked by palm prints...</p>

    <p>After a brief trance, Wang Ling woke up.</p>

    <p>Although he changed the restrictions on the Sun family's ancestral land, the unlocking of the palm print really surprised him.</p>

    <p>The inheritance about unlocking the gate of the Immortal Palace is now left with Sun Yiyuan. In other words, only the palm of the real head of the family can open the gate of the Immortal Palace.</p>

    <p>"It's so cheating. There is such a strange setting." In the core world, Immortal Toya couldn't laugh or cry: "But we have come here. I don't think there is anything we can do. With Ling Zhenren's strength, it is definitely not a problem to break through."</p>

    <p>Breaking down the door by force...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard Immortal Toya's proposal. He felt very helpless.</p>

    <p>Although he had previously decided not to cause more damage to the Sun family's ancestral land, now he did not want to reveal his secret in front of Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>For this plan, we really had to force the gate of the Immortal Palace open.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling had no choice but to step forward calmly. He placed his hand on the palm print, pretending to identify it through the palm print.</p>

    <p>In fact, a pressure is directly applied at the moment when the palm covers it.</p>

    <p>He swore.</p>

    <p>He really conserved his strength. He didn't use all his strength.</p>

    <p>Just a simple push...</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that the gate of the Immortal Palace was as brittle as paper. With a bang, it collapsed backwards.</p>

    <p>The violent sound of the door collapsing along with the sound of rolling gravel resounded through the entire little Nantianmen. Sun Ru was so frightened that she covered her ears on the spot. When she regained consciousness, the door of the Immortal Hall had broken in front of her feet.</p>

    <p>The fifteen-foot-high gate of the Immortal Palace actually collapsed from behind and broke into three parts.</p>

    <p>The key is that she felt that Wang Ling really didn't use much force. How could the gate of the Immortal Palace be broken so completely?</p>

    <p>"Hey. I didn't expect that I had been sleeping for such a long time. The gate of the Immortal Palace has been in disrepair for a long time... How could it be so fragile?" Faced with the mess in front of her, Sun Ru couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p>

    <p>The ancestral brain healing ability once again played a vital role at this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Immortal Toya secretly breathed a sigh of relief. As long as there is no suspicion, everything is easy to talk about.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, as the gate of the Immortal Palace was forcibly pushed open, the jasper-colored three-legged ancient tripod located in the center of the entire glorious and spacious Immortal Palace began to rise into a cloud of smoke.</p>

    <p>The ancient tripod is huge in size. It is as high as a small villa. Each foot is held by a legendary beast. From the appearance, Wang Ling can identify the three legendary beasts: Pixiu, Taotie and True Dragon.</p>

    <p>But now is obviously not the time to appreciate this ancient tripod. Something seems to be awakening with the spreading smoke.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a chilling rotten smell began to spread in the air.</p>

    <p>"How is it possible..." The expression on Sun Ru's face changed obviously. She recognized this smell, so she showed a very panicked look. She instinctively summoned the thunder golden knife in her hand. Her whole body was full of fighting spirit. The fighting instinct is directly stimulated by this smell.</p>

    <p>There is no need to think carefully. Wang Ling can roughly guess that something must have been suppressed in this ancient cauldron back then.</p>

    <p>A long time has passed. With the cautious personality of the founder of the Sun family, no matter what kind of creature is in this ancient cauldron, it has been suppressed for so long. it has long become a corpse.</p>

    <p>So this is definitely not some kind of rebirth. It's because he forced his way into the Immortal Palace, which triggered the protective mechanism of the Immortal Palace. The creatures that were originally suppressed in the ancient cauldron were suppressed by the spells arranged by the ancestor of the Sun family in advance. Awakened. Became the special guardian of this immortal temple.</p>

    <p>But Sun Ru was obviously unaware of this situation. Even if she had entered the Immortal Palace before, she had always followed the normal procedure. Instead of directly pushing down the door like him.</p>

    <p>The unequal information gap immediately made Sun Ru think that the terrible guy who was suppressed back then was about to resurrect from the ancient tripod.</p>

    <p>"It's Xiu Fengnian... he's not dead yet..."</p>

    <p>The expression on Sun Ru's face was solemn. She didn't expect that she could still sense Xiu Fengnian in the Immortal Palace.</p>

    <p>This is a peerless genius who was suppressed by the founder of the Sun family in ancient times and relied on evil methods to practice in ancient cauldrons. At a young age, his strength is already equal to that of the ancients. He is an otherworldly existence. It is also the nightmare of countless geniuses in ancient times.</p>

    <p>Almost none of the geniuses who were targeted by Xiu Fengnian survived. And Xufeng Nian had also targeted Sun Ru at the beginning. It was a pity that the ancestor of the Sun family found a way to suppress him before he could take action.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sun Ru didn't expect that after being suppressed, Xiu Fengnian directly "trained" to become the guardian of the Immortal Palace.</p>

    <p>But Sun Ru, who was completely unaware of this matter, thought that Xiu Fengnian had resurrected from the ancient tripod.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru, there is no need to panic. Ling Zhenren is here."</p>

    <p>"But... this person is really dangerous!" Sun Ru said.</p>

    <p>She heard that the ancestor of the Sun family also had the experience of being suppressed in the alchemy furnace. As a result, the suppression by the alchemy furnace not only did not hurt the ancestor, but instead allowed him to forge the powerful Fire Eye Golden Dragon in the alchemy furnace.</p>

    <p>Although there are differences between the alchemy furnace and the ancient tripod, the means of suppression are essentially the same. Even she can wake up from her slumber across such a long period of time. It seems to be a very reasonable operation to be able to revive in Xiu Fengnian.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the ancient cauldron in front trembled. A black aurora jumped out of it and then fell quickly. A young man with a bandage wrapped around his upper body and a stern look appeared.</p>

    <p>Just like Sun Ru described, his face was full of coldness and ruthlessness. His long black hair was shawl. His pants were torn into strips. His hands and feet were all wearing heavy shackles. He just stood there barefoot. It gives people a sense of horror from the soul.</p>

    <p>Comes from ancient times. Is he a genius who became the guardian of the Immortal Palace after being suppressed by the ancestor of the Sun family?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was originally not very interested in the origin of Xiu Fengnian.</p>

    <p>But now, when it turned into a black aurora in Xiu Fengnian and stood in front of him in a ragged, embarrassed but murderous manner, Wang Ling instantly knew the reason why the founder of the Sun family suppressed him.</p>

    <p>Because he could feel that Xiu Fengnian had the blood of an alien god...</p>
