  <h1>Chapter 1755 There are two people at my door</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong took action. It was almost effortless to rescue Jiang Yingying. With just a few pieces of information like Yin Hu, there was no way to stop her.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise. The door of the building where Jiang Yingying was imprisoned was opened by the red light simulated by Aohai. The simple stone door instantly fell into pieces and was neatly cut into tofu pieces.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stepped in wearing a nine-tailed fox mask. The Yin Hu hurriedly grabbed Jiang Yingying and strangled her throat.</p>

    <p>"If you come any closer, I will kill her!" Yin Hu was really scared. The expression on his face was distorted.</p>

    <p>"Oh."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled softly. She ignored Yin Hu and the others at all. Sword energy surged from her body. In an instant, she differentiated into several incarnations of sword energy. They appeared on the scene at an incredible speed, including Yin Hu. Behind several people from the Roaring Heavenly Alliance, they looked like ghosts.</p>

    <p>These incarnations of sword energy were accurately positioned. They appeared almost instantly. They instantly caught Yin Hu and others with their backhands. Then they held their legs and buried them directly into the ground. Only one head was exposed.</p>

    <p>The operation was completed in an instant. Yin Hu and others had no time to react.</p>

    <p>This sword energy was really too strong. It was extremely fierce. When the incarnation of the sword energy approached, the cloth covering Jiang Yingying's eyes was blown away on the spot.</p>

    <p>After a dazzling halo, Jiang Yingying finally made out the appearance of the person in the light and shadow...</p>

    <p>"Who are you..."</p>

    <p>"I was entrusted by your grandfather to save you." Sun Rong was stunned for a moment, then spoke.</p>

    <p>She deliberately changed her voice. She didn't want Jiang Yingying to hear it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"There are two people at my door. One is a scarecrow. The other is also a scarecrow..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling suddenly remembered a passage from an ancient literary classic.</p>

    <p>The name of this classic is {Wangu Xun Shuo}. It is a collection of classic quotations from major literary masters in the Wangu period. It is said to be of great help in purifying the state of mind and even achieving breakthroughs in critical bottlenecks.</p>

    <p>As for the sudden recollection of this passage, it was also due to the sight of these black sacred birds woven from the "doomsday straw" in front of us, tens of thousands of black divine birds, and all of them were woven from such a miraculous material, so it can be said that the strength of the person behind it was not bad at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked the other Eternals in the Corpse Map. No one seemed to be able to think of a person who was particularly good at using this kind of straw.</p>

    <p>Because there are many eternal people who can weave "doomsday straw." Since everyone knows how to do it, naturally not many people will pay attention to the situation of those around them.</p>

    <p>If someone deliberately hid his ability for eternity and only showed it now, then it would really be difficult for these eternity people to think about it.</p>

    <p>"This person must be hiding very deep. Weaving doomsday straw is very troublesome. To be able to weave these blackbirds on such a large scale. This person is at least from the ancestral realm."</p>

    <p>"As you can see, in terms of the ancestral realm, what is the realm? Is it Human Ancestor, Earthly Ancestor or Heavenly Ancestor? Or is it possible that it is Ancestor King or Ancestor Immortal?"</p>

    <p>"Ancestor King Ancestor Immortal is impossible. The probability of the above realms is higher."</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's pointless for us to discuss this person's level here. Anyway, it's impossible for this person to really beat Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"I don't think it's a question of whether or not you can beat Ling Zhenren, but even Miss Sun Rong is hard to deal with."</p>

    <p>Inside the Supreme Corpse Map, a group of Eternals were having a heated discussion with their skeletal bodies on their heads.</p>

    <p>No doubt. These are the truth.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's concern about these Eternal Ones is not so much about how strong they are. It is about what exactly did these people do after escaping from Dao Ancestor Wang's "clutches"? And why did they do so? Have you embarked on a path of helping others do evil?</p>

    <p>Of course, these questions are all for later.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling has not figured it out yet. The real reason why Dao Ancestor Wang used various excuses to seal the Eternals in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>He felt that the best way to know about this matter was to go directly to Dao Ancestor Wang and ask... Mainly because he didn't have any clues at the moment.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it will take until the Year of the Monkey and the Horse to fully deduce the logic of Dao Ancestor Wang's behavior. But put aside all factors and just talk about it based on intuition. Wang Ling feels more like Dao Ancestor Wang's behavior. In fact, it is A kind of protection.</p>

    <p>Although Dao Ancestor Wang's current reputation is not good. He has always been regarded as an enemy by these eternal beings, and was dubbed "Old Thief Wang."</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still feels that his intuition may be right.</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking, he had already entered the vicinity of Duobao City wearing a snow-white sportswear. Jiang Yingying was rescued by Sun Rong. Therefore, the purpose of his trip was not to rescue Jiang Yingying... but In order to find Wang Muyu in advance and avoid an own mistake.</p>

    <p>He found that this little kid had a bad temper. He usually acted well-behaved and sweet, but he always fell out with her.</p>

    <p>After all, he is still a child.</p>

    <p>According to the arrangement from Zhuo Yi, Wang Ling also went to the Lingzhi stall and took away the pass to the underground intelligence trading market and a raccoon mask.</p>

    <p>But he had just put it on. An old man suddenly walked over to him.</p>

    <p>"Young man, where did you come from?"</p>

    <p>A very familiar voice. I seem to have heard it on TV.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned around. There was a look of astonishment underneath the mask.</p>

    <p>Because the person standing behind him at this time is none other than Martial Saint Jiang himself...</p>

    <p>However, Martial Saint Jiang deliberately used the method of transfiguration to avoid letting others see his true face.</p>

    <p>But this kind of shape-changing method can never escape the eyes of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He also came to get his pass and mask. He didn't see what Wang Ling's face looked like. When he walked in, Wang Ling had already put on the raccoon mask.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this familiar operation, Martial Saint Jiang instantly knew that the young man in front of him might be someone sent by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang looked at Wang Ling. He raised his eyebrows and said, "Young man, you are a bit courageous. Are you here to perform a mission too?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint didn't say much, and there was no smile on his face. He immediately put on the Sichuan opera mask prepared by the shop owner. Then he looked at Wang Ling: "Since everyone is here, let's act together."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He could feel the youthful vigor in Wang Ling. Therefore, he judged that Wang Ling was very young and his strength was not too high.</p>

    <p>It is a good thing for young people to be motivated. But the underground trading market is a big black market after all. The water inside is very deep. If you just know how to rush forward blindly, that is a reckless behavior.</p>

    <p>"Young man, sometimes it's good to be motivated. But you have to take a look at the actual situation. But don't worry. Since I'm here, we can act together to ensure that you are fine. In addition, this is also a rare opportunity to learn."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Another ten seconds passed. Wang Ling followed Martial Saint Jiang into the underground intelligence trading market.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the owner of Lingzhi Store, who was responsible for handing over masks and passes, also took off his own mask.</p>

    <p>He is not the others. It is Zhou Ziyi who was roped in by Zhuo Yi to help.</p>

    <p>After seeing Wang Ling entering the underground trading market with Martial Saint, Zhou Ziyi immediately called Zhuo Yi directly to report the situation: "Master ... Grand Master Wang he took the token and just happened to bump into the Martial Saint, and now he went in with the Martial Saint!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held his forehead: "..."</p>

    <p>This is really going to be a mahjong table!</p>
