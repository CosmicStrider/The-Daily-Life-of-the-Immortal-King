  <h1>Chapter 1966 Wang Ling's little thoughts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was not too surprised by Qu Shuling's decision. In essence, both Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan are kind-hearted people.</p>

    <p>He found that it seemed that all the friends who were closely united around him had this quality.</p>

    <p>Although they can't say they like Qu Shuling's attitude. They even began to dislike Qu Shuling after participating in two spiritual world trials and learning his true identity. But they are still willing to believe that Qu Shuling can be improved.</p>

    <p>Of course. The bigger reason is not only because Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan foolishly believed it. The more important reason is because of their nationality...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. It was only because of his nationality that he saved Qu Shuling's life.</p>

    <p>Although Li Changzhe is a talkative person on the surface, he is actually very thoughtful. Qu Shuling now represents the top image of elite high school students.</p>

    <p>There are countless capitals staring at him outside the training ground. If he directly eliminates Qu Shuling in the training ground now, it will undoubtedly be an act of ruining people's jobs.</p>

    <p>Although you can feel temporarily comfortable, it can also cause you to get angry.</p>

    <p>"Just let Wang Ling use this cracked spiritual sword. And the sword spirit will be unconscious along with the sword master. It depends on the strength of the spiritual sword itself. How strong can it be if it is cracked? I have to think of a way. Just repair it." At this time, Zhang Linyan suddenly said, directly interrupting Wang Ling's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"There is an old weapon refining furnace in the Haoren Sect. It can be used for repair. But... what is the specific material of this Zhanye sword? We need to find out. Otherwise, we will have to poorly repair Brother Qu's sword." said the senior brother of Haoren Peak.</p>

    <p>"This is easy. It's just about repairing the cracks. Use a little bit of material to mash it and fill it in the cracks. Then bake it in the oven again. Senior brother, please don't get involved in this matter. We need to repair Zhanye. Let's go to the Haoren Peak. I'm afraid that old refining furnace will explode directly."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe put his hands on his hips and said with a smile, "There are so many natural and earthly treasures in the back mountain. There are fourth-level, fifth-level and even higher ones. Isn't this better than Zhanye's own materials? I think it's better to wait until the materials are collected before we discuss it."</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>What a genius spoke. Everyone was speechless.</p>

    <p>Although most of the people here are not master craftsmen. The steps to repair cracks... doesn't seem to involve filling the cracks with materials and then rebaking them in the furnace.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe's speech subverted the perceptions of many people here.</p>

    <p>This is a deliberate attempt to deceive Shu Ling...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment. He stared at the cracked Zhanye in his hand. A different thought arose in his heart.</p>

    <p>About half an hour later, at the gate of Wuxiang Peak, in front of the commander's camp where twenty peaks gathered, a black spirit sword with cracks swaggered across the sky transporting a package.</p>

    <p>When the people at Wuxiang Peak saw this scene, their hearts froze immediately. They recognized this sword and knew that it was Qu Shuling's natal spiritual sword...</p>

    <p>Now there are cracks, and it suddenly and strangely appears in front of the enemy's commander's camp. This is definitely not the result of Qu Shuling's own operation.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling... was defeated!</p>

    <p>This scene undoubtedly boosted the morale of the people in Twenty Peaks.</p>

    <p>What kind of person is Qu Shuling?</p>

    <p>The supreme genius was defeated by their joint efforts!</p>

    <p>"This game is really interesting. Are you giving us trophies?" Chen Chao stretched out his hands in front of the coach's camp. He saw Zhanye holding the package behind him firmly in his hands.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw this and walked over quickly. She knew it was from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although there is no information about Wang Ling left on it. But now she is united with the Aohai human sword. The sword's heart is transparent. With the six senses infinitely amplified, the sense of smell is also doubled.</p>

    <p>Just above this Zhanye. She could smell Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It proves that Wang Ling has touched this sword. And also sent the sword here.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong opened the package immediately. It was filled with fourth-level and fifth-level treasures of heaven and earth that blinded everyone on the spot.</p>

    <p>During the team's sound transmission, Gu Shunzhi spoke. He said to Sun Rong; "I understand. Miss Rong. Ling Zhenren wants us to repair this spirit sword. That's why they brought so many heavenly materials and earthly treasures..."</p>

    <p>The second half of the sentence. Gu Shunzhi was silent for a while. He couldn't say it directly.</p>

    <p>Because he can tell. Among the heavenly materials and earthly treasures in this package, although most of the fourth- and fifth-level heavenly materials and earthly treasures come from the back mountain of Wuxiang Peak in the Number 2 trial site, there are some heavenly materials and earthly treasures inside. It is absolutely impossible to appear in this trial field. Now are also mixed in this package.</p>

    <p>These treasures of heaven, materials and earth are very small and are easily overlooked. Hidden in these large treasures of heaven, materials and earth, they will not be easily discovered at all.</p>

    <p>But people who know the goods can still tell the difference at a glance.</p>

    <p>This is because the spiritual energy concentration of high-level heavenly materials and earthly treasures is extremely different. Even if they are small in size, their concentration is astonishing.</p>

    <p>For example, there was only a piece of spiritual jade the size of a 1-yuan coin under the package. Gu Shunzhi could tell at a glance that it was an eighth-level high-grade material. The Tongtian Wall.</p>

    <p>And this material is impossible to appear in either the real world or the trial field. Because it comes from the Heavenly Dao star. It belongs to the universe's heavenly materials and earthly treasures from the God Realm.</p>

    <p>As a person of order, Gu Shunzhi's discernment ability is still online. Any cultivator with some experience can actually see it.</p>

    <p>At this time, he and Zhenyuan were both staring at the Tongtian Wall. The expressions on their faces were extremely exciting. They were both trying to figure out what Wang Ling meant by providing this eighth-level material.</p>

    <p>So this is...</p>

    <p>What do you mean by asking them to use these advanced materials to repair this Zhanye?</p>

    <p>As for the fourth- and fifth-level heavenly materials and earthly treasures collected on the back mountain, are they just a cover-up?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi is a little confused.</p>

    <p>The current relationship between this Qu and Ling Zhenren should be hostile.</p>

    <p>This Zhanye is his personal belonging. It is simply a waste to use such good cosmic materials to repair it...</p>

    <p>However, Gu Shunzhi decided to follow Wang Ling's wishes for the time being.</p>

    <p>This is Ling Zhenren's decision!</p>

    <p>Is it possible for ordinary people like them to figure it out?</p>

    <p>"Senior Gu, why did you just stop halfway?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing." Gu Shunzhi said: "Ling Zhenren means that he wants us to repair this sword. But the heavenly materials and earthly treasures used for repair have actually been designated. They are in this bag of heavenly materials and earthly treasures... Only one piece is used for repair. The rest are all disguises. There should be ready-made high-quality weapon refining furnaces on Wuxiang Peak. As for the repair work, I think I will leave it to Zhenyuan Taoist."</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>She almost forgot.</p>

    <p>Senior Zhenyuan here is the real leader in the world of weapon refining!</p>

    <p>After all, this is the existence that created the gate to another world back then!</p>

    <p>Repairing a high school student's spiritual sword is definitely something that the Zhenyuan Immortal can easily grasp.</p>

    <p>It's just that even Zhenyuan's hands are shaking now...</p>

    <p>After all, he has to fill a cosmic-level material into a high school student's spirit sword... If the operation is wrong, things will become very embarrassing.</p>
