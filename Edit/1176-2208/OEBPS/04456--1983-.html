  <h1>Chapter 1983 No. But you can play with him</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Unexpectedly, things eventually took an unpredictable step. </p>

    <p>The new version of the talisman's ability to assimilate personality is truly too incredible. If it were an ordinary Wang Ling, he wouldn't even have time to dodge this kind of challenge... There is absolutely no way he would be able to accept it so easily.</p>

    <p>In fact, after accepting this challenge letter, Wang Ling felt extremely regretful in his heart. He could feel that he felt strange today.</p>

    <p>He has become a little different from his usual self...</p>

    <p>After seeing the challenge letter sent by Dai Tianchun remotely with a spiritual sword, Wang Ling's heart was filled with a rare desire to win.</p>

    <p>As long as the envelope of the challenge letter is opened, the challenge is deemed to be accepted. The letter contains secrets that can let the person who writes the letter know about it instantly.</p>

    <p>In other words, it is already impossible to pretend that nothing happened.</p>

    <p>Even if Principal Chen didn't open this letter, it was still open...</p>

    <p>If you have heard anything about this Dai Tianchun, you will definitely know that this person is the type of person who is unreasonable and unreasonable. Once the letter is opened, there can be absolutely no regrets.</p>

    <p>"My God... Classmate Wang Ling is so brave. He dares to take this..."</p>

    <p>"Dai Tianchun from Shengke, known as Dai Crazy Devil, once beat almost every principal in a secret team training jointly held by major school sects. And he was ruthless..."</p>

    <p>"It's over, it's over... our school is going to be gone. Principal Chen will be sent to the hospital and lie there for hundreds of years, right?"</p>

    <p>Many students began to feel pessimistic. Although Principal Chen is also known as a tactical genius, who can resist the sharp edge of this Crazy Demon in the face of this solo between principals?</p>

    <p>No matter how clever Principal Chen is, even if he is a tactical wizard, he must combine the corresponding terrain and form to maximize his tactical and strategic abilities.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong arrived at the scene with everyone from the student union (Gray Cult believers), there were already many people watching around Wang Ling, while maintaining order in the field. Sun Rong gently held Wang Ling's arm and said, "Everyone, please stop watching. Let's go to class as usual! Let us leave the rest of the matter to our student union!"</p>

    <p>Although this incident happened very suddenly, Sun Rong felt that the overall situation was not completely out of control.</p>

    <p>And she didn't know why. She even felt like it was a bit of a blessing in disguise.</p>

    <p>Because now everyone is beginning to worry about the winner of the principal solo between Principal Chen and Principal Dai. On the contrary, they have forgotten that Wang Ling became a little abnormal today.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Calm down..." Under the cover of several people, Sun Rong quickly brought Wang Ling back to the student union office.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry." Wang Ling apologized at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>Even this point is surprisingly consistent with Li Changzhe's character...</p>

    <p>"Hey. Actually, it's not your fault." Sun Rong held up his forehead. Then she said to Wang Ling: "Regular Talisman. Is it here with you?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. Yes. It's on me." Wang Ling said. Then he opened his palm. A magic talisman with red characters on a yellow background lay quietly on his palm along with a ray of light.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong discovered it. Wang Ling, who usually only answers with the word "um", seems to be more likable.</p>

    <p>"All the strange things you feel now are all caused by the new version of Talisman. So you still need to replace it with the regular Talisman. Now, let me help you change to Talisman."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said. Then she started directly in the student union office and started to pull up Wang Ling's coat.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong. What are you?" Wang Ling was startled by Sun Rong's sudden move.</p>

    <p>"Uh... sorry!" Sun Rong's face turned red. To be honest, she didn't think about it at all. When Wang Ling reminded her, she realized that she was actually taking advantage of it. When she was taking off Wang Ling's school uniform, she felt bad all over. She was so shy that she wanted to dig a hole in the ground and crawl in.</p>

    <p>She immediately raised her hands and faced away from Wang Ling. Her face turned red: "You believe me. I didn't mean it... Classmate Wang Ling... I just wanted to help..."</p>

    <p>"I can do it myself." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"Okay... then you can change it yourself. I've locked the door." Sun Rong said while covering her eyes with her hands.</p>

    <p>She was extremely shy. Even with her eyes open, even with her eyes closed. Although there was an evil voice in her heart telling her that she might as well take this opportunity to take a peek. Anyway, the sight only seeped through the gaps between her fingers. Wang Ling would not find out...</p>

    <p>But when this evil voice sounded in her heart, Sun Rong had a high degree of doubt about herself.</p>

    <p>She would actually have such strange thoughts...</p>

    <p>Sigh. Her character is really terrible!</p>

    <p>But in the end. Sun Rong still held back. Although the evil voice in her heart kept ringing, she still didn't take that step after all.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Are you okay?" After calming down, Sun Rong took a deep breath and asked.</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling gave her the correct answer.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong then removed her hands and opened her eyes.</p>

    <p>Then the frontal view directly witnessed Wang Ling being shirtless not wearing his school uniform short sleeves.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong only felt that her blood pressure rose on the spot!</p>

    <p>She blushed and turned around. She was a little incoherent: "You... didn't you say you were fine? Classmate Wang Ling. You... liar..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling opened the challenge letter of Shengke, the teachers of Number 60 High School specially held a meeting in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>In the absence of Principal Chen and History Teacher Wang, the overall situation of the meeting was fully presided over by Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>This is the first time Jin Deng has presided over the conference since he assumed the pseudonym "Huo Ding" as the vice president.</p>

    <p>Maybe he guessed that someone would bring up Wang Ling's issue of opening letters. Jin Deng spoke directly at the beginning of the meeting: "This age is the age when curiosity is strong. Students are curious. It is not necessarily a bad thing. This will contribute to the future creativity of our country... Our meeting was not originally intended to discuss punishment."</p>

    <p>This speech made several teachers present speechless. This protection... was too obvious. Although they don't know why the vice principal Huo Ding is so protective of Wang Ling. But he is the vice principal, the teachers must give face.</p>

    <p>Vice Principal Huo talked about this. The teachers were naturally speechless.</p>

    <p>"Now, we have to discuss how to deal with the situation at hand. What should be done to save our sixty face as much as possible. Teachers, do you think I am right?" Jin Deng crossed his fingers and sat in front of the central seat of the conference room and said slowly.</p>

    <p>"The vice-principal is absolutely right. But this Crazy Dai is really difficult to deal with..." Teacher Pan responded: "Director Wang and Principal Chen are both going to the city for a meeting. I heard they won't be back for another week. If Dai Tianchun comes to kill..."</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry. I'm still here."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng smiled slightly and said: "The principal is not here. I am still here. If you all agree, then this time I will fight in place of Principal Chen..."</p>

    <p>"Lao Na?"</p>

    <p>"Oh no. I mean. Poor monk..."</p>

    <p>"Poor monk?"</p>

    <p>"Uh, I'm sorry. Everyone, there have been too many TV dramas about Shaolin Temple recently... Anyway, what I meant was that I would replace Principal Chen in the battle." Monk Jin Deng said to everyone.</p>

    <p>In the conference room, all the teachers present looked at each other in confusion. They only knew that the new vice principal Huo Ding had a strong ability in teaching mathematics. But no one had ever seen him take action.</p>

    <p>"Vice Principal Huo... it's not that we don't believe you. But this is a solo battle with the principal. It's about the reputation of the school..." a teacher muttered.</p>

    <p>"I know." Monk Jin Deng nodded.</p>

    <p>"I heard that Principal Dai can do tenth level and above spells... can Vice Principal Huo do the same?"</p>

    <p>"I will not."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng smiled and said calmly and modestly: "But I can play with him."</p>
