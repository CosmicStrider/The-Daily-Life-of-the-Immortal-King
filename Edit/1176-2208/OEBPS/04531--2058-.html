  <h1>Chapter 2058 The Miracle of Dao Ancestor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The mysterious wave from the ground comes very suddenly. This is a spiritual wave that moves from far to near. It is difficult for people with low levels to detect it, because they will be swept away by this spiritual wave before they notice it and then pass out.</p>

    <p>This proves that the source of this mysterious spiritual power wave that is covered in dust is hidden deep in the ground. This also proves that it is dangerous.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't dare to be careless at all. After all, he had only fought against Xiufeng Nian before. Maybe there is a creature as dangerous as Xiufeng Nian hidden deep in the ground of this fifth map.</p>

    <p>"It's a miracle of the universe." At this time, a cold voice sounded in Wang Ling's mind. An old monk wearing white robes appeared in Wang Ling's inner world. He has a long beard. He has white hair and a boyish face that is calm and intimidating. He has a kind of immortal popularity.</p>

    <p>Although it was the first time to meet this old monk, Wang Ling still recognized the origin of this old monk at a glance.</p>

    <p>"You are. Bian Shu." Wang Ling's voice also sounded in the inner world. Directly communicate with the old monk transformed by Bian Shu.</p>

    <p>"Exactly." The old monk didn't hesitate.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling was very strong. He could see it directly, so he didn't hide anything. "The miracles of the universe are transformed by the will of the universe. They can look like anything. If you don't like how I look, I can also turn into a beautiful woman."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was speechless. He felt that this was not the point at all. It was why the Bian Shu tree appeared in his mental universe.</p>

    <p>"I know. The miracles of the universe that monks in the world are flocking to may not be anything at all in your eyes. But you rescued me anyway. I have to repay you. I also know a lot about the eternal things." The old monk who is the incarnation of the Bian Shu tree says this to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can finally see it. This is another one that relies on itself.</p>

    <p>But it's a miracle of the universe. According to normal logical thinking, the more the better. But Wang Ling is already very strong. And he needs Talisman to suppress his strength. If there are more Miracle blessing. The basic combat power may double again.</p>

    <p>"The number of miracles in the universe will not affect you. If you are unwilling to sign me, I will naturally not be able to force you. If you don't believe me, you can examine me for a while." Bian Shu replied.</p>

    <p>Then, without any further nonsense, he went straight to the point: "The miracle that is now sealed under the ground is Heavenly Dao Yun. It was originally one of the miracles under Dao Ancestor Wang. But he is quite irritable and has a very bad temper."</p>

    <p>After Bian Shu explained, Wang Ling nodded secretly. The conversation in his mental universe only lasted a moment. The changes in reality almost happened at the same time.</p>

    <p>It was a creature whose face could not be seen clearly. It had the same appearance as the Heavenly Dao Golden Men. It appeared ethereally in the fifth map. It was surrounded by large groups of clouds and mist. It was surrounded by Heavenly Dao secret mines. Each thunder represents the simultaneous bombardment of 100 Heavenly Dao. Although it does not reach the nuclear level of power, monks under the Dao Ancestor realm cannot approach it at will.</p>

    <p>"It's so noisy." The faceless man in the form of Heavenly Dao Cloud showed a bit of irritability. You can see how many red clouds are in the clouds surrounding him. They are stained with the blood of the mythical beast of the Thunder Eater. </p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling finally knows why there is a steady stream of thunder in the fifth map of the Sun family's rental land. It seems that it is all given by the Heavenly Dao cloud.</p>

    <p>And this just proves the establishment of the Sun family's ancestral land. In fact, it is also deeply related to Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>There is a mount hidden over there. Even the miracles of the universe that monks are eager to have are arranged here... Wang Ling really doesn't want these things. But can't resist being forcefully given them.</p>

    <p>Or else just ignore it?</p>

    <p>Facing Heavenly Dao Yun who kept complaining, Wang Ling didn't bother to pay attention at all. He sighed slightly. After taking the Thunder Devouring Beast into his core world, he ignored Heavenly Dao Yun and planned to move to the next one. Heading to the map.</p>

    <p>As a result, such disregard aroused Heavenly Dao Yun's dissatisfaction and rage: "You rude young man. Do you know who I am!"</p>

    <p>Obviously, the faceless creature incarnated by Heavenly Dao Yun has just woken up from a dream. He doesn't know what kind of player he is facing in front of him...</p>

    <p>This is an existence that can burn even the contract of cosmic miracles with force. Just as Bian Shu said. Wang Ling is a person who doesn't care how many cosmic miracles others have. He doesn't even put cosmic miracles at all in eyes...</p>

    <p>"You... you still dare to ignore me!"</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling resolutely ignore him and walk away. The faceless man incarnated by the Heavenly Dao cloud became even more angry. He left the clouds directly and transformed into thunder and lightning. The surrounding Heavenly Dao secret thunders all disappeared at this moment. It bloomed and swept towards Wang Ling. It wanted to kill this young man who didn't know how high the sky was.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling directly predicted all his movements, leaving only an afterimage on the spot. The faceless man's attack was very fast and violent. He quickly changed his direction. He once again attacked with an attack that was too fast to be seen by the naked eye.</p>

    <p>However, none of the attacks could hit Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is extremely embarrassing for Heavenly Dao Cloud.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't want to take action directly here. Although Heavenly Dao Yun's attack can't hurt him, the terrible force of the backlash after hitting him is enough to completely destroy the fifth map.</p>

    <p>In desperation. Wang Ling had no choice but to summon another space again!</p>

    <p>When the world of the heavens appeared, even the Heavenly Dao clouds was frightened. This was a holy land that seemed to be outlined by countless miracles. The vast and magnificent buildings were filled with brilliance. The entire sky was filled with endless divinity.</p>

    <p>This is the Heavenly City that only belongs to Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>It is the world of the heavens of Wang Ling! The most powerful alien space above the supreme world!</p>

    <p>At the moment when it was sucked into the world of the heavens. The faceless creature incarnated as a cloud in Heavenly Dao felt a steady stream of power coming from the Dao. Every building in this golden Heavenly City was glowing. The powerful law imprints on the bricks and stones echoed at this moment. Various powerful avenue powers were laid out, impacting Heavenly Dao Yun's soul.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ru, Immortal Toya, Marmot and Thunder Eater who were hidden in the core world were all dumbfounded. They had never seen such a scene before. They only felt that their three views had been refreshed again.</p>

    <p>The ability displayed by Wang Ling is too exaggerated. Even the uninvolved observers can't help but kneel down and worship at this moment.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling showed the world of the heavens for the first time, even monk Jin Deng was frightened. As a leader among the eternal ones, the sage of Buddhism who has experienced thousands of reincarnations is still like this. But that other people were even more shocked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say half a word of nonsense. The next second he raised his hand and pressed down directly. As a miracle of the universe, Heavenly Dao Yun couldn't bear the pressure at all. He knelt on the ground on the spot. The whole person was lying on the ground. He was as humble as an ugly toad...</p>
