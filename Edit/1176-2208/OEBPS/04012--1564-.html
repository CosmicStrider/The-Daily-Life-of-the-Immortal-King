  <h1>Chapter 1564 Wang Ming's charging method</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Yes, Master. I have brought back classmate Ziyi. He is a very obedient and sensible child. He has a very good temper with me."</p>

    <p>"In addition, Immortal Toya will come to your home tomorrow to perform the surgery."</p>

    <p>"Anyway, Master, please don't worry about Ziyi's situation."</p>

    <p>"All those who were under surveillance near Classmate Zhou's home were captured. None of them were let go."</p>

    <p>"Keorn from the Office of Strategic Deception has already used his previous connections in Mixiu Country to simultaneously take action against the foreign-funded companies that interfered with Jiudaohe. I believe there will be results in the near future."</p>

    <p>"In addition, there is one more thing, Master... I want to..."</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Master, let's get busy first. After Master returns to Huaxiu, I will go to your door and tell Master in person."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi never thought that one day she would be like this.</p>

    <p>You can go to Zhuo Yi's home to live for a period of time.</p>

    <p>In this world, there are two men he admires most.</p>

    <p>The first person he respected was his father.</p>

    <p>And the second one is Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The former is his life support. The latter is his spiritual support.</p>

    <p>When we were in the car earlier, he and Zhuo Yi cooperated seamlessly and had a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Zhou Ziyi really felt like Zhuo Yi's apprentice.</p>

    <p>However, Zhou Ziyi also knows it very well.</p>

    <p>Being Zhuo Yi's apprentice may be a luxury.</p>

    <p>Just a joke.</p>

    <p>Seriously. He loses.</p>

    <p>After returning to the apartment. Zhuo Yi In fact, it can be clearly noticed that Zhou Ziyi's mood seems to be slightly lower than before.</p>

    <p>He knew what was going on in the little guy's head.</p>

    <p>Actually, what I just said in the car was not all a joke.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi also has its own plans.</p>

    <p>But recruiting disciples is a big deal after all.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi cannot just accept it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this matter ultimately requires the nod of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was wearing an apron and cutting vegetables in the kitchen. At this moment, he suddenly stuck his head out and took the initiative to talk to Zhou Ziyi: "Zi Yi, can you come over and help me?"</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Zhou Ziyi, who was originally distracted, readily agreed.</p>

    <p>"Can you chop vegetables?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi moved a chair so that Zhou Ziyi could stand firmly on it.</p>

    <p>"Can."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi nodded. Even though he lost both legs, his ability to take care of himself is still very strong.</p>

    <p>Usually when Zhou Ziyi is at home alone, she cooks by herself.</p>

    <p>"Shred or dice?"</p>

    <p>"Cut the cucumber into shreds, dice the radish, and chop the pepper over there. Then help me peel it."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>"Young man is very capable." Zhuo Yi praised.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's cheeks turned red.</p>

    <p>He felt that he was hopeless.</p>

    <p>Just a simple compliment will make him feel happy.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hugged the pillow and looked in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

    <p>The look in Zhou Ziyi's eyes was slightly hostile.</p>

    <p>Earlier in the car, this little guy "teased" her with Zhuo Yi United Front. She wrote down this account...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi pressed the remote control. On the surface, he pretended that nothing happened, but in his heart he was very irritable.</p>

    <p>I didn't watch any programs.</p>

    <p>When the program jumped to the "TV Drama Channel", a very familiar line came out: "What you lost was just two legs. But what she lost was love!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, the Jiudaohe National Closed-door Competition for College Students is finally about to begin.</p>

    <p>The prize for the first place is one million Sun Island coins.</p>

    <p>Converted into Huaxiu's Chinese currency. According to the exchange rate, it is approximately equal to more than 60,000.</p>

    <p>This bonus may not seem like much to others, but it is particularly important to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The players who can be shortlisted for this competition as delegations from each school. Their overall strength and family conditions are not too bad.</p>

    <p>Except for Wang Ling, almost no one goes there for the bonus.</p>

    <p>Personal honor and school honor are more important.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Office Ueki Kimisan is worried about the public opinion that started to erupt today.</p>

    <p>There was a vague suspicion in his mind. He knew who was behind the scenes...</p>

    <p>"Zhou Xiang..." Ueki Kimisan thought about it. This was the only person he could think of.</p>

    <p>To untie the bell, one must tie the bell. If this matter is to be reversed in public opinion, the only way is to ask Zhou Xiang to make concessions and speak for the Academic Affairs Office.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Ueki Kimisan was actually well prepared.</p>

    <p>As the phone rang. Ueki Kimisan finally waited for the signal to take action.</p>

    <p>"Are you all ready?"</p>

    <p>"very good..."</p>

    <p>"Then, let's invite Teacher Zhou Xiang to my office. It's time to talk to him."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang actually didn't expect that Ueki Kimisan would find him so quickly.</p>

    <p>But this time, his confidence was different. In the past, his biggest worry was his son.</p>

    <p>Now. Zhou Ziyi's problem has been completely solved.</p>

    <p>He has nothing to fear anymore.</p>

    <p>After being connected by Miss Sun, the resources his son will enjoy in the future are probably something Ueki Kimisan would never have imagined in his wildest dreams.</p>

    <p>And now behind Zhou Xiang, Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception have joined forces to support him.</p>

    <p>One is a large-scale elixir consortium with a worldwide reputation. The other is a super sect that has emerged in recent years, is backed by an official background, and is recognized globally.</p>

    <p>After he returns to Huaxiu this time, he will also be directly hired by the Office of Strategic Deception. He will go to the Office of Strategic Deception to teach Chinese.</p>

    <p>That salary is twenty times higher than the price offered by Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>Not only that...</p>

    <p>The person in charge of the connection at the Office of Strategic Deception also promised that he would be given a special mountain to teach him. In the future, in addition to teaching Chinese courses, he would also pass on knowledge about the history of cultivation.</p>

    <p>This is a course specially opened for children who have no talent but want to contribute to the cause of human cultivation.</p>

    <p>It's not just the Office of Strategic Deception. Other schools actually have similar courses and teachers who specialize in this area of knowledge.</p>

    <p>Cultivation is not just about improving your realm and knowing how to use various gorgeous spells and magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Passing down the cultivation culture and historical heritage is also a very important part.</p>

    <p>As far as the modern cultivator profession is concerned, those historical masters who have a certain reputation, even if their cultivation level is very low or even have no cultivation level, as long as they have made achievements in the history and culture of cultivation.</p>

    <p>The treatment they receive is actually no worse than those of high-level cultivators.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception is a sect that has blossomed in all aspects. The Chinese language coursework and the history coursework have already been in the preparation process. It's just that Zhou Xiang's appearance just accelerated the process.</p>

    <p>Of course. We can offer Zhou Xiang such conditions without any worries.</p>

    <p>It's not just because he wants Zhou Xiang to make a decision to take sides as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>It's Zhou Xiang himself. He is indeed a talent worthy of spending these resources.</p>

    <p>Once again, we came to Ueki Kimisan's office. Zhou Xiang was obviously more confident.</p>

    <p>He no longer bows his head like those social beasts. He keeps his head bowed to accept all kinds of contemptuous looks from Ueki Kimisan.</p>

    <p>After entering the office, he sat directly on the sofa with his legs crossed, looking fearless.</p>

    <p>This move surprised both Ueki Kimisan and Holland, the board member of the foreign-owned group next to him.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan immediately sneered: "Teacher Zhou, are you already planning to break the pot?"</p>

    <p>He obviously didn't ask anything. Zhou Xiang actually showed such an attitude in front of him.</p>

    <p>This gave Ueki Kimisan the answer to his doubts.</p>

    <p>"You secretly spread a religious organization that is not in line with the school's culture... and you are suspected of illegally spreading religious beliefs! According to the laws of this country, you can be detained!" Ueki Kimisan threatened.</p>

    <p>"Religious organization?" Zhou Xiang couldn't help but laugh: "Gray Cult. Except for the word "religion", which is written the same as "religion", what else does it have to do with a religious organization? It is just a student literary club."</p>

    <p>"Do you think your clever words are useful? Zhou Xiang!"</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan snorted: "If you are criminally detained for breaking the law, you will also face dismissal from the school. Your income will be gone. What will your disabled son do? Have you ever thought about it?"</p>

    <p>"So. You're threatening me with my son?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhou Xiang could only lament his decisiveness in making the decision.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Jisaki found him in advance and expressed to him the willingness to cooperate between Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he would really be under control like he is now.</p>

    <p>His son is his destiny.</p>

    <p>But now this biggest weakness has been completely solved.</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang: "Ueki Kimisan. You are indeed a sinister person. My son often tells me that someone is watching him when he sleeps at night. It should be the person you sent, right?"</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan laughed: "Since you know my methods, I really don't know why you are still pretending to be tough here. Teacher Zhou Xiang, you can't do without the treatment Jiudaohe gives you..."</p>

    <p>"Then you might as well make another call and ask if the people you sent to follow are still there." Zhou Xiang spread his hands indifferently.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan frowned slightly when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He thought of Zhou Xiang's unusually tough performance today. For a moment, he was really worried about the situation over there.</p>

    <p>Probably not...</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan thought worriedly.</p>

    <p>He clearly just had a phone call with the spy over there. He said that the situation over there has been brought under control.</p>

    <p>At this moment, with a somewhat doubtful look, Ueki Kimisan called back again.</p>

    <p>The person who answered the phone was none other than Zhuo Yi: "Hello Mr. Ueki Kimisan! Is there anything else? The situation is under control!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Ueki Kimisan just realized that the accent of the person who answered the phone seemed wrong: "Your voice is not a voice I am familiar with..."</p>

    <p>"I'm new here."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was cooking while replying: "I was on the phone with you just now."</p>

    <p>"So the situation... is resolved?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Mr. Ueki. It's all solved."</p>

    <p>"Then why Zhou Xiang..."</p>

    <p>"But. It's your people who have been dealt with."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"My wife is waiting for me to cook. Don't disturb me if you have nothing to do."</p>

    <p>"??"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled: "Oh, by the way. The few people you sent are now being held in Songhai City Number 1 Prison. If you don't believe it, just call and ask yourself. They are probably not guilty of espionage. I won't be able to get out for more than ten years."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>At this point, the call is interrupted...</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan hung up the phone and showed an expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>Damn it!</p>

    <p>What on earth did this guy Zhou Xiang do...</p>

    <p>"Who is supporting you..." Ueki Kimisan was shaking with anger.</p>

    <p>This feeling of being teased made him furious. He stared at Zhou Xiang, with resentment in his eyes: "You think, even if you save your son, you can still leave this Sun Island alive."</p>

    <p>"Why. Jiudaohe's Academic Affairs Office still plans to take action against me, a people's teacher?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang stood up, with a bit of joking on his face. He patted the dust on his pants and walked straight out the door: "If you want to do something to me, please feel free. But I would like to advise Teacher Ueki Kimisan. It's better to stop as soon as possible." Don't ask for trouble."</p>

    <p>"How can you live without Jiudaohe?"</p>

    <p>"How to live? Hawk Tuah!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang raised an eyebrow. His throat trembled. He left a spit on the floor of the Registrar's Office: "Resignation letter. I've already dropped it in the mailboxes of the Registrar's Office and the Principal's Office. You make me feel sick."</p>

    <p>"You wait for Zhou Xiang! I won't make it easy for you!" Ueki Kimisan stamped his feet angrily.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Dongfu City Football Stadium.</p>

    <p>This time, the closed-door ranking competition for high school students from 100 universities across the country will be held here.</p>

    <p>All delegations have their own waiting lounges.</p>

    <p>Before the start of the game, Wang Ming reconfirmed the disposable Talisman on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Talisman currently has 66 cards left in normal operation. He judged that it shouldn't be a problem to survive the game.</p>

    <p>"If you feel something is wrong, just dodge first. Don't worry about anything, you know. I will use brain waves to clear the memories of everyone here." Wang Ming told Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He discovered that since Wang Ming and Zhai Yin got close, this guy's brain waves were becoming more and more versatile.</p>

    <p>But let me tell you something. Since confirming the relationship, Wang Ming's brain waves have indeed become much stronger than before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling speculates that this should be the result of men in love. Adrenal hormones and male hormones are constantly stimulated.</p>

    <p>In addition, the effects of brain waves during the day and brain pad waves at night have made his useless brother become more powerful than before.</p>

    <p>"Why do you look more nervous than Ling Ling?" Zhai Yin couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>It's not a public place now. So she still maintains her original appearance.</p>

    <p>Mainly because of the previous disguise of Sun Rong. All performances are too unnatural. It can almost be said to be full of loopholes.</p>

    <p>So for the sake of safety, Zhai Yin discussed with Sun Rong. In a private setting, Zhai Yin should be himself... to adjust his mentality.</p>

    <p>If it is Sun Rong's turn to come forward, Zhai Yin can use the magic weapon of dressing up to complete the disguise with one click.</p>

    <p>"Of course I'm nervous! The main reason is that I'm afraid that Ling Ling will make a mistake. What if I accidentally use an extra billion points of power and wipe this Sun Island off the satellite map."</p>

    <p>"Is it that exaggerated..."</p>

    <p>"No, Yinzi. I want you to recharge my batteries..." Wang Ming took a deep breath. He hugged Zhai Yin's waist and rested his head on Zhai Yin's chest.</p>

    <p>And this... is the legendary brain pad wave human body charger...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, who was pretending to be Jiugong Liangzi next to him, looked envious.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jisaki pushed in the door with Ohno Dankaede, Kongque and Hattori Zentetsu who were out to inquire for information.</p>

    <p>"Everyone! Are you ready?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki said: "The results of the draw have been decided. There are 100 delegations participating this time. The total number of people is 500. Half of them will be eliminated in the first round. According to the order, the Houlang Sang competition will start first. The person I'm playing against is Sakai Kazuya from Kuwada High School."</p>

    <p>"This last name sounds familiar?" Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"That's right! This Sakai Kazuya is actually the younger brother of Sakai Toyotoshi, the enemy who was forced to give away the purple cherry blossoms earlier."</p>

    <p>Jisaki couldn't help laughing: "The key is in the afternoon. Sakai Kazuya also joined the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
