  <h1>Chapter 1704 The Cemetery in the Sky</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Baobai Group. Neither Wang Ling nor Wang Ying had heard of this company before. It was like it appeared out of thin air.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used his mobile phone to check the industrial and commercial information about this company on the Internet. As a result, no such company was found. He immediately had an idea in his mind.</p>

    <p>It turns out. This is a hidden aerial company.</p>

    <p>And judging from the internal scale described by the courier boy, this Baobai company seems to have reached a certain scale. It was not established in a hurry recently. There are many employees inside, and they all wear thick white chemical protective suits. From the description, it sounds a bit like a company engaged in the cultivation of chemical industry.</p>

    <p>Regarding that memory, the courier boy tried his best to answer: "I saw...a huge cemetery..."</p>

    <p>"Graveyard? In the air?" Wang Ying and Wang Ling were both startled.</p>

    <p>"No. It's a tomb of graves! In the core area of this company's floating boat, behind an encrypted iron door, there is a huge aerial cemetery. It seems like something is being excavated."</p>

    <p>"Yes! That's right. I remembered! There is a huge skeleton in the center. It looks like a big creature. But I can't tell what it is! The tail alone is several feet high. The nameplate on it is engraved with SCB Special The word faction..."</p>

    <p>Is it to shelter living beings?</p>

    <p>This answer made Wang Ling slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>Because it is in the Minature Corpse Map. He has asked Li Xian and Zhang Zhui to lock up all the sheltered creatures that Master Wu Xin has hidden while traveling in the universe.</p>

    <p>The strongest ones among them. Except for 096, who became the rabbit who guards the backyard of the Wang Ling family. 005, 007 and 009, the sheltered creatures of the old faction, are still kept by him in King's Eyes and cannot move. And they are very well-behaved.</p>

    <p>"Go to sleep."</p>

    <p>After the interrogation was almost completed, Death Heavenly Dao snapped his fingers, making the courier boy forget everything. At the same time, he also set the miserable couple next to him to a timed resurrection state that would automatically resurrect after half an hour.</p>

    <p>Of course when the dead are resurrected, if this matter is leaked, it will definitely cause an uproar. Death Heavenly Dao's death. Death Heavenly Dao has ordered several young Golden Men to come over and deal with the aftermath.</p>

    <p>Give everyone who knows about this matter a "beating blow." Let them physically forget all memories about this matter.</p>

    <p>In addition, for the little girl who was invaded by the thought plague in this car accident, Death Heavenly Dao has also ordered the heavens to temporarily clear the memory of this poor couple having a daughter.</p>

    <p>When the little girl returns later, they will automatically recall it.</p>

    <p>After arranging everything, Deathly Heavenly Dao looked at Wang Ling and Wang Ying. He said worriedly: "Ling Zhenren, Ying Zhenren. I don't think this matter is that simple. The creatures contained in the Old Faction and the Dao Faction have all been collected. Under Ling Zhenren's control, new sheltered creatures have appeared. It's really a bit weird."</p>

    <p>"What do you think?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao took a deep breath and said: "From the perspective of the whole thing, there are at least three participants in this matter. One is the immortal Xiaoqiang, Bai Zhe. The second is Fenmu Shen. The third is Master Wu Xin. He should not be completely dead. There are many ways to survive for such an eternal person. As long as Master Wu Xin separates a trace of brain waves before death, there is a certain probability of survival."</p>

    <p>"So you said, this is the Avengers? That's interesting." Wang Ying curled his lips.</p>

    <p>He thought of these little heroes who had been shot to death gathering together again to discuss a plan on how to deal with Wang Ling. The ugly look really made people feel funny.</p>

    <p>"Although we still don't know what the purpose of these three people is, if they decide to join forces, I think they should not be underestimated. We must not underestimate the enemy." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"No matter how many people there are, what's the use? I can deal with them by myself and kill them just like killing ants." Wang Ying sneered. He didn't take such a coalition at all. The main reason was that he was very confident in his own methods. The difference between his combat power and Wang Ling is not too big. It just lacks King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, killing these three weak clowns is enough.</p>

    <p>"That's what they say. But we still have to figure out their ultimate purpose."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao analyzed rationally: "First of all, what is this Baobai Group doing? Judging from the description of this courier guy, this company is very large and has many employees. It is not a short period of time. The formation can be completed. The opponent is in the cemetery behind the iron gate in the core area. What exactly is he digging? This is also a question."</p>

    <p>"The second thing is what they currently have control over. What exactly is the special faction that takes in the creatures? I think finding out the creatures that this special faction takes in is the key."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao's analysis is clear and logical. The above questions are naturally recognized by Wang Ling. But there is one thing that is beyond Wang Ling's expectation, that is, Death Heavenly Dao's response to these "Avengers" behind this analysis.</p>

    <p>That Bai Zhe...</p>

    <p>Even though all world lines have been erased by him, he still exists.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used to think that he was the only monster.</p>

    <p>But now he discovers that in a sense, this haunting Bai Zhe is also a monster.</p>

    <p>If it's a positive encounter this time.</p>

    <p>He will definitely find a way to completely wipe him out and avoid future troubles.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, the idea now is very clear. That is to find the little girl who was invaded by the thought plague. Chen Xiaomu.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, inside the floating boat of the Baobai Group, a hidden plan was also quietly underway.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming appears here. But at this moment, he is no longer Wang Ming. His eyes are cloudy. His pupils are scattered into the shape of tentacles. He has clearly become the puppet of the thought plague.</p>

    <p>He stood in a huge cemetery. There were countless people in white wearing thick protective clothing using land reclamation shovels, gold brushes and various sophisticated scanning equipment to conduct exploration and excavation at the site.</p>

    <p>"The new special containment creature skeleton SCB 0.1598 has been discovered. Please seal the team to prepare! The aura of the skeleton is very strong. Also ask the demolition team to prepare for explosion protection! Build a barrier! Everyone must act quickly!"</p>

    <p>"yes!"</p>

    <p>In an instant, dozens of Baibao Group employees responded in unison.</p>

    <p>"People of Baobai, you are about to witness a history that is great enough to be remembered by the world!"</p>

    <p>The firelight enveloped Wang Ming's face, illuminating his cheeks red. He said excitedly with a strong desire for revenge on his face.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had miscalculated.</p>

    <p>He never thought that his body would be controlled by him. Although he had the help of Fenmu Shen and Bai Zhe, he got a new body and had a mind with great development potential.</p>

    <p>All he needs to do is inject a trace of the brain waves of the God Brain into it. In time, he will obtain a brain more powerful than the God Brain!</p>

    <p>Although it is not his style to rely on others, Master Wu Xin clearly knows that if we do not join forces at this moment, we will not be able to deal with that terrible man on the earth.</p>

    <p>"You three, you wouldn't have thought of it, would you? You pretended to be close to me and tried to get into Baobai. But I have already calculated this step." Wu Xin stared at Wang Ming's body in front of him, being put on the torture rack. Three people. Li Xian, Zhang Zhui and Zhai Yin...</p>

    <p>Among them, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were seriously injured. Although they did not feel much pain, they did not expect that their plan to enter Baobai would be directly defeated.</p>

    <p>At the same time, what they didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>In this sky cemetery. The targets excavated by these Baobai employees...</p>

    <p>It was a special kind of eternal creature from the beginning of chaos.</p>

    <p>And they have also had a loud and domineering name throughout their long history.</p>

    <p>Call it... The Dragon!</p>
