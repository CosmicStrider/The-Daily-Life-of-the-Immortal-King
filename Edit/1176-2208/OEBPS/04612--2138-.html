  <h1>Chapter 2138 Gray Mist Erosion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base. Shou Chong still has doubts about the existence of this layer of gray fog and the purpose of Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>"I don't know if there is any way to extract and analyze the material in this layer of gray fog. It may be useful for our research." Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how Bai Zhe managed to implant this layer of non-virtual fog into the virtual game world. He didn't know what the true appearance of this layer of fog was.</p>

    <p>But with the rigor and exploration spirit of modern cultivation science, he still hopes to extract some gray mist for ingredient research.</p>

    <p>He knows very well. This thing is dangerous.</p>

    <p>But he feels that this layer of gray fog may be useful for the Black Stone and subsequent Talisman.</p>

    <p>"This battle is the last one, right?" Shou Chong asked. The emotions in his heart were very complicated.</p>

    <p>The last battle he was talking about was the battle of destiny that Wang Ling had predicted. And this battle was inevitable. The entire earth and all cultivators could not ignore it.</p>

    <p>This is a battle for the fate of modern human monks. That is why everyone must unite to deal with the invasion from the outside world.</p>

    <p>"Whether this is the final battle is unclear, but whether this battle can be a resounding victory ultimately depends on whether the leaders of some cultivation nations can let go of their stubbornness and prejudice, and truly consider the interests of all cultivators, instead of being self-centered and treating everyone else as a potential enemy."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "If this kind of persecution paranoia seems to be so stubborn that it has not been changed from beginning to end because of the selfishness of some leaders. Even without this battle of destiny, modern human monks will eventually be destroyed by their own hands."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's words can be said to be very heavy.</p>

    <p>The entire Karma Base fell into silence and thinking.</p>

    <p>But it is indeed something worth thinking about.</p>

    <p>"I hope things get better." Shou Chong sighed.</p>

    <p>He is not an optimist, but he feels that no matter how difficult it is, as long as everyone has the same goal, there will always be a solution.</p>

    <p>Humanity's modern cultivation civilization has not yet reached the level of high-level civilization. Looking at the entire universe, it is as small as a drop in the ocean.</p>

    <p>The existence of the Eternal Black Stone is incredible enough.</p>

    <p>There are also the Palace of the Outer Gods, the Cosmic Embryo, the Divine Brain, and various eternal beings and unknown things. After learning about these things, Shou Chong himself did not know whether the modern scientific cultivation civilization had progressed or regressed compared to the past.</p>

    <p>Everything is indescribable and difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>But no matter how confusing it is, someone has to find the right path.</p>

    <p>"Lingling will find a solution."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's attitude is very clear.</p>

    <p>He believed in Wang Ling from the beginning.</p>

    <p>You can only believe Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He believes Director Wang will not disappoint him.</p>

    <p>And he, like Shou Chong, is somewhat interested in the nature of the gray mist. This mysterious object that can be generated directly from the virtual game world without concealing the truth is like a method only possessed by outside gods.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming himself is not a cultivator and does not understand cultivation. But he has seen a lot, so he has his own guesses.</p>

    <p>"It stands to reason that it should be impossible for Bai Zhe not to notice that Ling Zhenren is also in the game world."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was suspicious: "This game is not authenticated by real-name authentication?"</p>

    <p>"It's true that it is real-name authentication. But Lingling and Miss Rong are not old enough after all. There is a time limit. But in order to ensure that the actions of the wall breaker are accurate, so the real-name registration of the two of them is mine and Yinzi's."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Shou Chong suddenly understood. He now understood why Bai Zhe dared to arrange this layer of gray fog in such a big way even though he knew that Wang Ling was also in the game world.</p>

    <p>Emotionally, he feels that there is no threat in this virtual world. That's why he is so brave!</p>

    <p>But in the end, it is human beings who are not as good as God.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. When Wang Ling realized that this layer of faint gray mist erosion would materialize all the players in the Itinerant Immortal game world.</p>

    <p>He has already started his own chess game in his mind. He is just an ordinary high school student.</p>

    <p>Being new to the world, he just casually saved the earth a few times.</p>

    <p>But even so, he also knows that he needs to take the initiative in his own hands at all times.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao reincarnation. Those who lose will eventually shoot themselves in the foot.</p>

    <p>To be honest, after several battles with Bai Zhe, Wang Ling found that Bai Zhe has indeed improved a lot than before. He has become more patient. He is no longer the one who always rushed forward as soon as he gained strength. A reckless man who thought he was invincible and then was beaten by his own tricks.</p>

    <p>He has now learned to test. And his offensive ideas are very novel. He can be said to be a good opponent.</p>

    <p>But between universes, sometimes there is a restrained relationship.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't mean to target Bai Zhe. But the principle of enemies crossing paths is indeed very metaphysical sometimes.</p>

    <p>A strange gray fog that can transform the virtual world into the real world.</p>

    <p>This reminded Wang Ling of his own King's Eyes' "eight-character pupil technique."</p>

    <p>It's the method of "there is something and there is nothing. Virtual and real complement each other" that he used before. It can turn reality into illusion and illusion into reality.</p>

    <p>This ability is too terrifying. Wang Ling has only used it a few times in total. The last time it was used was in Chapter 1520...</p>

    <p>The reason why the essence of this gray mist is higher than the wall of spiritual consciousness is not just because it allows trapped players to immerse themselves in the world and think that it is all just a game.</p>

    <p>At the same time, virtuality is transformed into reality. This is the terrible thing about gray fog erosion.</p>

    <p>According to Wang Ling's judgment. This is most likely Fenmu Shen's method. It's too similar to an outside god.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe just provides a spatial medium that can realize gray fog.</p>

    <p>Now that it has been determined that this is a thing of an alien god, Wang Ling has an idea.</p>

    <p>The current fog concentration is obviously not that high. This is Bai Zhe's side stalling. Waiting for more players to come online and join the game world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Mixiu monks who were coordinated by Tiandaoyun to enter the game world via the cloud.</p>

    <p>The total number of players has exceeded 10 million people.</p>

    <p>Compared to the entire modern cultivation world, this number of players may not be worth mentioning. However, these 10 million closed beta players are all carefully screened by Bai Qiao. A considerable number of them are the mainstay of the modern cultivation world.</p>

    <p>If even these people are trapped, once irreversible damage occurs, it will inevitably affect the real world.</p>

    <p>These such influences Wang Ling has been considered. Therefore, it is impossible for him to let Bai Zhe's plan succeed.</p>

    <p>But at the moment, in order to avoid unnecessary alarm, he can only pretend not to notice. He is addicted to the game world.</p>

    <p>Anyway.</p>

    <p>Stable development is definitely the top priority right now.</p>

    <p>...</p>
