  <h1>Chapter 1696 Birthday Surprise and New Year Surprise</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The external fortifications were completed. Wang Ling just breathed a sigh of relief. This ensured that Father Wang and Mother Wang would be safe as long as they stayed inside the house when the enemy attacked.</p>

    <p>The current Wang family's villa is like a fort. What comes out is the word tyranny.</p>

    <p>No matter who comes, they can hit him like a tiger or a tiger, or hit him like a catastrophe.</p>

    <p>Throughout the whole process, Ah Nuan was obediently lying on Wang Ling's shoulder and watching. This little girl likes to stick to herself. And Wang Ling was also the first time that Wang Nuan felt a sense of touch with other people. A different emotion felt.</p>

    <p>He didn't reject it. This was the most incredible thing for him.</p>

    <p>But in fact Wang Ling didn't take long. I figured it out in my own way.</p>

    <p>Because Ah Nuan girl is his biological sister whose blood is thicker than water. She is one of the most important people to him, so he will not reject her.</p>

    <p>The most important person...</p>

    <p>When I think about it at this point, Wang Ling feels that on this birthday of this year, I seem to have a whole new thought.</p>

    <p>For a long time he would never think about other people's affairs.</p>

    <p>But now, when he realizes how important the people close to him are, he suddenly feels the need to protect these important people...</p>

    <p>These people should not just refer to his relatives.</p>

    <p>He admitted that he was somewhat conflicted now.</p>

    <p>Because according to his consistent logic, it seems that only if these people do not exist can he enjoy the calm, peaceful and peaceful life that he longs for.</p>

    <p>But now that kind of life seems to be getting further and further away from him.</p>

    <p>And he also became... more and more accustomed to...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Towards the evening of that day, there were a dozen familiar figures approaching the Wang family's villa. These dozen people were divided into two groups. One group was led by Chen Chao, and the other group was led by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>As the best brother of Wang Ling in Number 60 High School. There is no reason not to give gifts to brothers on their birthdays.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao have all prepared their own gifts.</p>

    <p>Previously, the class also issued a list of gifts for Wang Ling. This was asked by Chen Chao privately one by one. Then he put them all together and distributed them to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Usually because Wang Ling is taciturn, there are not many people who have a real good relationship with Wang Ling. Logically speaking, Wang Ling would not receive too many gifts.</p>

    <p>But this time the gift list is unexpectedly rich...</p>

    <p>"Why are there so many people?"</p>

    <p>When Guo Hao saw this full list, he was a little dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"Because many people have heard that Wang Ling is a mascot... Giving gifts to the mascot is a tribute that can enhance your European style in a sense." Su Xiao said.</p>

    <p>"This is true. But in fact, the situation is more complicated than we imagined."</p>

    <p>"complex?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't you see that there are many foreign workers in the gift list? They usually have nothing to do with Wang Ling. How can they give gifts for no reason?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! How strange!"</p>

    <p>"It's not surprising at all. I think these people are most likely to join Gray Cult." Chen Chao spread his hands and said.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Su Xiao nodded almost at the same time.</p>

    <p>They may not believe what others say, but Chen Chao's mouth is not sealed.</p>

    <p>Can't help but believe it.</p>

    <p>Of course, although many people give gifts, the gifts themselves are not that expensive gadgets.</p>

    <p>We are all high school students. The gift is just a heartfelt gift. Not everyone can treat the aircraft carrier as a gift like the Sun Rong family.</p>

    <p>So when school was over that day, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao acted as representatives to deliver the gifts directly to the door of the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>They thought that Sun Rong would also come, but surprisingly Sun Rong declined the invitation and disappeared as soon as the school day ended.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao felt that it wasn't that Sun Rong didn't want to give gifts to Wang Ling, she obviously had her own ideas!</p>

    <p>I just don't know what Sun Rong wants to do...</p>

    <p>With the financial resources of Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>As long as money can buy anything in this world, there is nothing that cannot be bought. However, Chen Chao felt that Sun Rong definitely did not want to give such an insincere gift.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "What do you think Sun Rong will give Wang Ling? It won't be a house, will it? If you give a house directly, then I would be a good friend, ... good friend, how many years less will I have to struggle?"</p>

    <p>"The house shouldn't be that big. This gift is too expensive. Wang Ling may not accept it."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao said: "And this is a very tacky gift. To the rich, a house is not a house at all, it's just a playing card. When I went to the exchange meeting of the 59th middle school, I personally saw three girls bring their real estate certificates to the game of "Fight the Landlord." Have you ever seen a straight flush from the first to the ninth ring?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Didn't know this kind of thing existed at all.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes of silence, Chen Chao said again: "I don't think Sun Rong will give away the house either, it's too ridiculous. It's not like she's getting married. Even if she were to give away a house, she'd have to find a way to gift herself out first!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao, Su Xiao understood again.</p>

    <p>So, that's what it is?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong wants to gift himself away!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, another team headed by Zhuo Yi approached the Wang family villa from different directions. Sun Rong was very nervous along the way. Just ordering special noodles last night cost a lot of money. Less time. It took a lot of effort to catch up.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is actually the gift box that contains her gift. The style of the gift box Sun Rong was also chosen for a long time.</p>

    <p>She and the courier who delivered the gift box agreed to meet at this time in front of the Wang family's villa. Everything else had been taken care of.</p>

    <p>"Master's wife, there's no need to be so nervous. You have to relax a little. In this case, I can also relax a little." Zhuo Yi consoled her: "I'll send you a gift box with those crispy noodles later, Master's wife." time. I will do my best to disconnect King's Eyes' ability to remove falsehood and preserve truth."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was really nervous.</p>

    <p>After all, this kind of behavior does have the meaning of "deceiving the master and destroying the ancestor"...</p>

    <p>"Who is your Master's wife..." Sun Rong blushed and quickly used a cooling spell on herself.</p>

    <p>After her mind calmed down a bit, she frowned slightly again.</p>

    <p>Because the person who sent the gift box hasn't arrived yet.</p>

    <p>She is quite ready on her own.</p>

    <p>It was just as planned from the beginning. Monk Jin Deng prepared a lot of blessed gold charms for her. All she had to do was wait for her to get into the gift box and stick it all over her body.</p>

    <p>In order to customize the gift box, Zhuo Yi knew that Sun Rong also put in a lot of effort.</p>

    <p>After all, there is a person inside the gift box.</p>

    <p>But when I went shopping yesterday, most of the surprise gift boxes containing people looked like coffins for some reason...</p>

    <p>So in the end there was no choice. Sun Rong had no choice but to take the customization route.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi I heard that this gift box was customized by Sun Rong by a skilled craftsman. It doesn't look like a coffin at all. And it is very artistic!</p>

    <p>"Is that the guy with the red hat?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi saw a courier guy from a distance.</p>

    <p>Pulling a big box and riding an electric tricycle slowly coming from a distance...</p>

    <p>And through King's Eyes. Zhuo Yi can easily see what the inside of the box looks like. This customized gift box.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he gasped: "Hiss..."</p>

    <p>This gift box...</p>

    <p>Charming is good enough.</p>

    <p>It was made of metal, with perfect curves, and it really didn't look like a coffin at all. It was completely customized for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But the problem is...</p>

    <p>This gift box is special. It is shaped like a human!</p>
