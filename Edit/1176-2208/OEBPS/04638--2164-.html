  <h1>Chapter 2164 Brave Rongrong is not afraid of difficulties</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Habitually keep a distance. This is Wang Ling's regular practice since he has been single for nearly seventeen years.</p>

    <p>But now Wang Ling has gradually discovered that there are very few existences that seem to be special cases. Especially since entering Number 60 High School. There are more and more such special cases. It is almost out of control. to the point...</p>

    <p>If Chen Chao and Guo Hao weren't still undergoing secret training, they would probably have joined this adventure in the Itinerant Immortal game world adventure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is unsure if there are any exceptional cases among the exceptional cases, but he believes that Sun Rong is at least one of the exceptional cases for now.</p>

    <p>She can always help him.</p>

    <p>It is true that she helped him solve many problems.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has nothing to offer in return. He can only enlighten one White Rabbit toffee after another or an enlightened version of crispy noodles as a return gift.</p>

    <p>However, the girl rarely seemed to eat the food he gave... According to information that Sun Ying'er revealed to Wang Ying, and Wang Ying then revealed to himself.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong specially opened a safe in the bank to hide the enlightened snacks he gave. And the insured amount was very high... It was almost the girl's pocket money for several months.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little distressed after hearing this. One billion a month of pocket money. The insured amount is for several months.</p>

    <p>How much crispy noodles could he buy?</p>

    <p>Right now Wang Ling feels a little hesitant about his actions.</p>

    <p>He could easily destroy a planet with a mere gesture, but he never imagined that facing a girl would make this door so much heavier than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>So this time, it was too difficult for Wang Ling, who never took the initiative, to open the door.</p>

    <p>Just when he was struggling, the girl outside the door took a deep breath and made the decision first and decisively.</p>

    <p>After a loud murmur of "Brave Rongrong is not afraid of difficulties", Wang Ling saw the door being pushed open directly by Sun Rong. The force was extremely strong. It hit him in the face. It left the humanoid outline of Wang Ling on the door.</p>

    <p>"General... are you okay?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't expect Wang Ling to be standing behind the door when she opened the door. This operation shocked her.</p>

    <p>The direct consequence is that the main hall gate lost 10,000 HP</p>

    <p>General lost 0.00001 HP</p>

    <p>She originally came to woo the general. Unexpectedly, she just entered the door and completed a wave of door-opening kills, ambushing the general.</p>

    <p>For a moment Sun Rong suddenly panicked.</p>

    <p>At the door. When Lao Huang saw this scene, he held his forehead and sighed. The expression on his face was that he couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>This is obviously not a way to conquer... this is to assassinate the general!</p>

    <p>It's really Li Liyuan's masterpiece!</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling also has to admit that he made some mistakes...</p>

    <p>He didn't expect the girl to be so brave. And she was much more powerful than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Although he was not hurt at all when the door was blown down. He almost stood there motionless. However, his whole body was suddenly thrown into disarray.</p>

    <p>This directly gave Sun Rong the opportunity to approach him directly.</p>

    <p>Worried that her actions might lower his favorability, Sun Rong immediately grabbed Wang Ling's shoulders and started shaking him after entering the door.</p>

    <p>"General... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I really didn't come to assassinate you..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>She was filled with fear.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that she didn't expect that she pushed the door a little too hard just now. After all, during the time when Wang Ling was offline, she had several more levels. The character's comprehensive attributes are no longer comparable to her own in the novice stage.</p>

    <p>Simply pushing the door can cause massive damage to the door.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong even feels a little bit of the pain that Wang Ling usually holds back...</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling is so pitiful.</p>

    <p>Has he always come here like this?</p>

    <p>He is afraid every day because he will be too strong and hurt others.</p>

    <p>He is really nice. So gentle!</p>

    <p>For a moment, Sun Rong was filled with emotions. At this moment, she was facing the general in front of her who seemed to have been completely stunned by her. She couldn't help but put the matter into Wang Ling's perspective.</p>

    <p>And it was at this time that she discovered that the General Fuyun Town mask on Wang Ling's face actually had a broken corner.</p>

    <p>What has she done...</p>

    <p>Even the general's mask was destroyed by her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had no time to think about all this.</p>

    <p>That brave Rongrong slogan of not being afraid of difficulties still echoes in my mind.</p>

    <p>Anyway, she was already reckless by opening the door this time. Even though her favorability level had been lowered, at least judging from his current performance, the general of Fuyun Town did not push her away.</p>

    <p>This shows that the favorability value she has accumulated through taking care of the town these days is still quite high.</p>

    <p>That also means that she has capital that she can continue to squander.</p>

    <p>So reckless.</p>

    <p>How about... being a little more reckless?</p>

    <p>So the next second, something unexpected happened to Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong raised her hand and lifted his mask.</p>

    <p>In the game world, Wang Ling cannot directly use spells to read minds. This directly leads to his inability to predict Sun Rong's next thought.</p>

    <p>It turned out that the girl was much bolder than he imagined.</p>

    <p>She actually raised her hand and took off his mask.</p>

    <p>This directly exposes Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>Looking at this all-too-familiar face in front of them, the two people in the General's Palace fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is thinking about words. But his mind is blank.</p>

    <p>He thought the girl would be angry. That she thought he was teasing her in this way. But to his surprise, he saw Sun Rong wiping away tears.</p>

    <p>He started to think about a big drama on my own.</p>

    <p>Tears as big as pearls rolled down the girl's cheeks.</p>

    <p>These are touching tears.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Woohoo... your initial mission. Is it... to hide your true player identity..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was stunned. Unexpectedly, Sun Rong would make up her mind like this.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong's emotion at the moment is indeed based on this basic reasoning logic.</p>

    <p>She felt that Wang Ling was usually lonely enough. This time he took the initiative to invite her to participate in the Itinerant Immortal game world. Since they met in Novice Village, there was no need to hide his identity from her.</p>

    <p>Unless you receive some initial mission, you have to hide yourself.</p>

    <p>A person who was originally very lonely. As a result, he continued to choose to play the game in a lonely way. He also silently upgraded her, built equipment, and let her manage the town... He believed in her ability so much...</p>

    <p>All of this made Sun Rong suddenly realize Wang Ling's helplessness.</p>

    <p>The immortal king's helplessness... that's it!</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, classmate Wang Ling. I was too slow... I should have unveiled your mask earlier..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shed tears of emotion while hugging Wang Ling's neck: "This way you won't feel lonely."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was just held by her.</p>

    <p>His mind is still blank...</p>

    <p>He didn't say anything at all.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect Sun Rong to come up with the story like this all by herself.</p>

    <p>As expected of the Sun family...</p>
