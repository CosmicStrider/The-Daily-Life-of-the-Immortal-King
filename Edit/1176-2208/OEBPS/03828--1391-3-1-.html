  <h1>Chapter 1391 Sun Ying'er's alias: Sun Anxiang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Old God disappeared. Her iconic red dress disappeared along with the pair of golden wings.</p>

    <p>Even the Ten Thousand Winged God ring on his head fell off.</p>

    <p>The core world was destroyed. Sun Rong and others reappeared in the ancient temple. She picked up the Ten Thousand Winged God ring that fell on the ground.</p>

    <p>For a moment, all the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube chambers began to shake as if they had been stimulated. The space walls on all sides began to squeeze along the center, and were about to shrink into a ball.</p>

    <p>Er Ha can clearly feel that there is a strong resentment at work: "It's Old God! This woman is using her residual thoughts to activate the Rubik's Cube. She plans to blow us all to death in the Rubik's Cube!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! What should we do?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er had no clue. There was no way. She could only cry with Sun Rong: "Woooo! Rongrong! I hope I can be your shadow in the next life!"</p>

    <p>"You idiot Ying'er. Don't say your last words so early..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was very calm. She looked at Er Ha: "If the Master of Shadows is here, there will be something we can do, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying had been hiding in Er Ha's shadow for a long time. Finally, she showed up at this moment. She smiled and asked, "When did you discover me?"</p>

    <p>"When Ying'er's power returns, I have already confirmed that you are with us." Sun Rong said. She looked at Wang Ying: "Can you take us out?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said confidently. After saying that, he looked at Sun Ying'er: "It's a pity. You can't be Miss Sun's shadow in the next life. Moreover, I heard the bad things you said about me before. I will deal with you after I get out." account."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>The escape route Wang Ying has already been prepared. This is the purpose of Wang Ling sending him here.</p>

    <p>So there is no need to find the exit of any secret room. This mere secret room in Heavenly Dao cannot trap Wang Ling, Wang Ying and others.</p>

    <p>Then. A dark passage opened in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"What a pity. The Heavenly Dao secret room was compressed. All the good things in the secret room were destroyed." Er Ha said sadly.</p>

    <p>"Can this be considered a good thing?" Wang Ying couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>To be precise, he felt that these things might be good things in the eyes of Old God.</p>

    <p>However, no matter in Wang Ling's eyes or in his own eyes, these things are worthless.</p>

    <p>It's really scary when a woman becomes cruel.</p>

    <p>He would actually think of the Heavenly Dao secret room that he carefully transformed to commemorate his emotional past with Dao Ancestor Wang. It was used to bury the other woman he was jealous of.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that first, Dao Ancestor Wang made a mistake.</p>

    <p>The second is that Old God still does not have a clear understanding of himself.</p>

    <p>If this Old God knew that Sun Rong was in peace, he would probably die in peace, right?</p>

    <p>After leaving the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube secret room, Sun Rong stood next to the sinkhole on the Heavenly Dao star. Staring at the abyss below. A sparkling Rubik's Cube floated up from the bottom of the abyss.</p>

    <p>What surprised Sun Rong was that the Rubik's Cube actually integrated with the Aohai in her hand.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations, Miss Sun. Your Aohai is already a dual-core spirit sword."</p>

    <p>"Aren't we going to hold an upgrade ceremony?" Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>She heard the monk mention that dual-core Aohai can exert the power of "the most powerful sword in the world!"</p>

    <p>One sword is as powerful as a hundred Alluring Swords!</p>

    <p>"The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube will attract and resonate with each other. The upgrade ceremony only needs to be performed once. It is used to fuse Aohai with the first Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube." Wang Ying replied.</p>

    <p>He stared at the dual-core Aohai in Sun Rong's hand. Feeling the powerful combat power emanating from Aohai.</p>

    <p>Sun RongThe current power of a sword. Can fight with Dao God.</p>

    <p>Under Dao God, I'm afraid no one can withstand such sword power.</p>

    <p>"I took away another Rubik's Cube. What should I do with the missing hole in this Rubik's Cube?" Sun Rong was worried.</p>

    <p>"Of course there is a way." After Wang Ying finished speaking, he took out a brand new Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube from his sleeve. This Rubik's Cube is golden yellow! It is the same color as fresh dried noodles.</p>

    <p>"Just replace it with a new one." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"This... was prepared from the beginning?"</p>

    <p>"No. It's freshly baked. The Lord just made it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It's not difficult to make. The main reason is that it's difficult to collect the materials."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said: "Monk Jin Deng is responsible for the material collection work. It takes one day to collect the materials for two Rubik's cubes. After receiving the materials, the master pinched two in an instant. One was used to fill the unspeakable place. The hole. Now this one is used to repair the Heavenly Dao star."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he dropped the golden Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube into the pit below.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Under the abyss buried by endless darkness, there was a brilliant light. Bright repairing lights gush out from the bottom of the abyss like sweet springs, repairing the loopholes in this sinkhole.</p>

    <p>The sinkhole is filling up quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye. It only takes a few tens of seconds to complete the repair.</p>

    <p>Together with the buildings that were previously affected by the sinkhole and swallowed up, they have also been completely restored.</p>

    <p>"In this way, will the imbalance of Heavenly Dao's Rubik's Cube be stopped?" At this time, Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"It's just that there will be no changes temporarily. The current nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes are there. Mutual checks and balances are not a problem. But the energy of the new Rubik's Cube is too strong. It is by no means a long-term solution. So if you want to replace it, you have to use the remaining ones. Replace all seven of them together."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said. He looked at Sun Rong: "From today on, Miss Sun's job every night is to replace the Rubik's Cube. Now your dual-core Aohai has greatly improved your combat power. And Ying' er protects you. It is also good to take advantage of the opportunity to go out and practice again."</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I'll do my best!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying found that the expression on the girl's face did not seem as happy as expected: "Is Miss Sun worried about Ajuan?"</p>

    <p>"Her soul was swallowed up by the Old God. Can classmate Wang Ling do anything?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, there is no need for the commander to take action at all." Wang Ying shook his head and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Now the Cat in the Abandoned Land is one of our own.</p>

    <p>Say hello. It's not difficult to capture Ajuan's soul.</p>

    <p>As for the soul that was devoured by the Old God, it was actually not Ajuan's complete soul. It was deliberately divided by Cat in the Abandoned Land and given to the Old God.</p>

    <p>After Ajuan's soul was divided, Cat in the Abandoned Land quickly used magic to repair the soul.</p>

    <p>Repair the soul. This is also one of the abilities of the God Spirit Column.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly felt the Ten Thousand Winged God ring on his hand tremble slightly.</p>

    <p>The curly-haired girl was like a kitten with its head stuck out of a coffee cup. She suddenly poked her head out of the divine ring: "Na na na! I'm back!"</p>

    <p>"Ajuan!" Sun Rong said in surprise.</p>

    <p>"I seem to be a little stuck..."</p>

    <p>"Wait for Ajuan." Sun Rong held Ajuan's face. Then handed the magic ring to Sun Ying'er: "Ying'er, come and help me! Let's pull Ajuan out together!"</p>

    <p>One two three!</p>

    <p>Use force!</p>

    <p>The two women worked together. Only a "squeaking" sound was heard, and the curly-haired girl was pulled out of the narrow divine ring.</p>

    <p>"Old God's divine ring. The size is too small." Ajuan rubbed her chest. This is where it was stuck just now. It was pulled out by force. It caused her chest pain.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er smiled evilly: "I didn't expect Ajuan to look young. He's quite promising, right? Listen to Old God, you are still an immortal soul. You will never grow old in your life. Aren't you the legendary legal lolita?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. The immortal soul is actually not as good as I thought. I don't know why Old God is obsessed with this." Ajuan sighed.</p>

    <p>After saying that, she bowed deeply to everyone: "Thank you for your help this time!"</p>

    <p>"Ajuan, you're welcome. What you should really thank is your classmate Wang Ling." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren's kindness will never be forgotten by Ajuan. I will definitely repay the kindness!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Ajuan raised his head and glanced at Sun Rong: "And Rongrong, don't worry. I mean repaying a favor. It's definitely not a promise of one's own body."</p>

    <p>"What the hell..." Sun Rong's face started to get a little hot again.</p>

    <p>Although she has been teased again and again these days, she still doesn't seem to get used to such teasing.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Falling in love with a piece of wood is really difficult!</p>

    <p>At this time, Ajuan said to Wang Ying. Her eyes flashed and she was lovely: "Sir Wang Ying, you and the Immortal people should go back first! I have something here that I want to give to Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>"Okay. It's getting late. Tomorrow is the resumption day of Number 60 High School. I hope Miss Sun will come back soon." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"I know!" Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's deliberate reminder of time actually has a purpose.</p>

    <p>The time now is around five o'clock on Sunday afternoon...</p>

    <p>There are still less than three hours left until the eight o'clock adjustment time every night.</p>

    <p>As long as Sun Rong returns to Earth. According to the agreement, Sun Ying'er will report to him immediately.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>You actually called him a gorilla?</p>

    <p>Then take a look at this guy. How big are the gorilla's chest muscles!</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Wang Ying glanced at Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was trembling. There was a feeling of death omens flooding between her eyebrows.</p>

    <p>In a quiet room inside the shrine.</p>

    <p>Ajuan showed Sun Rong and Sun Ying'er some things that he had collected for many years. There were magic weapons, elixirs and some beautiful clothes. These things were like treasures. Each one shone with light.</p>

    <p>Some are rare treasures obtained through Ajuan's experience, and some are inherited from the Old God.</p>

    <p>Now that the Old God is dead, Ajuan still feels a little uncomfortable when he sees these things he inherited from the Old God.</p>

    <p>"Ajuan is still thinking about Old God?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>She can actually feel it. The relationship between Ajuan and Old God is very close.</p>

    <p>But there's nothing she can do now.</p>

    <p>He could only step forward and gently put his hands on Ajuan's shoulders to give the girl some comfort.</p>

    <p>"Old God, even though she did very excessive things to me, I have always regarded her as a mother-like existence." Ajuan sighed.</p>

    <p>She opened a box. A golden feather appeared in front of the three women. This feather was like a daytime firework, shining like the sun.</p>

    <p>After Ajuan poured his own divine energy into it, the whole feather seemed to be on fire, shining with mysterious runes.</p>

    <p>A feather that looks like it is burning, but emits a cold fire that is not hot. This cold fire has the power to freeze everything.</p>

    <p>"Golden God Feather."</p>

    <p>Ajuan said: "In order to freeze her appearance, the Old God found a treasure. She tried to use the golden feather to freeze her appearance. But unfortunately, she was unable to reverse her rejuvenated physique."</p>

    <p>"These things are of great significance to you, right?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Well... it used to be! But now! I think I should look forward!"</p>

    <p>Ajuan smiled. His face was flushed. He was so cute that he wanted to kiss him: "Rongrong and Ying'er can pick these things at will!"</p>

    <p>"Ah? Is this okay?"</p>

    <p>"Why not! Whatever you like in my room is fine! Of course. Compared with the things Ling Zhenren gave you, these items of mine may not be valuable, but they are still my thoughts after all! Each of you must choose at least one item!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is a little hesitant. After all, she is not a cheap person.</p>

    <p>But Ajuan said so. She still had to give it to the King of the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>It's just that there are so many objects in front of me, which makes Sun Rong a bit dazzled. I don't know what to choose.</p>

    <p>Or just pick something that doesn't look that valuable...</p>

    <p>"What is this?" Sun Rong asked, pointing to an ugly little stone.</p>

    <p>"Na na! Rongrong has such good eyesight! This is the Holy Moon Stone! It allows the spirit beast to complete the next stage of evolution instantly! The fourth grade is upgraded to the third grade! The third grade is upgraded to the second grade!"</p>

    <p>Ajuan introduced eloquently: "If it is a first-grade spiritual beast, it can be upgraded to a holy beast! The holy beast has been extinct for a long time. There are less than three Holy Moon Stones scattered in the entire universe. This is one of them!"</p>

    <p>"I... I'd better change it to something else!" Sun Rong was shocked. I didn't expect this stone to be so valuable.</p>

    <p>Her eyes scanned the surroundings cautiously.</p>

    <p>After all, she is the rich daughter of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. This ability to recognize objects Sun Rong is almost innate... Wherever her vision reaches, there must be something valuable!</p>

    <p>And this is actually one of the reasons why the old man has a good impression of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because from her granddaughter's point of view, if she really likes a boy, then the boy is definitely a potential stock!</p>

    <p>So even though Wang Ling's information clearly states that he is just a "Foundation Building period." Mr. Boss Sun doesn't care at all.</p>

    <p>What happened to the Foundation Building period?</p>

    <p>As long as it is a boy that his granddaughter likes, he will definitely be promoted to True Immortal in the future!</p>

    <p>After observing for a long time, Sun Rong finally discovered something that he was very familiar with.</p>

    <p>"Is this the Beauty Rejuvenation Pill?" she asked, pointing to a pink pill.</p>

    <p>This elixir is placed in an ordinary-looking jar. It is almost the same as the Beauty Rejuvenation Pill refined by the Huaguo Shuilian Group. It is not strange for a girl to have a Beauty Rejuvenation Pill in her room.</p>

    <p>"No! This is the Immortal Pill! It is made with the power of my immortal soul! After eating it, you will not grow old for the rest of your life!" Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>"You will never grow old in your lifetime?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Never in my life."</p>

    <p>Ajuan nodded affirmatively: "But it's a pity. This Elixir cannot fulfill Old God's wish. Rongrong is from Earth. Elixir is just right to use on you. The divine body of Old God. Relying on Elixir cannot reverse the situation. of."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>But she still put the jar in her hand back to its original place.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Don't Rongrong want to keep his youthful appearance for the rest of his life?" Ajuan asked.</p>

    <p>She actually doesn't quite understand Sun Rong's behavior.</p>

    <p>For a girl, appearance may always be the first thing.</p>

    <p>"I think it is a very happy thing to be able to grow old slowly with the person you like." Sun Rong shook his head and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Anyway, with the strength of classmate Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>If he doesn't want to grow old, he probably won't grow old, right?</p>

    <p>"Ajuan! What is this!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Ying'er spent a long time looking around the room. Finally, he found an emerald-green stick from a box under Ajuan's bed.</p>

    <p>There are evenly distributed bumps on the stick. It looks a bit ugly and vulgar.</p>

    <p>"I remembered. This is Old God's thing!" Ajuan stared at the emerald green stick for a long time and said, "This seems to be Old God's favorite thing when he was alive. It is said to be used for massage?"</p>

    <p>Ajuan actually doesn't quite understand the purpose of this emerald green stick.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the stick is thick and short. It doesn't look like the legendary jade dog beating stick.</p>

    <p>So Ajuan thoughtfully hid the stick. Unexpectedly, Sun Ying'er discovered it now.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er... your taste is too bad. Why are you looking for weird things?" Sun Rong raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he is worthy of being her shadow.</p>

    <p>"Okay! I know there is no shortage of sticks around Rongrong." Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"What nonsense are you talking about..."</p>

    <p>"Don't Boss Sun have an ancestral stick in his hand? It will definitely be passed down to you in the future!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"..." Realizing that he had "dirty" Sun Ying'er's words, Sun Rong's face couldn't help but get hot again.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er chuckled and threw the stick on the bed.</p>

    <p>Humph! How could she still not know what her words meant?</p>

    <p>Anticipate in advance that the other party will think that he will "dirty" you. This is the highest level of teasing!</p>

    <p>"Ajuan. Don't tell me. Your Old God really has a lot of weird things."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er found herself addicted to digging under the bed.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" Sun Ying'er asked, pointing to a black pill sealed in the medicine box.</p>

    <p>"Changing Pills." Ajuan replied.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. Put it down quickly..." Sun Rong shouted.</p>

    <p>"What the hell?" Sun Ying'er had an incredulous expression.</p>

    <p>"When Old God and Dao Ancestor were in love, I would sometimes feel lonely, so I would read some romance novels. These Changing Pills are for those short authors. After taking them, the things I write become very long," Ajuan explained.</p>

    <p>After explaining. Sun Rong's face turned redder.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the way back to Earth. The temperature on Sun Rong's face never stopped...</p>

    <p>She suspected that Sun Ying'er deliberately picked some weird things to ask!</p>

    <p>After returning to Sun Rong's bedroom, Sun Ying'er was still snickering maliciously. What she likes to see most is her Rongrong's shy reactions!</p>

    <p>The weird things left by the Old God in Ajuan's room are secondary. The most important thing is Rongrong's cute reaction!</p>

    <p>"Ying'er! What are you laughing at?" Sun Rong felt that after Sun Ying'er came back, the corners of his mouth started to rise crazily and almost never stopped.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's nothing. I just thought the black shorts I just wore were pretty good. Those were Dao Ancestor Wang's underwear!" Sun Ying'er said with a pity look on his face.</p>

    <p>"Why do I need Dao Ancestor's underwear!!!" Sun Rong said in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>In fact, neither Sun Ying'er nor Sun Rong. They didn't expect that Old God actually collected Dao Ancestor's underwear...</p>

    <p>Listen to what Ajuan said. Putting on these underwear from Dao Ancestor Wang can make people's six senses pure, calm and relaxed, and calm the desires in the heart.</p>

    <p>Ever since.</p>

    <p>This pair of Dao Ancestor Wang's underwear also has an alias. It's called: Wang Zhichong.</p>

    <p>The scene became awkward for a time.</p>

    <p>In the end, Sun Rong and Sun Ying'er didn't choose anything. Sun Rong hurriedly pushed Sun Ying'er back.</p>

    <p>If you let this girl continue to dig through it, she might be able to dig out some weird things.</p>

    <p>Ajuan also realized that the room was a little messy. He agreed to leave the right to choose things next time and sent them back to the earth first.</p>

    <p>In the bedroom, Sun Ying'er leaned back on the sofa with a look of pity: "Hey, Rong Rong! I still want that pair of underwear! I really do! Look at that gorilla, Wang Ying, if he had these on , he wouldn't be so mean to me!"</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, her whole body was swept away by a black shadow again...</p>

    <p>This time. Sun Rong didn't even have time to reply.</p>

    <p>Everything happened so suddenly!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thinks that Sun Ying'er can change his name to Sun Anxiang.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, December 7th.</p>

    <p>This is the day when Number 60 High School resumes school. After everyone arrived at Number 60 High School, they were shocked by the majestic teaching building and the wide school gate in front of them!</p>

    <p>The entire Number 60 High School has been completely renovated from the inside out! It really has a completely new look. It is completely different from the old appearance before!</p>

    <p>Take the faded old stone sculpture at the main entrance of the school. After being beaten by countless wind and rain, the old stone sculpture has finally been retired. It was placed in the school history exhibition hall by Principal Chen.</p>

    <p>Now, what greets the students of Number 60 High School at the door every day is a life-size golden statue of Zhuo Yi! It is also the kind of design with a flying sword on its feet! It really gives people a sense of déjà vu as a hero has arrived and is moving forward bravely!</p>

    <p>It makes people feel excited from a distance!</p>

    <p>"I heard that the statue of senior Zhuo Yi was built a long time ago. It was originally made of gold sand. Now that our school has money, it has been changed to pure gold."</p>

    <p>"Made of gold sand? Isn't that just a sand sculpture?"</p>

    <p>The location at the school gate. Many people wearing 60 High School uniforms were discussing it.</p>

    <p>This is the resumption day of Number 60 High School. Many parents come to send their children to school in person. In fact, they mainly want to see what kind of changes have taken place in the campus environment.</p>

    <p>Such a wealthy change makes parents feel relieved!</p>

    <p>The school has money. This pleasing learning environment will naturally make people feel comfortable. And on the other hand, the teaching staff will definitely be improved to a higher level than before!</p>

    <p>At the school gate, a black business car drove by. Jiang Xiaoche was sitting in the driver's seat. He was about to unbuckle his seat belt and get out of the car to open the door for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But the girl refused on the spot: "Brother Xiaoche, no need. I can do it myself. You don't have to get out of the car to help me in the future!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche frowned: "But this is against the rules..."</p>

    <p>"Rules are set by people! Now I think it doesn't hurt to be more low-key." Sun Rong smiled. She opened the door and got out of the car, and followed the people around her into the campus.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jiang Xiaoche grit his teeth.</p>

    <p>His hands were tightly grasping the steering wheel. He watched the girl enter the school surrounded by a group of people and then drove away in the car.</p>

    <p>When they reached the corner, Jiang Xiaoche took out his mobile phone and began to lay out the battle plan: "Are you all ready?"</p>

    <p>A deep male voice quickly came over the phone: "Everything is ready. Just on the way home from school today. Everything will be carried out according to Brother Jiang's instructions!"</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Jiang Xiaoche nodded.</p>
