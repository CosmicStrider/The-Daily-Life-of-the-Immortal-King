  <h1>Chapter 2049 Wang Ling's Myopia Experience</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying was never merciful in his attacks. Xiufengnian was beaten until his nose was bruised and his face was swollen. He had no chance to fight back. A series of combination punches with serious injury effects. His Ancestor King-level self-healing ability was useless at this moment. He was completely beaten. I lost my temper.</p>

    <p>These are just physical internal and external injuries.</p>

    <p>The backlash of the soul caused by the miraculous contract being forcibly burned was the main reason why Xianfengnian truly felt the pain.</p>

    <p>The entire supreme world collapsed directly. Wang Ling returned to the immortal palace in the ancestral land of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>In front of the familiar ancient cauldron, Xufengnian lay there, covered in blood. The bandages on his body were torn to pieces. All the bones in his body were broken. It seemed that he only had his last breath left.</p>

    <p>This ending made Xifengnian somewhat unacceptable, but he had to accept it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's action made him fully understand the cruelty of the truth.</p>

    <p>From the beginning of this battle, he had no chance of winning.</p>

    <p>This seventeen-year-old boy was just playing with him.</p>

    <p>Not serious at all. Show your true strength.</p>

    <p>In other words, there was no intention to kill him from the beginning. Instead, he deliberately suppressed his blood pressure and beat him to such a dying state in order to get some information from his mouth.</p>

    <p>Gritting teeth in good years.</p>

    <p>The moment the miracle contract was burned, he knew his end.</p>

    <p>There is absolutely no point in resisting.</p>

    <p>This is an existence that can interfere with even the will of the universe...</p>

    <p>Although Xifengnian doesn't know exactly who Wang Ling is.</p>

    <p>And why does he have such amazing strength... It can even be said that it far exceeds Dao Ancestor Wang's amazing strength!</p>

    <p>Even Dao Ancestor Wang back then did not have the ability to directly interfere with the will of the universe!</p>

    <p>"burst!"</p>

    <p>Being a stubborn person, Xufengnian knew that he was invincible, so he immediately thought of blowing himself up. Even if the explosion didn't kill Wang Ling, it could still destroy the ancestral land of the Sun family and drag others into the water.</p>

    <p>He pondered in his heart. When the word "explosion" echoed in his mind, Xiufengnian could feel the remaining Ancestor King realm spiritual power in his body boiling instantly. In this short moment, his body became a high-concentration explosive container.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling has already seen this kind of operation.</p>

    <p>He slowly walked to the side of Xie Fengnian's body that was rapidly expanding like a balloon. He only put his palm against his body and typed a static character directly.</p>

    <p>Great Stillness.</p>

    <p>The user of the technique will be emptied of all the restless spiritual energy in the body and fall directly into an empty mental state. It is described in the language of modern cultivation. Wang Ling often also refers to the "Great Stillness Technique" as the "Great Salted Fish Technique" .</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this technique will make people completely give up the idea of resistance. They just want to lie down quietly and be an idle salted fish.</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling didn't even think about how to use this move in conjunction with combat. Later, I discovered that the "Great Stillness" has a miraculous effect on people who want to drag people to hell through body explosions.</p>

    <p>It seems to be specially designed to prevent such situations.</p>

    <p>Of course, if normal people use the Heavenly Dao spell, it may not be effective against the dead and rich years. After all, this is the Ancestor King realm.</p>

    <p>He has a certain immunity to many Heavenly Dao spells. Moreover, Xuefengnian himself is an ancient wizard. He also has many Heavenly Dao spells he has mastered.</p>

    <p>But in the face of absolute strength. Wang Ling uses Heavenly Dao to suppress it. It is still very convenient.</p>

    <p>When Xiufengnian was forced to calm down, this feeling of emptiness made him almost desperate. This was the real feeling of not being able to survive or die.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say any nonsense. He threw Xufengnian back into the ancient cauldron for suppression. Then he moved the entire ancient cauldron away. Only the King's Eyes was used to leave an identical " The real illusion "ancient tripod" can be touched. And it is no different from the original ancient tripod. No abnormalities can be found.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling is not interested in the ancient tripod itself. It is just a temporary loan.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren doesn't intend to interrogate you?" In the core world, Immortal Toya finally came to his senses and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"He was hit by the Master's Great Stillness Technique. We have to wait until he is completely awake before we can interrogate him. Now his thoughts are messy. He just wants to be a salted fish." Wang Ying replied.</p>

    <p>"That's it..." Immortal Toya felt sad when he learned the situation. He turned to look at Sun Ru. However, he saw that Sun Ru's face was still frozen in a state of surprise and had not recovered. The whole person seemed to be stuck.</p>

    <p>Sigh. This is the aftereffect of watching a battle at close range that transcends the worldview...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya remembered the first time he saw Wang Ling show off his skills. His expression was so unseen.</p>

    <p>Even though I was surprised when I just fought Immortal Toya, I already had some experience watching it, so I was able to recover quickly.</p>

    <p>But for Sun Ru, who was observing a super-dimensional battle for the first time, it would probably take some time to fully digest what he just saw.</p>

    <p>Solve the matter on Wanchenfengnian. Wang Ling also felt "injured" for the first time.</p>

    <p>Because the miraculous contract was forcibly burned. It cut off the connection between Xuefengnian and the tree on the other side. Helped the tree on the other side to escape from the suffering of such a betrayer of the cultivation world with an external tradition. Wang Ling also paid for this. Understand the cost of myopia within a 24-hour time limit.</p>

    <p>As for the tree on the other side that was released to freedom.</p>

    <p>Although the body has been polluted due to years of decay and abundance.</p>

    <p>But as long as the will of the universe is still there, after the tree on the other side is successfully released, the external system of the Heavenly Dao that has been forcibly planted on the body can be erased through the self-purification ability of the will of the universe itself.</p>

    <p>Although the Outer Gods were a powerful race that transcended eternity back then, it was still unrealistic for the orthodoxy of just one Outer God to interfere with the will of the universe.</p>

    <p>"I'm really short-sighted..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sat down and tried to use healing spells to repair his damaged vision.</p>

    <p>However, the results were minimal.</p>

    <p>The sequelae of confronting the will of the universe cannot be smoothed away with a simple Heavenly Dao spell. Fortunately, Wang Ling can feel that his eyesight is actually recovering on its own little by little.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling have never seen students wearing glasses in school. Although modern cultivation technology has been very developed, there are mature methods to treat myopia.</p>

    <p>But if the vision is damaged due to practicing specific exercises, then relying on modern cultivation technology will not help.</p>

    <p>To be honest, it feels quite uncomfortable to be near-sighted.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling finally knows how some people feel when faced with their own "big shielding technique."</p>

    <p>Everything you look at is a hazy mosaic. It's really easy to make people irritated.</p>

    <p>But this is a novel experience for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Six hundred degrees of myopia. In fact, it's not too deep.</p>

    <p>Although it is blurry, the rough outline of things in the field of vision can still be seen clearly. It will not directly become blind.</p>

    <p>And the key thing is that it also has a skin-dermabrasion effect when looking at people...</p>
