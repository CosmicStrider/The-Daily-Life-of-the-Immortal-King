  <h1>Chapter 2002 3-in-1. The Renaissance of the Universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy Depths.</p>

    <p>A dragon star shining with holy brilliance. Surrounded by countless black holes.</p>

    <p>That was Bai Zhe's deliberate method. Now he seems to have the ability to control black holes. As one of the three leaders of the dragon clan in the Eternal Era, Yueguang Dragon uses black holes to guard. This method is really enough to defy the heavens. It gives people a feeling that is so strong that it is unreal.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Bai Zhe has not yet reached the heyday of becoming a dragonborn. After several confrontations with Wang Ling, he believes that he has sufficient experience.</p>

    <p>"My past self was too anxious. After gaining great power, I was eager to challenge Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Now he fully understands that what he needs most right now is to continuously consolidate his own foundation.</p>

    <p>Even though Bai Zhe now feels that he is so strong that he is invulnerable, he is still reluctant.</p>

    <p>He sat cross-legged on the dragon star he created, using the black hole to protect himself.</p>

    <p>Continuously strengthen himself by absorbing the cosmic energy in the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>And those who followed him to practice together, except for Jingze and Yan around him.</p>

    <p>There is also the bunch of dark grapes transformed by Fenmu Shen that appears in the Dragon Star void.</p>

    <p>The Dragon Clan, in the past... the two most powerful and eternal forces that were originally hostile, chose to join forces at this moment.</p>

    <p>It would not be an exaggeration to call this a cosmic renaissance.</p>

    <p>"The Saints have agreed to our invitation." Sotos, the incarnation of Fenmu Shen, made a voice in the void.</p>

    <p>He is located above the Dragon Star, but he is like a giant watchtower. He can easily see the entire universe without moving his body.</p>

    <p>This is the omniscient and omnipotent cosmic observation power that comes with the Fenmu Shen version of Sotos...</p>

    <p>But even so, Fenmu Shen has the same idea as Bai Zhe. He believes that now is not the best time to attack the earth.</p>

    <p>Because of his omniscient and omnipotent observation of the universe. The only place that cannot be observed is the earth.</p>

    <p>The boy from Earth who pretended to be a pig but could actually eat a tiger was like a signal jammer, directly blocking his sight.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Fenmu Shen believes that the combat power of their entire team has not reached the point where they can reverse the universe.</p>

    <p>If we wait until that day, the shielding effect of this young man from Earth will fail, allowing him to observe the Earth.</p>

    <p>And that day was the day when they launched a war against the earth and the cultivators all over the earth.</p>

    <p>"Unsurprisingly. They have no choice but to join us."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe closed his eyes. He maintained a cross-sitting posture, with his back straight and his hands hanging naturally on his knees, floating in the void. His whole body exuded a translucent light that was almost like jade.</p>

    <p>The Yueguang Dragon horn above his head exudes healing and eternal moonlight. The slender white dragon tail hangs naturally along his tailbone. There are endless tiny star stones surrounding him. They are constantly integrating and then shattering.</p>

    <p>"You withdrew all the dragonborn from the earth." Fenmu Shen muttered.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Bai Zhe nodded: "We can't afford to lose anything now. Integrating combat power is the key."</p>

    <p>"But that little omnipotent dragon is still on Earth."</p>

    <p>"He is very strong, but he also has a variety of dragon genes that cause his development to be delayed. His slow cultivation speed is the biggest drawback. I tested him last time. If it weren't for the sister of the boy surnamed Wang, he wouldn't be able to withstand us." Bai Zhe looked calm. He didn't notice Wang Muyu at all.</p>

    <p>Although at the beginning, his purpose was indeed to train Wang Muyu. But looking at it now, this little guy's thoughts are not on the same front as them.</p>

    <p>Forcible twisting will definitely not work.</p>

    <p>But after all, Wang Muyu has the same dragon bloodline as them.</p>

    <p>Although this little guy is well-behaved and sensible now, who knows if he will turn into a rebellious kid in a while.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Bai Zhe was completely unhurried.</p>

    <p>Both are dragonborn. He has his own judgment.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there is still some time before the final battle to make arrangements. Before the war comes, he still has many opportunities to lay the groundwork.</p>

    <p>But as Fenmu Shen said, all the dragonborn on the earth were removed by him.</p>

    <p>The current earth is completely in a blind spot. Even Bai Zhe has sent some alien races to the earth through the Heavenly Dao star to visit the earth as alien envoys.</p>

    <p>However, recently the International Federation of Cultivators' review threshold for aliens entering the earth has become higher.</p>

    <p>And the Earth's alien diplomatic ambassador Guo Ping is the one who is prepared for danger in times of peace and has proposed to prevent alien spies from penetrating into the earth's cultivators.</p>

    <p>Due to the discovery of the Heavenly Dao planet, Guo Ping's say in extraterrestrial affairs far exceeds that of other cultivators on the earth. A very weighty word suddenly blocked the way for Bai Zhe to send alien beings to infiltrate the earth.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, Bai Zhe still has his own plans for this.</p>

    <p>That's hate...</p>

    <p>Perhaps it would be much easier to create divisions and dissatisfaction among cultivators on Earth than to find a third party to infiltrate.</p>

    <p>Because he has had the experience of being a human being, Bai Zhe, who is now a dragonborn, naturally clearly understands that human emotions are actually extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>Especially those various negative emotions. They can all be used.</p>

    <p>Because of jealousy, because of hatred, because of hatred... and Bai Zhe can use his own methods. He can easily take advantage of these negative emotions.</p>

    <p>"So. You gave one of your dragon scales to the man named Dai Tianchun." Fenmu Shen couldn't help laughing. The chaotic voice was creepy.</p>

    <p>"He doesn't know the origin of dragon scales. But with his ability, he can analyze such a substance. The rest is left to chance." Bai Zhe responded calmly.</p>

    <p>"Will anyone really eat this..." At this time, Yan? Finally couldn't hold back the words. She had lost a battle before and was directly captured by an enlightened toilet spirit. But she didn't know why the toilet spirit was actually there. After healing her injuries, let her go.</p>

    <p>This is annoying. There is always an indescribable feeling in her heart.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is the order given by Wang Ling. There is no other special reason. It's just that Wang Ling believes Yan? Is too weak. And it's useless to capture such a small dragonborn. The food consumption is also very expensive. It is better to put it back and fatten it up. Wait until it becomes stronger...</p>

    <p>However, what no one knows is that this release left a tiny seed in the heart of Yan?</p>

    <p>Although Bai Zhe has been instilling in Yan?, instilling the cruelty and ugliness of human beings, but after listening to these words, now and then, there will be moments of emptiness in Yan?'s mind.</p>

    <p>For example, right now. Just after she asked the question.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe immediately replied: "Girl, I told you that human beings are creatures with complex emotions..."</p>

    <p>It started again.</p>

    <p>Repeating clich√©s from the past like chanting sutras.</p>

    <p>Yan? can almost memorize all of Bai Zhe's lines in her mind.</p>

    <p>Human cultivators are creatures with complex emotions. They also have a strong desire to compare.</p>

    <p>Because they are unwilling to lag behind, they will continue to develop cultivation technology. They will continue to cultivate and strengthen themselves.</p>

    <p>Because of the greed after becoming stronger... there was a steady stream of aggressive wars in the past history of human cultivators.</p>

    <p>They compare. Involve. And then the cycle repeats...</p>

    <p>Although it seems that a long-term peace has been maintained now, once someone really wants to break the rules, war can immediately start.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe said: "So girl, no matter who Dai Tianchun gave this dragon scale to, he will definitely eat it..."</p>

    <p>"But can ordinary cultivators on earth withstand the pain of the dragon scale energy explosion?" Jingze also became curious: "Especially the master's dragon scale."</p>

    <p>"That depends on how much hatred he has."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe sneered: "As long as he can survive it, no matter how poor and weak he was in the past, he will be a high-ranking Tianlong in the future..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same moment, the battle between the monks in the spiritual space continues.</p>

    <p>He clasped his hands together. The whole person was suspended high. The golden Buddha light projected over Number 60 High School hit his bald head. It was like the reincarnation of the Buddha. Even if he did not deliberately use spiritual pressure, it still contained a strong oppression.</p>

    <p>"Monk who is pretending to be a ghost... do you think you are the sage of Buddhism!" Dai Tianchun was instantly angry. He had also killed some monks before. On the battlefield, some monks used it in the name of increasing their combat power, but in fact they did heinous things.</p>

    <p>In order to calculate the best opportunity to attack, their troops once believed the slander of a wild monk. As a result, the cultivation troops suffered unprecedented heavy losses.</p>

    <p>Although he won in the end, his brothers could not come back...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Dai Tianchun always had a bad impression of monks.</p>

    <p>The appearance of Jin Deng reminded Dai Tianchun of many memories of those hypocritical monks.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Dai Tianchun is like a white-haired lion king who has been bathing in the pale thunder. The blood all over his body is gushing. His muscles are swelling. His body size is doubling at a speed visible to the naked eye. Countless blood-sea killing auras are emanating from his body.</p>

    <p>The thoughts in the monk's heart also moved slightly with this murderous aura. Such an astonishing murderous aura is indeed rare.</p>

    <p>However, as the sage of Buddhism, Monk Jin Deng has always believed that as long as people still have good thoughts, they can return to the right path.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun is called the God of Killing by the world. He is regarded as the most unreasonable and reckless general. He is burdened with countless killings and blood debts. However, even for such a person.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the monk can still see the glimmer of humanity.</p>

    <p>Even though Dai Tianchun now hates the wild monk who deceived him back then, deep down in his heart he still misses those brothers who died fighting with him, right...</p>

    <p>Based on this alone, the monk cannot be found and killed... Oh no, the monk should say: physical transcendence.</p>

    <p>Yes. Based on this alone, he could no longer find a reason to surpass Dai Tianchun in physics.</p>

    <p>Of course, the monk also knew that Dai Tianchun's soul had been burdened with the years of killing and blood debt.</p>

    <p>If there is a way, it is blocked. It is better to be sparse.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the monk planned a square formation from the beginning of the challenge.</p>

    <p>He immediately dragged Dai Tianchun into his own mental space.</p>

    <p>Indeed, as Dai Tianchun said, there are not many people in this world who can withstand his huge killings and blood debt. But he would never have thought that the monk standing in front of him was one of them.</p>

    <p>The monk's purpose was to let Dai Tianchun release the heavy things he was carrying in his spiritual space.</p>

    <p>As long as these mental pressures are completely released, maybe Dai Tianchun can become a normal person without the need to undergo rehabilitation.</p>

    <p>Of course. These are just the monk's inner thoughts.</p>

    <p>The specifics still depend on practical operation.</p>

    <p>"die!"</p>

    <p>Rumble!</p>

    <p>In the sky of the spiritual space, Dai Tianchun, whose body expanded to the height of a small building, was like a thunder warrior. A huge energy group aimed at the monk and bombarded him.</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together and lowered his eyes slightly. He did not move his body. He just floated in the air. This energy group did not even touch his body, but was completely blocked by the Buddha's light.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the damage caused to the spiritual space by the energy group was also repaired by the Buddhist fire from the past summoned by the monk.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun's eyes were filled with tears. He was completely addicted.</p>

    <p>The space shook. He turned his arm into a red flame thunder blade and slashed at Monk Jin Deng!</p>

    <p>Mixed with thunder and fire, the sword light condensed his infinite killing power. A strong smell of blood hit his face like a rolling tsunami.</p>

    <p>No normal person can withstand this kind of impact. Even if they are in the True Immortal realm, this kind of mental pressure is too great. It is easy for people to have the same feeling that Dai Tianchun had when he was in the vast battlefield of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Lonely, hesitant, and at a loss. Apart from killing enemies and blood, roars and explosions of spells, it seems that nothing can be heard...</p>

    <p>"Hypocritical monk! I want you to die!"</p>

    <p>Sometimes adults collapse in just a moment. As a monk who has been reincarnated for thousands of lives, he can more or less understand such pain.</p>

    <p>"Buddha said, I will not go to hell. Who will go to hell?"</p>

    <p>So, Monk Jin Deng clasped his hands together without taking any defensive posture and allowed Dai Tianchun's sword to hit his head.</p>

    <p>However, this knife still struck a lonely chord.</p>

    <p>The gap in realm is irreparable. As the most delicate among the ancients, the monk's strength is deeply appreciated by anyone who has fought against him.</p>

    <p>In this world, except for Wang Ling, who can easily deal with this monk, in the eyes of other eternal beings, the existence of monk Jin Deng is a different kind.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was facing the mental pressure that Dai Tianchun had accumulated for thousands of years, and he was still able to deal with it calmly. The word "pervert" was no longer enough to describe the monk's power.</p>

    <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun was full of dissatisfaction. While he roared angrily, a set of armor appeared on his body.</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space, it was originally impossible to summon magic weapons.</p>

    <p>But there is only one exception.</p>

    <p>That's the chaos machine.</p>

    <p>This made the monk a little surprised. Because Dai Tianchun, as a local earth cultivator, could actually have a chaos device on his body. This was something the monk had never thought of before.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Dai Tianchun hid very well. In any previous battle, he had never used a Chaos Device.</p>

    <p>In other words, this battle in the spiritual space forced Dai Tianchun to take out the things he had packed at the bottom of the box.</p>

    <p>The monk could tell that this was no ordinary chaos device. The quality was not low, and it worked well with Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the average True Immortal level cannot control the Chaos Device. Therefore, in terms of controlling the Chaos Device, Dai Tianchun may have also combined some cultivation technology to share the pressure of using the Chaos Device.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of the Chaos Device, Dai Tianchun's realm at this moment is still at the peak of the ninth level of True Immortal, but his actual combat power has far exceeded this.</p>

    <p>The monk thought. Fortunately, he would be the vice principal of Number 60 High School. When he proposed this idea earlier, Lord Diulei also had his eye on this position.</p>

    <p>Later, out of respect for the senior's ideas, he gave it to the monk...</p>

    <p>If it were Lord Diulei who appeared here today. With Dai Tianchun's strength, Lord Diulei might not be able to resist.</p>

    <p>He is indeed the legendary Dai Crazy Demon.</p>

    <p>But today, this monk is here. No matter what kind of madman he is, this butcher knife must be put down.</p>

    <p>"Six Yuan Spirit Armor!"</p>

    <p>As Dai Tianchun roared, the chaos device summoned from the spiritual space began to fit his expanding body and began to multiply in size, like pieces of scales fitted tightly on his body.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of chaos machine produced from special materials from six kinds of universes. It has the powerful ability to adapt to the environment. It can adjust the user's behavior to the best fighting state according to the environment.</p>

    <p>It is also a chaos weapon of super-god quality...</p>

    <p>Among the five sequence levels of Chaos Device, its strength ranks second.</p>

    <p>Although the monk has encountered chaos devices that have reached the fourth level of light or even the fifth level of creation. However, the monk still feels a little incredible about the control of chaos devices in the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the science of cultivation is too powerful. He once believed that realm is the standard to measure everything. He did not expect that cultivation science and technology can really break this shackles.</p>

    <p>If given time, Mr. Wang Ming, who is urgently developing a new type of Talisman, may really be able to create a cultivator mecha that is comparable in strength to the True Immortal realm, or even more transcendent than the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>After merging with the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor, Dai Tianchun's offensive was obviously more fierce than before. He was like a siege weapon. His whole body turned into a cannonball and took off on the spot. He launched a bombardment at the monk.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A huge explosion sounded from the spiritual space. The entire space was shaken. There were constant sounds of explosions and fragments, which were quickly repaired by the monk's past Buddha fire.</p>

    <p>However, even under such a fierce attack, the monk still stood steadily in the air with his hands clasped together, looking invincible.</p>

    <p>Totally unbeatable...</p>

    <p>At this point, Dai Tianchun began to fall into doubt.</p>

    <p>He didn't take the vice-principal of Number 60 High School seriously at first. But he didn't expect that the other person turned out to be the monk he hated the most.</p>

    <p>Not only that. He is also an invincible monk whose combat power seems to be far beyond his. Even when he shows his trump cards, he cannot defeat him.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Dai Tianchun's heart began to waver. However, his body movements did not stop. He was still launching a new round of attacks.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk is here. No matter how Mr. Dai attacks, the poor monk will not fight back until Mr. Dai is satisfied." The monk spoke with a nonchalant attitude that made Dai Tianchun feel helpless and annoyed.</p>

    <p>He could actually vaguely feel that the monk in front of him seemed to be completely different from the wild fake monks who had been deceived and kidnapped on the battlefield to make war money. But such words were tantamount to provocation, which still made Dai Tianchun furious.</p>

    <p>He has absolutely no fear.</p>

    <p>When neither the long-range spell bombardment nor the successive rounds of melee attacks could harm the monk at all, Dai Tianchun thought of a crazy decision like he was possessed.</p>

    <p>The next second, the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor all over his body began to emit bright light. At the same time, a huge amount of energy began to gather towards his core.</p>

    <p>The monk seemed to have anticipated what the other party was going to do. However, he still maintained the stable posture of the most sacred person in Buddhism.</p>

    <p>"Bald Donkey! Can you still pretend to be calm now?"</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun roared angrily. Then the next second he jumped into the air. Carrying this huge energy that was about to explode, he hugged the monk tightly into his arms.</p>

    <p>This is to directly use all of one's own power to detonate this spiritual space.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun saw that the monk's weird Buddha fire had the ability to repair the cracks in the spiritual space. But if it directly exploded the entire space, the mysterious Buddha fire would be useless.</p>

    <p>Cracks can be repaired quickly, but once the spiritual space collapses, they will disappear completely.</p>

    <p>He is going to die together with Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Even at the cost of permanently turning their bodies into vegetative states in the real world.</p>

    <p>The monk actually has a clear mind. This is Dai Tianchun's last attack. After this outbreak, all the pressure on him will be released.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise that shook the sky. Dai Tianchun and the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor on his body all exploded. Huge energy swept across the entire spiritual space. Countless everything was shattering and being crushed into fine powder.</p>

    <p>And Dai Tianchun could clearly feel that his soul had separated from his body.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly... after enduring a long period of mental torture, he would eventually die in peacetime because of a fight with the principal out of spite.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter...</p>

    <p>At the very least. He also took away a nasty monk.</p>

    <p>On the way to hell together, it doesn't seem too bad to have someone to keep you company...</p>

    <p>If this person is not a monk, that would be better.</p>

    <p>He was thinking deeply in his mind.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Dai Tianchun suddenly felt as if he had really let go of everything.</p>

    <p>He didn't even know why he started to feel a special emotion in his heart.</p>

    <p>Regret...</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun could not imagine that he, who had always been decisive in killing and never hesitated, would feel regretful.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the thoughts of the battlefield killing god were messy. He thought of all the past. Then he began to regret his stupid operation of holding the monk and detonating his soul.</p>

    <p>Things of the past are in the past.</p>

    <p>The painful things he was carrying have also been let go.</p>

    <p>Those former comrades died as he charged. And since he was lucky enough to survive... it is only right that he should continue to live in this beautiful world with their beliefs.</p>

    <p>So. Does he still have a chance to choose again...</p>

    <p>Who else can give him the chance to make a new choice?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Dai Tianchun's soul drifted in the infinite galaxy and universe. Suddenly, he seemed to see the vague outline of a young man...</p>

    <p>The young man walked toward him with his hands inside his pockets. He stretched out his index finger and tapped his forehead lightly.</p>

    <p>Then Dai Tianchun felt as if his soul had found a place to stay and quickly retreated.</p>

    <p>Countless stars around him began to flow backwards.</p>

    <p>When he opened his eyes again, he still saw the calm face of the monk.</p>

    <p>And he actually looked like a girl, being carried by the monk in his powerful arms like a princess...</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun was shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what was going on.</p>

    <p>But it can be confirmed that the monk's spiritual space was not exploded as he thought.</p>

    <p>And he and the monk are still alive...</p>
