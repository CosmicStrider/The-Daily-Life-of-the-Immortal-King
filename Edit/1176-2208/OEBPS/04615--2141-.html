  <h1>Chapter 2141 The game of koi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The latest website: Itinerant Immortal is a technological city in the Ring World. It is full of a sense of the future. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi also felt a familiar feeling when they appeared here as game characters.</p>

    <p>The base of this science and technology city was obviously transformed from the original Mechanical City in the Void Ring. That battle allowed Wang Ming to successfully obtain the blessing of the Divine Brain.</p>

    <p>They were standing in an unfamiliar neighborhood. The surroundings exuded the faint smell of motor oil. The eye-catching neon lights were illuminated staggeredly at night. The degree of restoration was amazing.</p>

    <p>Although the base is in Mechanical City, Bai Qiao has obviously broadened and improved on that basis. Just with this kind of environment rendering, players do not operate anything when entering the game. They can just treat it as traveling.</p>

    <p>But now both Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi know that this is not the time to play.</p>

    <p>Compared with the well-defined slums and the urban center of the gentry in the Mechanical City, the Technological City in the Itinerant Immortal Ring is obviously more rule of law. There are wandering mechanical eyes everywhere. This will stop some players who interfere with the game world and punish them in time.</p>

    <p>Mechanical City has the highest concentration of players. It is also the map where it is easiest to bump into other players in the Novice Village. In order to prevent players from fighting each other for treasures, the mechanical eye mechanism was created.</p>

    <p>If you do something illegal and disorderly within the scope of the Science and Technology City, a star rating will be given next to the character's avatar based on the illegality index.</p>

    <p>The lowest wanted level is one star. The highest level is five star wanted level.</p>

    <p>Among them, the treatment of five-star wanted is unimaginably sour. According to the game mechanism of Itinerant Immortal, once a player reaches five-star wanted, the entire search scope will directly extend to places outside the Science and Technology City.</p>

    <p>The Science and Technology City will send a large number of police with mechanical eyes to areas outside the Science and Technology City to search for five-star wanted players. Moreover, it will be a comprehensive search by sea, land and air.</p>

    <p>Not only the mechanical eye police in Science and Technology City, but also all the ally cities that are allied with Science and Technology City will send a certain amount of manpower to participate in this encirclement and suppression operation.</p>

    <p>In other words, a player with a five-star wanted status is truly wanted by the Itinerant Immortal World. Except for hiding in a wild map full of dangers, there is almost no possibility of survival.</p>

    <p>Once caught, they will be executed directly on the spot. They will lose all their equipment and return to the respawn point.</p>

    <p>The entire capture time will last for seven days. Under such a high-intensity and intensive search, any player will be daunted.</p>

    <p>But the same thing. If a player can successfully survive these seven days, he will get unimaginable rich rewards from the game world! As well as three special effects: permanent binding, no loss after death, and never wear out. A piece of random orange equipment!</p>

    <p>"So. Has anyone succeeded?"</p>

    <p>Looking at the mechanical eyes on the street, Xiang Yi felt that this was an almost impossible task.</p>

    <p>He and Qin Zhong were standing here for a while. They had already seen dozens of mechanical eyes passing by. It was too dense...</p>

    <p>Once you become a five-star wanted person, it's not even a matter of whether you can survive seven days. Whether you can escape from the Science and Technology City is a question.</p>

    <p>After all, if you really want to survive these seven days, you must first find a way to escape and look for possibilities to survive outside. If you are inside the Science and Technology City, with the density of these mechanical eyes, they will not catch you in minutes.</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, no one has succeeded so far. But after all, the rewards are huge. There are always people who seek death." Qin Zhong patted Xiang Yi on the shoulder and motioned for Xiang Yi to follow him.</p>

    <p>He didn't do the novice mission directly because he felt that the rewards for the novice mission were completely unnecessary. It was a waste of time.</p>

    <p>Koi play games. Of course there are Koi ways of playing.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

    <p>"I am the auxiliary. You are the output. Since you are the output, the first priority is to get you a weapon." At this time, Qin Zhong walked to a weapons store. Through the bulletproof glass window, he looked at the dazzling array of items inside. Gunsling said.</p>

    <p>Yes. He wants to get Xiang Yi a sniper rifle in the game world.</p>

    <p>"How is it? Are you interested?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>"These guns. They don't look very smart."</p>

    <p>"Then let's take another look. Shop around. Don't be in a hurry."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi scratched his head. He smiled awkwardly and said: "But I still don't understand. Even if I can like it, you can't afford it. I just saw it. Just a weapons store like that. The lowest sniper rifle costs 100,000. Two pieces of silver. This doesn't count ammunition."</p>

    <p>"As long as I want to buy it, there is always a way." Qin Zhong said. He still had that harmless smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi has seen this kind of confidence too many times.</p>

    <p>Although he has seen how lucky Qin Zhong is.</p>

    <p>But this is the game world. Even if his koi attributes can be brought into the game world, this is a novice village! How can a novice carry around more than one hundred thousand taels of silver when he is born!</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong is used to having doubts about himself. But the reason why he can be so calm is of course because he has his own way.</p>

    <p>This is Qin Zhong's experience as a koi fisherman for many years.</p>

    <p>While passing by a weapons store, Qin Zhong discovered that this weapons store actually had an activity to test the precision of firearms. This was originally a way for the boss to attract business and gather guests. But Qin Zhong discovered a business opportunity on this basis.</p>

    <p>He quickly pulled Xiang Yi over.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi didn't understand what Qin Zhong was going to do, so he heard Qin Zhong step forward and volunteered to say to the boss: "Boss, is your gun accurate?"</p>

    <p>"The accuracy has been adjusted. What do you think?" The boss showed contempt in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. I'll be your target. If you miss, give me a gun."</p>

    <p>"You want to be a living target?" The boss laughed: "Okay! Just the firearms on the counter. If you can dodge it, I will give you one for free!"</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly. The boss actually agreed directly.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi was astonished by the high degree of freedom in the game world of Itinerant Immortal. Such a conversation is theoretically impossible. But it happened to be Qin Zhong's request. As an NPC boss, he actually agreed to it.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is the boss's own judgment.</p>

    <p>After all, Qin Zhong's level is not high. His purpose is just to attract business, so it does not conflict with the purpose in essence. And if Qin Zhong is really shot, Qin Zhong will definitely die. He will be resurrected directly at the rebirth point.</p>

    <p>He has nothing to lose.</p>

    <p>A player who is only level 1. Even if his firearm is just scratched, it will be fatal.</p>

    <p>But Qin Zhong was not afraid at all.</p>

    <p>He walked directly into the shooting range of this weapons store and stood at the ten-meter target.</p>

    <p>The owner of the weapon shop smiled even more wildly: "Everyone! Since this little brother has volunteered to be a target. www.uukanshu.net I naturally have no reason to refuse his request! Everyone, take a look. How accurate are the weapons below!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he took out a sniper rifle in front of him and pointed it at Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>It's only ten meters away! There's no need for a magnifying glass at all. It's really difficult to miss the target at this position!</p>

    <p>However, the corners of Xiang Yi's mouth were already twitching.</p>

    <p>Because based on past urine patterns, he seemed to have guessed something.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A crisp gunshot sounded. A 12.7mm caliber sniper rifle bullet was shot from the muzzle with blue flames.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong folded his arms and stood firmly on the spot.</p>

    <p>And in the end, the sniper bullet accurately landed below Qin Zhong's earlobe, leaving a hole-piercing crater on the wall of the weapons store...</p>
