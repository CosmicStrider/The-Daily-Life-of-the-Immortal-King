  <h1>Chapter 2003 The Gentle God of Killing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: No one could imagine that a man who made almost all the principals fearful and who was known as the God of Death would actually lie on the monk's arms in such a posture.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun was so ashamed that he immediately covered his face with his hands. He just wanted to find a hole to crawl into...</p>

    <p>This scene is so beautiful. It is no different from the time when Jingke suddenly triggered the passive ability of "Hairy Legs and Shoulders" at the Spirit Sword Exchange Meeting. Anyone who sees it will be embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"This is a spiritual space. Mr. Dai doesn't have to worry about being seen by outsiders. Only you and I know about this." At this time, Jin Deng said calmly.</p>

    <p>This sentence reminded Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>That's right...this is a spiritual space. This scene is invisible to outsiders.</p>

    <p>But he still had an unspeakable shyness. He jumped down from the monk's arms with almost gritted teeth. He stared at the monk with a red face. If it weren't for the ferocious look of the silver-haired lion king on his face, it would be like a girl's manga. The heroine: "This battle does not count! We will fight again another day!"</p>

    <p>"Why doesn't it count?"</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "In my opinion, Mr. Dai has achieved a complete victory."</p>

    <p>"Are you laughing at me, monk!" The corners of Dai Tianchun's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"No. Mr. Dai."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng shook his head and said eloquently: "Now you have overcome the inner demons that have troubled you for thousands of years. Isn't it? This is Mr. Dai's victory. It has nothing to do with the poor monk. And this battle. The poor monk did not take action. If Mr. Dai had been more serious, it would have been a tie at best."</p>

    <p>The logic of these words was impeccable. Hearing this, Dai Tianchun was immediately speechless. His heart was as clear as a mirror. Naturally, he also knew that the monk was deliberately trying to find a way out for himself.</p>

    <p>So he just curled his lips, waved his sleeves and snorted: "That's it! Let's just treat it as a tie! But next time, we must compete!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Dai, I see you clearly." The monk performed the Buddhist ritual and said respectfully.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to exit the mental space, Dai Tianchun frowned tightly at this moment. After thinking for a while, he gritted his teeth and spoke to Jin Deng: "But monk... that scene just now, you are not allowed to give it to me. Say it!"</p>

    <p>"Exchange of equal value. Please keep Mr. Dai's identity as a monk confidential." Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that with Dai Tianchun's personality, he would probably not trust others so easily if there were no corresponding conditions in exchange.</p>

    <p>So this deal, in the monk's opinion, is actually very fair and a good deal.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Dai Tianchun accepted happily. At this point, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"So, before Mr. Dai leaves, can you tell me one more thing?"</p>

    <p>"Let's talk." Dai Tianchun put his hands behind his back. His patience was much better than before.</p>

    <p>Although there was still a hint of impatience in his tone, the monk knew clearly that Dai Tianchun was no longer the frightening god of death he once was.</p>

    <p>"Where did the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor that Mr. Dai just sacrificed come from?" the monk asked.</p>

    <p>A person who is at the peak of the ninth level of the True Immortal Realm. He can handle a second-level chaos device. He can also directly control it. This is a particularly incredible thing in the eyes of the monk.</p>

    <p>You need to proceed with caution. Investigate clearly.</p>

    <p>Of course, Dai Tianchun, who was in the God of Killing state just now, was still unable to fully utilize the value of the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor because of the shackles he received from the realm. Maybe he used the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor, which is already amazing.</p>

    <p>"You mean that top-notch anti-realm magic weapon?" Dai Tianchun asked?</p>

    <p>"Hmm..." The monk was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Dai Tianchun's understanding was still wrong. He thought it was just a particularly powerful anti-world magic weapon. He didn't realize that what he got was actually a chaos weapon.</p>

    <p>"That thing was accidentally obtained by me from a meteorite that fell from an alien planet. It was an object caught in the meteorite. I was also very surprised at the beginning as to why there is such a top-notch anti-realm magic weapon in this meteorite."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun said: "I couldn't control it at first. But in order to be able to use this magic weapon smoothly, I specially built a wireless voltage dividing device. This allows me to not bear too much pressure when driving this magic weapon."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Dai Tianchun sighed: "What a pity. In the battle with you just now, this top item that I finally got was directly destroyed. Speaking of this battle, I still lost. point."</p>

    <p>"Since there is such an opportunity, I believe that I will meet Mr. Dai again in the future." The monk said with a gentle smile.</p>

    <p>"A smooth-tongued guy."</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun sneered: "Sure enough, I still hate monks the most..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he waved his sleeves and walked out of the spiritual space door opened for him by monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the real world on the other side, the figures of Dai Tianchun and the monk never moved from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>This battle seemed to last for a long time, but in fact it only lasted a moment. Judging from the news heard from Wang Ling, the two of them started fighting at the same time less than three minutes after entering the mental space. Blinded.</p>

    <p>Then, Principal Dai flicked his sleeves and left the school in front of all the teachers at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>No one knows what kind of chaos happened in the spiritual space.</p>

    <p>And in the end, this principal battle initiated by Principal Sheng Ke ended with a "tie" declared to the outside world.</p>

    <p>The new Vice Principal Huo has completely become the biggest idol among the teachers and students of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Even if it's just a tie. But this tie is personally admitted by the principal of Shengke. Even if it is a game between experts, in the eyes of the whole Number 60 High School, it is actually Number 60 High School. great victory!</p>

    <p>The one you sent from Shengke High School is a serious principal! Number 60 High School tied with you with only the vice principal. Of course Number 60 High School won!</p>

    <p>And this battle also completely dispelled everyone's doubts about the new Vice Principal Huo. Almost all the classes in Number 60 High School celebrated this event immediately.</p>

    <p>No one knew what the two principals were doing in the spiritual space. So various speculations followed.</p>

    <p>In a chat group with four people: Wang Ling, Chen Chao, Sun Rong, and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao also shared the information immediately: "I heard from an uncle of mine. A battle in the spiritual space. Our Vice Principal Huo was discussing math problems with Principal Dai from Shengke! But in the end neither of them could solve it. That's why it's a tie."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Discussing...mathematics?"</p>

    <p>"Guo. You are talking nonsense. Vice Principal Huo is a math teacher. And Principal Dai from Shengke is also a well-known person in the magic weapon science community. How could he not be able to solve math problems?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao directly sent a voice message to complain: "I see. It must be a big showdown in the dark! Don't look at that Principal Dai flinging his sleeves and leaving the gate of our Number 60 High School. I think he is shy because he can't beat him. Oh...hey. I had a dream yesterday. I dreamed that Vice Principal Huo hugged Princess Dai. I was so scared that I woke up on the spot."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>
