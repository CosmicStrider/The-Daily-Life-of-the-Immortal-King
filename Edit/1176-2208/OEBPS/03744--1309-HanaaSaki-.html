  <h1>Chapter 1309 Humble Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling woke up. The soul returned to the body.</p>

    <p>The conversation with the Bronze Cat in the Forsaken Land seemed like a long time, but in fact it only lasted a moment.</p>

    <p>In front of us, the surviving Heavenly Dao and the humanoid Er Ha are still producing death talismans on the assembly line. This was originally the second insurance imposed by Wang Ling after Sun Rong obtained the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>As for the promise of the Bronze Cat in the Land Abandoned by God, it is the third way.</p>

    <p>He didn't believe that with the persistence of this triple insurance, who else could abduct the girl's soul...</p>

    <p>"What did you see?" Er Ha seemed stunned for a moment when he saw Wang Ling. He asked hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, Wang Ling's attention is relatively concentrated, because he has to study hard. Operations like deserting in class will not happen to Wang Ling who loves learning.</p>

    <p>So if you are stunned, then there is only one situation, and that is when the soul leaves the body.</p>

    <p>I have lived with Wang Ling for a long time. Er Ha thinks that this level of understanding is completely basic.</p>

    <p>"The creatures in the gray fog." Wang Ling said six words.</p>

    <p>What?</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't understand its meaning.</p>

    <p>However, after Heavenly Dao, who was writing the scapegoat, heard these words, the movements of his hand suddenly stopped.</p>

    <p>There was disbelief in his eyes: "How did Zhenren know..."</p>

    <p>"What are the creatures in this gray mist?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"This is taboo. It cannot be said..." Heavenly Dao's body was trembling.</p>

    <p>"Taboo?" Er Ha smiled: "How many slaps can this taboo be worth to my Little Master Ling?"</p>

    <p>Survival Heavenly Dao was stunned when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He really didn't know how to answer this question...</p>

    <p>Although Heavenly Dao has never seen the powerful existence of this gray mist creature.</p>

    <p>However, he also roughly knew from word of mouth from the Golden Men in Heaven that the strength of this gray mist creature was at least as strong as that of the monk.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Heavenly Dao was lost in thought. He didn't know where Wang Ling knew about the existence of this gray mist creature.</p>

    <p>But survival Heavenly Dao changed his mind.</p>

    <p>He thought it might be okay for him to say it.</p>

    <p>This gray mist creature is indeed terrifying. It is regarded as a taboo by heaven.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. He is now in Ling Zhenren's home! Is there any safer place in the world than Ling Zhenren's home?</p>

    <p>And since Ling Zhenren has told about the gray mist creatures, it proves that Ling Zhenren is probably already prepared.</p>

    <p>So when I thought about it, Heavenly Dao felt that even if he said it, it wouldn't matter.</p>

    <p>"This is a taboo existence... it once made a big fuss in heaven a long time ago..." said the survivor Heavenly Dao with a look of fear in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Making trouble in heaven? Is this person related to Dao Ancestor Wang?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>I have to say. This question hits the nail on the head.</p>

    <p>Naturally, those who can make a big fuss in heaven these days are not good-natured ones. To give an inappropriate example, this is just like those people who refuse to pay back money... essentially they are all uncles.</p>

    <p>"I have never seen this gray mist creature. It is said that it is a mythical beast kept in captivity by Dao Ancestor Wang. No one has seen what he looks like. I only know that he has a pair of indestructible claws." Survival Heavenly Dao said .</p>

    <p>"Which one are you more afraid of, being held on your neck by Lord Jingke or being held by the claws of this gray mist creature?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>This soul question made Living Heavenly Dao suddenly twitch the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>This is a great problem...</p>

    <p>It's just like the question of who to save first if your girlfriend and your mother fall into the water at the same time. Whichever side you choose, you will die!</p>

    <p>They Heavenly Dao. are so humble!</p>

    <p>There was a trace of despair in Heavenly Dao's eyes: "This question. Please forgive Zhenren... I really don't know how to answer... However, this gray mist creature is indeed terrifying. Maybe this will be what Zhenren will encounter." The most powerful opponent."</p>

    <p>As I said this to survive Heavenly Dao, I was imagining a possibility with a particularly low probability.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there are devils on both sides now...</p>

    <p>Why not let the devils fight with each other? If they die together, won't they be able to make heaven pure in the end?</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling read out the little thoughts of surviving Heavenly Dao. He was silent in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when, but his impression in Heavenly Dao also became a "devil?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is puzzled.</p>

    <p>Isn't it the last time I put Jingke on the neck of Heavenly Dao and questioned him for a while?</p>

    <p>Does this make him a devil?</p>

    <p>And he was just a little anxious at the time and had no real intention of killing Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling is reflecting.</p>

    <p>He is such an amiable person.</p>

    <p>Follow the rules of Heavenly Dao honestly and conscientiously.</p>

    <p>What are the requirements really? He also paid the price in exchange of equal value!</p>

    <p>Don't mistake the village chief for a cadre! Expired crispy noodles are also delicacies, right?</p>

    <p>He would be reluctant to give it to ordinary people!</p>

    <p>As a result, this group of Heavenly Dao actually looked at him like this. He was so ignorant of current affairs... He deserved not to appear in the first season of the animation! Humph!</p>

    <p>"What are Ling Zhenren thinking?" He was stunned (si) again when he saw Wang Ling. Survivor Heavenly Dao asked weakly.</p>

    <p>He was actually a little afraid that he had really offended Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is a generous person. He doesn't care about so many things.</p>

    <p>And in order to get rid of the "devil" impression in Heavenly Dao's eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided to go with the flow and do a good thing for the little Golden Men of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>"Has no one seen the appearance of the gray mist creature?" At this time, Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>He looked at Heavenly Dao, trying hard to maintain a amiable image on his face.</p>

    <p>This stiff smile made Heavenly Dao tremble all over: "Zhenren. You'd better stop laughing... it's so scary..." You smiled as if you were crying...</p>

    <p>Those words are outside the quotation marks. In the end, Heavenly Dao did not have the courage to say it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't care. He continued to send messages and asked: "So, do you think about it?"</p>

    <p>These words immediately stunned Heavenly Dao: "What are you looking at? That creature in the gray mist?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>Survivor Heavenly Dao looked extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>Since ancient times, the creature in the gray fog has always maintained an extreme sense of mystery. No one has seen his true appearance. This is by no means just talk.</p>

    <p>And at the same time.</p>

    <p>The pressure brought by the mystery hidden deep in the gray fog also makes all those who know the existence of the gray fog creatures remain silent and change their expressions.</p>

    <p>The fear of the unknown is always there.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling is doing now is to help Heavenly Dao get rid of the fear of the gray fog creatures first.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren... this..."</p>

    <p>"My little master is asking you if you want to see it. Don't talk so much nonsense." Er Ha rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>Survival Heavenly Dao gritted his teeth. At this moment, he seemed to have made a great determination: "I want to see it!"</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He opened his King's Eyes to explore the world.</p>

    <p>When the power of King's Eyes penetrated into every corner of the universe, the creatures hidden in the gray mist were finally captured by Wang Ling's sight.</p>

    <p>Under the pupil power of King's Eyes, all the gray mist lingering around the gray mist creatures suddenly disappeared...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling projects the body of the gray mist creature into the void in his bedroom.</p>

    <p>Through layers of fog.</p>

    <p>Survival Heavenly Dao finally saw clearly what this gray mist creature looked like.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Heavenly Dao was shocked.</p>

    <p>He never expected it.</p>

    <p>It was originally supposed to be a gray mist creature with a high-end atmosphere and a classy image.</p>

    <p>His body is actually a...</p>

    <p>Groundhog...</p>
