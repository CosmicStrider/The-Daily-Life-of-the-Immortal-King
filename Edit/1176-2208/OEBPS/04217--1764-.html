  <h1>Chapter 1764 So ordinary yet so confident</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On Saturday, January 3rd, the morning news reported something about the underground black intelligence industry chain. The news did not mention the Tengu. It was purely made for these people to see.</p>

    <p>It's a warning.</p>

    <p>However, given the urinary temperament of the Tengu gang, Wang Ling feels that these guys will not shed tears until they see the coffin. It is difficult for them to be frightened by a piece of news.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Zhuo Yi. has made great contributions in the command operations in the past few days. He has long asked Lord Diulei to issue a secret order from the sect master to let the Office of Strategic Deception unify its rhetoric. Once again, all the credit will be given to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>For example, in this operation, one was wearing a raccoon mask and the other was wearing a nine-tailed fox mask... These two young people from the Office of Strategic Deception were regarded by Martial Saint Jiang as having great potential. They were both with Zhuo Yi, the mission was successfully completed under excellent command.</p>

    <p>Using Zhuo Yi. Wang Ling, came out clean again.</p>

    <p>It's just that on Martial Saint's side. When Wang Muyu suddenly thought of forcing him away, it was only a temporary solution. Wang Ling heard that Martial Saint Jiang was still trying to find out more information about him. We need to find another way to do this after all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that these old men among the ten generals are not easy to deal with...</p>

    <p>In addition, Wang Ling also feels that the matter of Tengu cannot be delayed any longer.</p>

    <p>The other party went after Sun Rong before, but ended up mistakenly capturing Jiang Yingying. The reason behind this was already guessed by Wang Ling when he learned that Jiang Yingying was mistakenly captured.</p>

    <p>Tengu probably has information about Wang Muyu in hand. That's why they needs to capture Sun Rong to prove it. In other words, those people have information about Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>If Wang Muyu's information is made public, then it will be troublesome.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this underground intelligence organization. Wang Ling feels that it cannot stay any longer.</p>

    <p>It must be uprooted in the shortest possible time.</p>

    <p>This time, it was rare. He took the initiative to send a text message to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The text message contains only three words:</p>

    <p>Destroy the Tengu...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was well aware of the importance of this matter. He immediately replied: "Brother, please rest assured. I have made comprehensive arrangements. I believe there will be results soon! Please rest assured, brother, and take care of the baby. Waiting for good news."</p>

    <p>Saw the reply. Wang Ling almost spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>Then again, he really wanted to meet Wang Muyu today.</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling was actually very repulsive about getting along with this little kid. Mainly because he felt that it was impossible to have anything in common with such a child.</p>

    <p>But when he knew that Wang Muyu had also become obsessed with the taste of crispy noodles, he suddenly became convinced.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling even feels that Wang Muyu is indeed a talent that can be cultivated in a sense.</p>

    <p>With a little training, it might still have a bright future.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Destroy the Tengu.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei received the instructions from Wang Ling, he was in awe.</p>

    <p>In my impression, Wang Ling rarely took the initiative to arrange any big tasks for him. Even if he did send text messages or make phone calls, they were all trivial and innocuous things.</p>

    <p>As for the Tengu, the coalition formed by the Huaxiu Alliance and branches from various countries has been watching for a long time like jackals and tigers. It is just because the Tengu personnel are numerous and scattered that they have never been able to form an effective attack.</p>

    <p>It is easy to catch one or two Tengu. But it is difficult to catch them all.</p>

    <p>"I know. This is difficult. But even if it is difficult, we must do it."</p>

    <p>In the main hall of True Venerated Immortal, Lord Diulei began to prepare plans to wipe out the Tengu. All core members of the Office of Strategic Deception attended the meeting in person or through remote projection.</p>

    <p>The Intelligence Team of the Office of Strategic Deception is currently run normally by the Lord and Lady of Immortal Castle under the supervision of many senior elders. Before Immortal Castle was incorporated by the Office of Strategic Deception, Immortal was involved in intelligence warfare. The Roaring Sky Alliance that Bao once formed with Tengu is also a close opponent.</p>

    <p>Therefore, regarding the Tengu, the castle master and the castle lady have certain information.</p>

    <p>At the meeting, the castle master stepped forward, bowed to the elders from all directions, and said, "Elders, I have dealt with the Tengu before. In fact, in this operation in which Miss Jiang Yingying was mistakenly captured, I also acted on the orders of the True Lord. Secretly sent people to search for information. I wonder if the elders have heard of a person named Skunk in Duobao City? "I know. Isn't this a very famous intelligence dealer?" Lord Diulei said: "This person has more than just one name. The underground intelligence trading market in Duobao City. Even in other intelligence trading markets, it is slightly famous."</p>

    <p>"This person is actually an old member of my original team at Immortal Castle."</p>

    <p>At this time, the castle owner bowed and said: "However, the skunk actually encountered an accident when we were incorporated into the Immortal Castle. Now that I think about it carefully, it should be the work of the Tengu group."</p>

    <p>"The skunk is dead? Who is the one wearing the skunk mask who appeared in Duobao City?" At this time, many elders in the field showed surprised eyes.</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>The castle owner gave up and smiled slightly: "Please ask the senior who plays the skunk to come forward and explain yourself."</p>

    <p>Just the next second.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, who had been listening with his arms folded, suddenly took a step forward.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Qin, it's you?" Cailian Zhenren raised her eyebrows. Hua Rong was also extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>And when Qin Zhong stepped forward, everyone in the venue understood it instantly.</p>

    <p>As we all know, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are the two new guests of the Office of Strategic Deception. However, they suddenly disappeared recently. It seems that they have accepted the new task and are secretly planning this matter.</p>

    <p>"So. Zhenjun has already started planning?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"It can't be said that it was planned for this matter." Lord Diulei smiled bitterly and shook his head: "Originally, I asked Brother Qin to disguise himself as the Skunk. It was to perform other tasks. But I didn't expect that instead, it led to something like this."</p>

    <p>"So. Mr. Qin plays the role of a skunk. But where is Mr. Xiang?"</p>

    <p>"He's also Skunk too."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled and said: "I asked Brother Qin and Brother Xiang to wear skunk masks. They haunt the major intelligence trading dark markets across the country. The purpose is to test the movements of the Tengu. If the Tengu knows about the Skunk, The Skunk is not dead. New Tengu scavengers will definitely be sent to attack the people wearing skunk masks."</p>

    <p>"Nice."</p>

    <p>The castle master nodded and continued: "It turned out that before the real skunk died, he was very powerful. Therefore, the Tengu scavenger who killed him back then was a fourth-grade one. And the Tengu side now knows that the skunk is not dead. Then send someone to hunt down the skunk. The scavenger must be at least level five."</p>

    <p>"This time, thanks to Mr. Qin and Mr. Xiang, we were able to lure the snake out of the cave in a short period of time and capture two fifth-grade or above Tengu alive. Although they are not specialized in intelligence work, they are just scavengers in the Tengu queue. But they know few things."</p>

    <p>"And through the current analysis of their memories, there are two latest pieces of information that can be learned."</p>

    <p>"Glio City in Mixiu Country."</p>

    <p>"Glio City?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned: "I remember. This is one of the most prosperous cities in Mixiu Country."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded and said: "There are many fragmented memories about Glio City in the two people's memories. Although it has not been completely analyzed, it is not difficult to judge. Glio City should be related to the Tengu lair."</p>

    <p>"So. Where's the second key piece of information?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"The second one..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei paused. Then he replied: "As for this second piece of information, it is...Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"Six...Number 60 High School?"Zhuo Yi and everyone present were all stunned.</p>

    <p>"Although Miss Jiang was captured by mistake, the Tengu seemed to be very dissatisfied with our Office of Strategic Deception secretly sending people to rescue Miss Jiang. And now, Miss Jiang Yingying is studying at Number 60 High School. So Number 60 High School. It may be the next target of the Tengu Scavengers." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone couldn't help but twitch their lips.</p>

    <p>The current Number 60 High School is completely different from the Number 60 High School during the previous Shadow Stream attack.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling is not here.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing, Zhenyuan immortal, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Gu Shunzhi... just these hidden masters who hold the position of elders in the Office of Strategic Deception. They are all students inside now.</p>

    <p>In addition, Sun Rong who now has nine-core Aohai and the Death Heavenly Dao who was the security captain at the door...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought about it all night and still couldn't figure out why these tengu scavengers dared to do this.</p>

    <p>Some villains.</p>

    <p>Obviously so ordinary, but so confident...</p>
