  <h1>Chapter 1195 Wang Ying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Now Wang Ling finally discovered a misunderstanding that he had fallen into all along.</p>

    <p>Although through Wang Ming's dream. Wang Ling, he has discovered that the man behind the scenes may have some connection with himself. However, he has always been thinking about himself in the parallel space. But he has ignored the clues that are right in front of him.</p>

    <p>That is. His shadow.</p>

    <p>To be precise, this is a part of the shadow separated from his shadow.</p>

    <p>The other party is very smart. In order to prevent himself from seeing any flaws, he deliberately retained a small part of the power of the shadow to confuse him, so that he did not pay attention to the shadow that had been following him under his feet.</p>

    <p>During the period of separation, the other party also continued to improve his cultivation, and relied on a method similar to "the big fish swallows the small fish" to strengthen himself by constantly devouring the shadows of others.</p>

    <p>That kind of strange resurrection technique is probably just to prepare for "swallowing."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that even though I was so cautious, I would still be fooled by my own shadow.</p>

    <p>Since it is my own shadow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately decided to give White Hair a name: Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>This name sounds like a good one.</p>

    <p>"Hmph! Don't give me a random name!" On the other side, White Hair heard Wang Ling's voice and immediately let out an angry snort. He knew that they were at the same level. Between himself and Wang Ling No one should be able to do anything to anyone. In other words, if Wang Ling hadn't deliberately exposed his spiritual flaw, he wouldn't be able to hear Wang Ling's inner voice at all.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ying immediately understood. Wang Ling was intentional. He deliberately let himself hear this name!</p>

    <p>What a despicable guy!</p>

    <p>Do you think that with such a name, you can make him surrender?</p>

    <p>From the moment he separated from Wang Ling, Wang Ying had already made a vow. He would never become anyone's accessory in this life!</p>

    <p>He is. Unique!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that one day he would have a battle with his own shadow. This feeling is very strange, similar to the "fighting between left and right" in martial arts novels. It is not an exaggeration to call it an advanced version.</p>

    <p>Use sealing techniques?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling was staring at Wang Ying. He was thinking of possible ways to deal with Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>If you are facing off against Wang Ying, the opponent will probably do the same thing again.</p>

    <p>Fighting in front of the sun. If this damages the spirit of the sun, it will only be a fatal blow to the earth's environment.</p>

    <p>So what Wang Ling is thinking is to use high-level sealing techniques to seal Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>This was the gentlest method he could think of.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if you use the sealing technique, you won't be able to use the ordinary Heavenly Dao spell.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying knows all his abilities. No matter what tricks he uses, the opponent will copy them perfectly.</p>

    <p>So. This showdown is a brainstorm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling must use the abilities he possesses during the duel. Rearrange and combine them. Develop new abilities to deal with Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>It's like the permutation and combination in mathematics. Four identical numbers will become brand new numbers as long as they are rearranged and reorganized!</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling has to do is use the constantly developed new spells to win!</p>

    <p>These spells were compiled by Wang Ling. Even if Wang Ying knew what kind of abilities they were rearranged and combined to develop, it would be impossible to copy them instantly! There is also a calculation process involved!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling plans to take advantage of the time difference to defeat Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"What? Do you want to defeat me by designing a spell on the spot?" However, to Wang Ling's surprise, the plan he thought was feasible was instantly pierced by Wang Ying on the other side.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is very clear. This is definitely not the ability of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Unless they deliberately reveal flaws in each other, no one can read the other's mind.</p>

    <p>"You underestimate me. Wang Ling. I am separated from you... Even if I can't read your mind with his mind, I can predict it based on my understanding of you. I don't know what you are thinking about." Wang Ying stood in front. The expression on his face was a little bitter, and even more self-deprecating: "Have you forgotten? Countless nights, you are learning. I am also growing with you. You I know all of his habits like the back of my hand."</p>

    <p>These words made Wang Ling's pupils shrink slightly.</p>

    <p>It also made Wang Ling feel that he did underestimate Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>After all, it is something separated from oneself. It not only possesses spiritual intelligence, but also possesses all of its own abilities... It is indeed very different from those opponents in the past who knew a few three-legged cat kung fu.</p>

    <p>This may be the first person Wang Ling has encountered. A character that cannot be defeated directly with just a slap...</p>

    <p>But at the next moment.</p>

    <p>Looking at the young man in front of him, Wang Ling let out a sigh.</p>

    <p>And with this sigh, Wang Ying suddenly felt that the nearby space began to vibrate within a thousand feet.</p>

    <p>"Sealing formation? How to do it?" The formation was arranged quietly. This suddenly caught Wang Ying off guard. He was trying to predict Wang Ling's formation. However, he couldn't see it. What kind of ability was used.</p>

    <p>Except for the first sigh, Wang Ling did not move at all. He just stood here. He had not formed any seals. There was not even any spiritual energy fluctuations flowing out of his body.</p>

    <p>But this formation was arranged just like this!</p>

    <p>That's a brand new formation!</p>

    <p>At least in the memory of Wang Ying when he was still a shadow, he had never seen such a magic circle.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The surface of the blazing sun was divided into a square chessboard. Countless stars gathered and moved around on the chessboard like chess pieces. The center of the chessboard clearly divided two spaces, one yin and one yang.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling was standing at the intersection of Yin and Yang. He didn't even raise his eyelids. The chess pieces made of stars above the chessboard suddenly made a roaring sound. One after another, they exploded. Move in the direction of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>This is a new move developed by Wang Ling that combines a variety of spells. When the chess pieces collide together, the hit target is immediately sealed!</p>

    <p>The intensity of this move is comparable to level 14.</p>

    <p>The power is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>However, at the moment when the chess piece was about to hit Wang Ying, the chess piece that was originally moving at high speed stopped for an instant.</p>

    <p>Just under Wang Ying's feet, a chessboard measuring thousands of feet was also formed!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that there was a force against him, which forced his pieces to stop moving.</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao chessboard + star shifting formation + all things dust..." Although it took some time to calculate, Wang Ying finally calculated the "recipe" for this new sealing spell.</p>

    <p>And such a fast verification is also a bit unexpected for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It seems that simple permutations and combinations cannot fool Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>He must devise some more complex spells.</p>
