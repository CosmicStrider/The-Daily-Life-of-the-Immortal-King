  <h1>Chapter 1287 The eagle catches the chick</h1>

  <div>

    <p>I can only say that Miss Ajuan is indeed a Miss Ajuan.</p>

    <p>As a still-developing king of the divine realm, he was able to tell the truth at a glance. This made the monk deeply admired.</p>

    <p>This eagle is indeed an eagle, but not the newer and longer one.</p>

    <p>As for the Seven Dao Supremes headed by Zhou Zhentian, they are indeed as weak as chickens in the eyes of the monks.</p>

    <p>The most terrifying thing for a cultivator is that he doesn't know himself.</p>

    <p>The monk has already made this mistake once. Naturally, he will not make it a second time.</p>

    <p>He is a sensible person.</p>

    <p>Know how to reflect.</p>

    <p>I examine myself three times a day.</p>

    <p>I'm talking about the monk.</p>

    <p>But not everyone is self-aware and capable of introspection.</p>

    <p>"Monk! Take my shot!"</p>

    <p>There is a vertical row on the opposite side. The seven Dao Supremes instill all spiritual energy into Zhou Zhentian.</p>

    <p>They are condensing mana!</p>

    <p>I saw six people putting their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. They leaned forward slightly and aimed at the monk.</p>

    <p>The monk understood instantly.</p>

    <p>These seven people used the form of "driving a train" to turn into a very long cannon barrel!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the leader of the Zhou family, Zhou Zhentian, opened his mouth wide. Countless psychically dense cannonballs exploded from his mouth!</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>This novel trick surprised the monk.</p>

    <p>What surprised him wasn't because of how powerful this move was.</p>

    <p>But I feel that the Dao Supremes in this God's Domain don't seem to be people with normal brain circuits... why can they come up with such weird tricks!</p>

    <p>But let me tell you. The lethality is still very strong!</p>

    <p>The seven Dao Supremes gather spiritual energy into one point. Not only do they share the pressure of spiritual energy consumption, but they also make the power more concentrated!</p>

    <p>The leader, Elder Zhou Zhentian, transformed into the mouth of the abyss in League of Legends. While leading the people behind him to move, he kept "spitting" at the monk.</p>

    <p>The psychic cannon was first released from the mouth of Elder Zhou Zhentian. Then it instantly grew in size and grew to the size of a cannonball!</p>

    <p>The cannonball passed by and the space was split. Countless cracks appeared.</p>

    <p>The bombardment hit the four walls of the meeting hall, creating huge craters.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "..."</p>

    <p>The power is there. But the picture is so beautiful that the monk is afraid to look at it.</p>

    <p>The Ajuan girl next to her was completely dumbfounded with laughter. She was rolling on the floor with her belly in her hands and laughing like a barbell.</p>

    <p>Monk didn't expect that Dao Supreme in God's Domain had degraded to this point.</p>

    <p>Try to think of some tricks that are neither interesting nor useful...</p>

    <p>"Fancy."</p>

    <p>The monk easily dodged the bombardment while moving forward.</p>

    <p>The body-protecting Buddha's light on his body lingered around and lit up, making the crimson red moon cassock shine brightly.</p>

    <p>From the moment the Buddha's light shines on, dodging is no longer important.</p>

    <p>The monk received the cannon head-on. Those psychic cannons bombarded him. They were immediately washed away by the body-protecting Buddha's light and synchronized with the Buddha's light. They disappeared like a mud cow entering the sea.</p>

    <p>"Monk! Don't underestimate me!" Zhou Zhentian still refused to admit defeat!</p>

    <p>He increased the jet speed of the psychic cannon in his mouth!</p>

    <p>From five sprays per second at the beginning to sixty sprays per second now!</p>

    <p>Patriarch Zhou Zhentian feels like he has transformed into a human fort!</p>

    <p>"Lao Zhou! Can you withstand it?"</p>

    <p>The other family elders are worried about Elder Zhou's condition.</p>

    <p>The human psychic cannon move of the seven-member group was thought up by these seven elders together.</p>

    <p>Elder Zhou Zhentian's previous record was only forty sprays per second!</p>

    <p>They were worried that Elder Zhou Zhentian's throat would not be able to support it!</p>

    <p>This frequency is too fast. It's like putting a vibrator in your throat. You will definitely be hoarse and unable to speak the next day.</p>

    <p>"Don't give up! I can still do it! I must let this monk learn a lesson!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Elder Zhou's eyes were already red.</p>

    <p>He increased his frequency again!--seventy sprays per second!</p>

    <p>Anger once again stimulated Elder Zhou's physical potential!</p>

    <p>This attack speed is really amazing. At the same time, at the extremely high rate of fire, the power of the psychic cannon has also been improved to a certain extent!</p>

    <p>However.</p>

    <p>Even so, it still can't break the body-protecting Buddha's light lingering outside the monk's body...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Death Heavenly Dao led Zhuo Yi, Sun Rong to the exit of Daoxuan Hall.</p>

    <p>Because there was a fierce battle inside, which resulted in the entire Daoxuan Hall being destroyed. There was no need to enter the hall to watch the battle...</p>

    <p>"Is this... the battle of cultivators in the divine realm?" Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>She looked at the seven Dao Supremes lined up in front of her, spitting madly, and couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Little did he know that Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao on the other side were also dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>This style of painting is wrong!</p>

    <p>The promised battle between cultivators in the divine realm. The destructive power is indeed fierce. But why does it look so ridiculous!</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior. Are they performing the Human Centipede?" The girl opened her mouth slightly in surprise. She could not hide the shock and fear in her expression.</p>

    <p>This is really scary. It's hard to describe it as blinding!</p>

    <p>"Senior Heavenly Dao. What on earth is going on?" Zhuo Yi also felt that something was wrong with the picture.</p>

    <p>It felt like they had walked into a 4K theater and were watching a gun version of a watermarked movie...</p>

    <p>"Well. Cultivators in the divine realm have unique combat thinking... this is something that cultivators on earth won't understand. It's normal that you don't understand."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao cleared his throat. He was trying his best to explain the battle situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>After all, the Divine Realm is also the birthplace of cultivation.</p>

    <p>As one of Heavenly Dao's little Golden Men, Death Heavenly Dao naturally shoulders the mission of maintaining the divine realm and spreading the culture of cultivation...</p>

    <p>"Senior Heavenly Dao. Why are they lined up in a row?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Look at the graceful figures of the seven Dao Supremes. They put their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. They are as flexible as snakes. This is combined with the movement technique of "Wandering Dragon out of the Sea." I am afraid it can be found in lion dance. Inspiration. Cultivation is such a simple knowledge. You have to find inspiration from the details of life. Only then will it be easier to break through..." Death Heavenly Dao replied.</p>

    <p>"That's it! The one who sprays the energy ball from his mouth is..."</p>

    <p>"This is the performance art of the Dao Supremes. They are using this form of magic to warn the world not to spit everywhere, thereby protecting the environment and warning the world!"</p>

    <p>"As expected of a senior... this can be accomplished..." Sun Rong couldn't help but mumble.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing..."</p>

    <p>In Buddha Golden Lotus. Sun Rong raised his hand again: "Then why was their team separated by senior Jin Deng?"</p>

    <p>While the girl was talking, in the almost destroyed Daoxuan Hall meeting hall, seven Dao Supremes were knocked off the ground by Jin Deng's Buddha Palm!</p>

    <p>These seven Dao Supremes instantly turned into ant-like black dots and were thrown into the sky.</p>

    <p>Then. Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang...</p>

    <p>One after another they fell to the ground...</p>

    <p>A Dao Supreme is a trap.</p>

    <p>Just seven people were killed.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao wiped his sweat: "This is Dao Supreme's tribute to the famous poet Bai Juyi. Youdao is like big beads and small beads falling on a jade plate... This is the ground of Daoxuan Hall. It's like a jade plate. This is also Dao Supreme Their performance art..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the girl was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then she asked the last question: "But... why did all the seven elders vomit blood?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao Fu forehead.</p>

    <p>He can't make it up anymore!</p>

    <p>è‰¸!(a kind of plant)</p>
