  <h1>Chapter 1812 Living in a dark secret room with Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A square secret room eight feet long and wide. Wang Ling and Sun Rong were locked up here. In the secret room with the same rules, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were in one group. Li Youyue and Fang Xing were in one group. They were also imprisoned.</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone faces the same problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that both his hands and Sun Rong's hands were put in special shackles. It would be difficult to break them apart directly if they were only in the normal Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p>He and Sun Rong have the same shackles. One end is connected to him. The other end is connected to Sun Rong's hand after bypassing the giant stone lock at the front of the secret room.</p>

    <p>The key to unlocking the shackles is behind the stone lock.</p>

    <p>That's a very extreme position.</p>

    <p>If one person approaches the key, the chain connected to the shackles will shrink towards the other person, and finally hit the soft needles densely packed on the back wall. These soft needles contain paralyzing venom. Once caught, it means at least the next two to three sessions, they will be missing a member of their combat capability.</p>

    <p>Maybe it will become a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is no way to ensure the survival of everyone. There is a small iron saw within reach of the two of them. However, it is impossible to cut the chain with just a small iron saw. Unless one person is sacrificed to directly cut off their own arm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that this was the plot of {Chainsaw}... Sure enough, it is a variety show that modern people think about. The routine behind it is always a tribute to the classics.</p>

    <p>He sighed silently in his heart and was seriously thinking about countermeasures. But the dilemma he was facing seemed to be more than that. Sun Rong's heartbeat was too fast, and it was especially obvious in such a quiet environment.</p>

    <p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang...</p>

    <p>Constantly irritating Wang Ling's eardrums.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He has strengthened Sun Rong a lot. And the girl has experienced a lot of big scenes in recent days. Logically speaking, it is impossible for her to be that scared.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that she is a girl and is afraid of the dark.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a long time. This is the only answer that came to mind.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how to comfort Sun Rong. In the end, he just said awkwardly: "Don't be afraid."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong's heart beat faster. Her face was so red that she buried it directly in her knees.</p>

    <p>Even though she was covered by a mask, she was still worried that her expression would be noticed by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After gaining strength, how could she be afraid of the layout of the secret room?</p>

    <p>It's not because of being locked up with this idiot...</p>

    <p>However, it is normal to not understand the style of the wood in front of you.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has long been used to it.</p>

    <p>So the current challenge for Sun Rong is no longer limited to this small secret room and variety show challenge tasks. It is easy for Sun Rong to break through the secret room. What is more important is to make this piece of wood understand her own thoughts!</p>

    <p>In such a dim environment, she can use her fear of the dark as an excuse to act a little more scared than before... maybe she can make this piece of wood come to his senses and protect her. In this way, she can get closer to a relationship with Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>So for now, for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She has only one mission. That is to never let Wang Ling know. In fact, she is not afraid of the dark at all...</p>

    <p>As for the other side.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, his challenges are no longer limited to this small secret room and variety show challenge tasks. Breaking the secret room is easy for Wang Ling. But more importantly, he must keep a low profile.</p>

    <p>Even in such a dim environment, there are so many camera balls surrounding them from all angles. Even if they are blocked by masks, the variety show will still be broadcast after the filming is completed. Now it is only the first part. If you are too outstanding at this time, you will definitely be remembered by the audience.</p>

    <p>Participating in variety shows originally went against the Old Wang family's low-key strategy. So Wang Ling now has only one idea. That is to be as low-key and useless as possible. Just leave everything to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But the problem is that he never thought that Sun Rong was actually afraid of the dark...</p>

    <p>There is no other way.</p>

    <p>Under this situation, Wang Ling doesn't want to do it himself. But now he and Sun Rong are grasshoppers in the same boat. Someone always has to show up.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling suddenly thought of a way. That is, he could use the fear of the dark as an excuse to hide in a corner, and then wait for Sun Rong to take action... According to scientific research, people in extreme environments, can stimulate adrenal hormones to make a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Being afraid of the dark is just a small problem. Wang Ling believes that with Sun Rong's personality, it will be overcome in a short time!</p>

    <p>So for now. For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He has only one mission. That is to never let Sun Rong know. In fact, he is not afraid of the dark at all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong buried her face in her knees for a long time. She thought Wang Ling would find a way to comfort herself. But she didn't expect that this young man who just told her "don't be afraid" would actually do the same. He buried his face in his knees.</p>

    <p>She was shocked.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling is also afraid of the dark?</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This is something Sun Rong never expected.</p>

    <p>Although... but...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling buries his face in his knees like this. It's really cute!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong used her peripheral vision to look at the young man who was maintaining the same posture as herself. Thoughts abounded in her mind.</p>

    <p>She suddenly felt.</p>

    <p>In such a dark environment.</p>

    <p>It seems good to just stay with Wang Ling like this...</p>

    <p>It is impossible to struggle.</p>

    <p>Now she and Wang Ling locked together with a chain.</p>

    <p>Her warmth and kindness may be directly transmitted to the young man's heart along this chain.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the temporary video studio set up outside the sports center, Mrs. Lawen and a group of photographers who used remote controls to control the camera ball stared at the scene in front of them in stunned silence.</p>

    <p>This variety show has just begun. The most interesting thing is that Miss Sun is in the secret room. The two of them actually buried their faces in their knees for the first time, without moving.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Ma, what happened? Why is the ball in the camera still motionless?" Mrs. Lawen asked a photographer named Ma.</p>

    <p>"Madam, this is not a still picture. It's that the two people really didn't move."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"Maybe...afraid of the dark?"</p>

    <p>The photographer smiled bitterly: "Theoretically speaking, this is also a sign of tacit understanding...but there is nothing we can do in this situation. We can only let them seek breakthroughs on their own."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Previously, Mrs. Lawen suspected that there were hidden masters among the people at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>She thought that through this link, she could find out who was the hidden master. And she focused her main energy on the group Sun Rong and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The woman's intuition told her that these two people were the most likely. But what Mrs. Lawen never expected was that both of them were afraid of the dark...</p>

    <p>This show has just begun. It's okay to bury your face in your knees like an ostrich...</p>

    <p>I invited you here to perform, not to show off your cuteness! How can you fix it!</p>

    <p>"You guys hurry up and think of a way. We can't let them stay like this. Give me a way to stimulate them." Mrs. Lawen said.</p>

    <p>She didn't believe it. After she increased her efforts, the two of them could still remain indifferent.</p>
