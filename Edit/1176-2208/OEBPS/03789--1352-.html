  <h1>Chapter 1352 Gu Shunzhi's Secret</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi came to ask for help. This is what Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>After all, if a person is not in a desperate situation, it is impossible to agree to the condition of being his own mother's fake boyfriend...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi are in love. Wang Ling has calculated the relationship between the two.</p>

    <p>This is a happy ending.</p>

    <p>In other words, there is actually no possibility of subsequent breakup.</p>

    <p>So under such a premise, why can Gu Shunzhi continue to exist? There is a big problem...</p>

    <p>He is a person who traveled from the future. His original purpose was to stop the relationship between Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi. But it backfired.</p>

    <p>"I actually didn't expect their progress to be so fast. After all, at this point in time, it's still some time before my dad comes back from his trip to the galaxy. My parents got started after my dad came back from his trip to the galaxy."</p>

    <p>In the bedroom of Wang Ling, Gu Shunzhi knelt down in front of Wang Ling and sighed: "Zhenren. Now I can only rely on you!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Also, I was slapped by my mother today. I suspect that someone cast a curse... If Zhenren is convenient, can you also help investigate?"</p>

    <p>"..." The expression on Wang Ling's face seemed a little hesitant.</p>

    <p>After all, he himself is the culprit of the whole drama.</p>

    <p>His initial purpose was just to test the {Single Spell} and give it a good job. Unexpectedly, he accidentally got into trouble.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the "memory loss" ban has not been activated.</p>

    <p>This is most likely because Gu Shunzhi and Liu Qingyi are not a real couple.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling left behind the original purpose of the "memory disappearance" mechanism. It was to prevent lovers from separating.</p>

    <p>Now Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen not only did not separate because of the {single curse}, but they are still together.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the mechanism of memory disappearance does not function properly.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling's expression, he hesitated. Gu Shunzhi thought that he had made too many requests, which made Wang Ling unhappy.</p>

    <p>So, he quickly changed his words: "My matter is more important... the matter of the person who cast the curse. If Ling Zhenren finds it troublesome, forget it. I can investigate it myself. I will definitely let this person come out to apologize in person!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling does not doubt Gu Shunzhi's investigative abilities as an "Order."</p>

    <p>But this matter... he must expose it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. He was prepared.</p>

    <p>While Gu Shunzhi was talking. In the toilet of Wang Ling's bedroom, a branch quietly stretched out...</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>A sap hit Gu Shunzhi on the back of his head.</p>

    <p>"Living up to Zhenren's trust. The physical amnesia technique was successful!"</p>

    <p>This is a talking branch. After confirming that Gu Shunzhi was knocked unconscious, laughter like a bell broke out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had long expected Gu Shunzhi to come. He permanently strengthened a branch of the Yushen Tree for the purpose of "physical amnesia."</p>

    <p>Why permanent reinforcement?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks that Miss Yu's place may be used in the future...</p>

    <p>{Physical amnesia} is very simple. Wang Ling can also do it by himself. However, Wang Ling is not sure if he does it by himself. Attacking the head is likely to blow away the person's head.</p>

    <p>And the reason why we focus on the Ushen Tree is because the Ushen Tree cooperates with Lord Ma. Now we can extend its branches to wherever we want.</p>

    <p>In this way, it will be much more convenient for Wang Ling to use {Physical Amnesia}.</p>

    <p>As long as he calls the Ushen Tree in his heart, a strengthened branch will instantly appear on the back of the head of the person who needs amnesia and hit it.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Miss Yu's strength control is extremely good.</p>

    <p>Not only will there be no sequelae after being pumped.</p>

    <p>The spiritual energy of the sacred tree on the branches can also penetrate into the cerebral cortex. Those who have been smoked will have a refreshing effect after waking up!</p>

    <p>About ten seconds later, Gu Shunzhi woke up. And his complexion was obviously much better than before he came to the Wang family villa.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi didn't know what happened just now.</p>

    <p>It was as if I was just in a daze.</p>

    <p>After returning to consciousness, he saw Wang Ling helping him sort out the timeline with a serious look on his face.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. What a great person!"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>According to the clues provided by Gu Shunzhi, his father Gu Cheng only met Liu Qingyi after returning from travel.</p>

    <p>Their relationship quickly grew and they gave birth to him soon after.</p>

    <p>When Gu Cheng came to the Liu family in the Divine Realm to propose marriage, that was also recorded in the history of the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>After the marriage between the two families, the Liu family's status among the ten major families in the God's Domain has skyrocketed. It quickly reached the third position, kicking the Zhou family, which was originally ranked third.</p>

    <p>In order to prove that what he said was true, Gu Shunzhi also produced a lot of photographic evidence.</p>

    <p>The charming-looking woman in the photo is undoubtedly Liu Qingyi herself.</p>

    <p>On that day, after the two got married, it was rumored that Wang Zhen was disheartened and never returned to the divine realm again...</p>

    <p>This plot sounds like the same thing at first. However, Wang Ling feels that there may be a hidden meaning in it.</p>

    <p>"My Lord! My Lord! I have something to say!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice of the Sage Immortal Book came.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling last time casually stuffed the Book of Sage Immortal into Lord Ma's mouth. It seems that he has fully reflected on it.</p>

    <p>However, a death sentence can be avoided and a life sentence cannot be spared. Wang Ling has never given up his plan to give away the book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p>"Is this Lord Holy Book..." Gu Shunzhi turned around and bowed.</p>

    <p>"Based on the timeline. I already have a reasonable answer." The book of Sage Immortal said.</p>

    <p>He planned to reveal all the results of his reasoning in exchange for a chance to atone for his sins.</p>

    <p>"Master Holy Book already has the answer?" Gu Shunzhi was startled.</p>

    <p>"nice."</p>

    <p>The book of Sage Immortal said: "Everyone thought that Wang Zhen left the divine realm in despair after losing Liu Qingyi and never came back. So is there another possibility. That is Wang Zhen Eloped with the real Miss Liu."</p>

    <p>"The real Miss Liu?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's mouth twitched in shock.</p>

    <p>It took me a long time. It turned out to be a "fake?"</p>

    <p>"Impossible! I definitely didn't identify my mother!" Gu Shunzhi retorted: "I used the orderer's tracking privileges to secretly mark my mother's soul with a soul mark. Then I tracked her here. I will never make a mistake."</p>

    <p>"You did not make a mistake. But you also have to remember. If the object you mark is an object generated by the body... then when you track, before the marked object has been generated, your mark will Falling back on the body."</p>

    <p>Although this sentence from the Book of Sage Immortal is very difficult to pronounce, Gu Shunzhi seems to have understood what is going on: "Master Holy Book means..."</p>

    <p>"What your father fell in love with from the beginning is Miss Liu's shadow. And your mother is also Miss Liu's shadow. It's just that at this time, Miss Liu's shadow has not yet awakened. So you are marking the future. It will eventually return to Miss Liu's body."</p>

    <p>"So this is what happened..." Gu Shunzhi fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>"The accuracy of this inference is as high as 78%"</p>

    <p>After finishing the book of Sage Immortal, he sighed: "If my father-in-law hadn't been a bachelor, which affected some of my emotional judgments, the accuracy would have been even higher."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>
