  <h1>Chapter 2167 High-end elixirs will not melt!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. !</p>

    <p>Utilizing natural conditions to refine pills will greatly increase the chances of creating top-grade special pills. However, under modern conditions, due to environmental protection and other factors, the volcanoes of major cultivation countries are under strict surveillance.</p>

    <p>Active volcanoes are state-owned properties of all major cultivating countries.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the operation of refining elixirs through active volcano craters is difficult to achieve in the context of modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>And because the danger of making alchemy through volcanoes is too great, using active volcanoes to make alchemy is also strictly prohibited in modern cultivation methods.</p>

    <p>Because the formation of a special elixir is likely to trigger a greater natural thunder disaster. When the thunder disaster pours into the crater, it will directly become the fuse to detonate the volcano, ultimately causing irreversible damage.</p>

    <p>However, this rule is not restricted in the game world.</p>

    <p>The most authentic restoration of the world of cultivation laws of the old era. This itself is also one of the charms of the Itinerant Immortal magic ring. But for Mr. Canghu, although he has the ability to lay out the market for high-end elixirs at this stage, he can use active volcanoes to refine elixirs. The risk is far greater than before.</p>

    <p>This also means that Mr. Canghu needs to recruit trustworthy players to help him. Otherwise, based on his current strength, even if he hires the top NPC to help him, there will still be too many surprises.</p>

    <p>So, who should I look for?</p>

    <p>Call people directly through [World Channel]?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Mr. Canghu fell into deep entanglement.</p>

    <p>Now that he has decided to find someone, the helper he finds must be strong enough.</p>

    <p>The president of the Four Elephants Group has gone crazy. He is killing newcomers everywhere in the wild map. If he does not have a master to protect him in his subsequent actions, he may also become the target of the opponent's sword.</p>

    <p>By the way...</p>

    <p>Isn't Fuyun Town recruiting Wolongs?</p>

    <p>At this time, Mr. Canghu raised his eyebrows. Today's Fuyun Town can be said to be a gathering of talents. It can be said to be the safest place in the world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the presence of that powerful general, even the Four Elephants Clan dared not easily provoke that area. They had just suffered a humiliating defeat and were probably still feeling frustrated, which is why they chose other wilderness maps to wreak havoc on other newbies.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the more the Four Elephants are stirring up trouble in the wild, this will actually make players move closer to Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>Because there are strong players here. Incidents of high-level players bullying new players will happen in this area.</p>

    <p>He will definitely be despised by the rest of the world.</p>

    <p>"Looks like it's time to go there in person."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Mr. Canghu was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>This Fuyun Town has been his focus from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Because he has seen too many times on the World Channel.</p>

    <p>And Mr. Canghu had doubts about the identity of the Fuyun Town general from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>Although most players now think it must be an NPC, it would be a bit outrageous if it were a real player.</p>

    <p>It can be analyzed from the perspective of behavioral logic.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu identified it from the beginning. It was 100% a real player...</p>

    <p>Definitely not an NPC.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the map of Future Science and Technology City, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi also successfully became members of the Four Elephants Guild after being recommended by Li Ziye, an Immortal player.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the Four Elephants are almost synonymous with evil people in the guild. Members of the Four Elephants guild are almost all unwelcome wherever they go.</p>

    <p>Especially after the incident in which Xiong Wu openly tried to bully newcomers by relying on his level advantage, the entire guild entered a "bringing evil people" mode.</p>

    <p>If someone takes the lead and the guild is not welcomed, then there will be two distinct forks at the next intersection.</p>

    <p>Either quit the guild. Or just follow the leader Xiong Wu and cause trouble. Join the team that bullies others.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye is considered a veteran player of the Four Elephants. He still has a lot of affection for the Four Elephants. He doesn't understand why the president of his guild suddenly went crazy and became like this.</p>

    <p>"Although I also rob... but I won't be so blatant!" Li Ziye yelled.</p>

    <p>Indeed...</p>

    <p>When Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi were robbed at the beginning, Li Ziye planned it carefully. He knew that this behavior was very bad, so he specially surrounded Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi into a building, and then decided to take action.</p>

    <p>But what he never expected was that he would be manipulated by Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to sympathize with other players." Xiang Yi smiled: "You were merciless when you robbed us before."</p>

    <p>"That was all an accident..."</p>

    <p>"Tell me about it. What other bad things have you done?"</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye sighed: "Have you... heard of the elixir assassin?"</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about the kind of elixir that is sold without a clear price tag?" Qin Zhong raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He had also been tricked when he visited the drug store before. He was full of naughty words and was about to make a complaint. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of the elixir assassin business was actually Li Ziye in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Wow. It turns out it's you who is doing these things."</p>

    <p>"Well, it's a willing buyer and a willing seller. I'm doing this to make money. Besides, the pill itself has value. It's just a tiny bit pricey."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye made a gesture of understanding as he spoke: "And compared to other elixirs, my elixir is indeed different."</p>

    <p>"What's the difference?"</p>

    <p>"Other elixirs need to be stored at a constant temperature. Once the temperature is too cold or too hot, either the medicine will lose its effectiveness or it will melt directly. This elixir of mine is different. This elixir of mine will not melt!"</p>

    <p>At this point, Li Ziye seemed to have some pride on his face: "My pills are the result of my own painstaking research and development. The pill skins are made from pure, natural, pollution-free calfskin jam from the Missouri State, which is extracted and boiled naturally before being purified."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a marketing story made up by Li Ziye in order to successfully sell his elixir.</p>

    <p>The world of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring is huge. Although Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are just players, they have done strategy work before coming here.</p>

    <p>Where is a place like Midong Dongli Prefecture?</p>

    <p>"I have no enmity with you. Why do you treat me like a fool?" Qin Zhong looked at Li Ziye with a smile.</p>

    <p>Li Ziye felt a little guilty when he saw Qin Zhong's eyes. He immediately sighed and said, "I'm targeting the high-end pill market, so naturally I have to fleece the high-level players... They're the ones with money, I never lie to newbies. Only the rich can buy these pills. But it's true that my pills don't melt in the story I just told."</p>

    <p>"So confident? What if... you throw your elixir into an active volcano?"</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye thought for a while.</p>

    <p>He really hasn't tried it...</p>
