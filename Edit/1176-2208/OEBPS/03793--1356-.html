  <h1>Chapter 1356 Zhao Qingxian's wishful thinking</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo YiI didn't expect Boss Sun to be so concerned about his master's affairs.</p>

    <p>But after talking, he felt that there was no need to be too wary of Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is a "reasoning genius", yes. But he is also a person who knows how to take care of other people's feelings.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because I knew his master's low-key personality that I made a special appointment with him to ask him about the situation.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, with Mr. Boss Sun's temper, I'm afraid he would have visited his "in-laws" with large and small bags.</p>

    <p>Strategy is a long-term solution. Emotional matters need to be cultivated slowly. Mr. Boss Sun understands these principles.</p>

    <p>The more he hopes that his precious granddaughter can truly be happy.</p>

    <p>The less you can use money and sugar-coated bullets to try to buy other people's feelings.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of impolite behavior. It is also a kind of disrespect for others.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Chief Zhuo. My trip today was well worth it! I understand everything!"</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Mr. Boss Sun bowed to Zhuo Yi respectfully: "General Director Zhuo, please rest assured about today's matter. God knows! I will rot in my stomach for everything!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun, you're very polite." Zhuo Yi smiled and returned the favor with a cupped fist.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun laughed and shouted: "Immortal luck!" Then he waved his sleeves and left.</p>

    <p>Looking at Boss Sun's retreating back, Zhuo Yi also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"Brother, are you sure you won't be angry..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei walked out of the office. He had just been eavesdropping for a long time.</p>

    <p>"As long as we have crispy noodles, everything is easy to discuss. Mr. Sun is a sensible person. There should be some more flattering methods..." Zhuo Yi touched his chin.</p>

    <p>In fact, he didn't dare to guarantee that something magical would happen later...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Songhai First Military Medical Hospital.</p>

    <p>After Zhao Qingxian was detained for several days, he was released on bail under the arrangement of Sun Rong. He was admitted to the hospital for a physical examination.</p>

    <p>The earth is too dangerous.</p>

    <p>He just arrived here. He did nothing and was accused of being a criminal suspect of "forced molestation of men."</p>

    <p>What a miserable word.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhao. Because your identity information cannot be found so far, you are still within the scope of our strict monitoring."</p>

    <p>In front of the bed, a police officer said seriously: "After all inspections are completed, you will be restricted to our specific apartment. You will be supervised by a special supervisor."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "Then when can I get rid of suspicion..."</p>

    <p>"It's hard to say."</p>

    <p>The police officer spread his hands and said. He stared at Zhao Qingxian: "Be honest. A doctor will come over to check your body later."</p>

    <p>He was not worried that Zhao Qingxian would run away, because Zhao Qingxian had an anklet version of a spirit-binding lock on his feet. With most of his spiritual power being restricted, Zhao Qingxian had no way to go.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian had no choice but to lie down obediently.</p>

    <p>As soon as the police officer left, Zhao Qingxian saw a man covered in bandages...</p>

    <p>The seriously ill patient was pushed to the bed next to him by a female nurse.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than Fan Xing...</p>

    <p>After many surgeries in the hospital, Fan Xing's recovery is in good condition. However, there is still a long way to go before he fully recovers.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if Fan Xing fully recovers afterwards... for Fan Xing, he is destined to have no happiness in his life.</p>

    <p>"Brother? Brother?" Zhao Qingxian tried to talk to Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>It wasn't because he was bored, but because he felt that he had found an opportunity in Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>Now, he is under inexplicable surveillance by the police. He has also been charged with unfounded charges. Under the premise of such a serious crime, his action plan on earth will encounter huge obstacles!</p>

    <p>In addition, the spirit-binding chains on his feet suppressed most of his spiritual power... It would definitely not be easy to escape.</p>

    <p>But after all, he is also a cultivator in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>Even if there are two anklet version of the Soul Binding Lock, it can still be done by casting some small spells.</p>

    <p>Now, Fan Xing was beside him. Although his body was damaged and he was unconscious, Zhao Qingxian found a chance.</p>

    <p>"I can only give it a try...{TemporaryÂ·Soul Changing Technique}!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian suddenly had his own plan in mind.</p>

    <p>This technique is actually a simplified version of the spell "Seize the Body."</p>

    <p>Use this on someone who is unconscious. The success rate will be greatly improved.</p>

    <p>Once successfully cast, the effect of soul exchange will be achieved within 72 hours.</p>

    <p>So, it doesn't matter if you are not satisfied with your body.</p>

    <p>After 72 hours, the body will switch back again.</p>

    <p>This is a simple body swap game!</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian used simple magic to make judgments. He believed that Fan Xing was not completely incapable of action. It was just that his depression hindered his actions.</p>

    <p>What is the specific situation? Just wait for the soul exchange to be completed and he will personally identify it.</p>

    <p>He also has some elixirs on hand. They should be able to help Fan Xing quickly recover from his physical injuries...</p>

    <p>These are the life-saving guys he brought from God's Domain. The effects are incomparable to those on earth!</p>

    <p>This is not the first time that he has had the idea of getting rid of this fat body!</p>

    <p>Because Zhao Qingxian gradually became more active, he had been given a lot of sugar since he was a child.</p>

    <p>This caused Zhao Qingxian's body to expand abnormally. Today it has reached the point where he is unable to control and restrain himself.</p>

    <p>The rules in the divine domain are strict. Zhao Qingxian never dared to have the unreasonable thought of taking over his body. Now on earth, he has found an opportunity.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Fan Xing's facial features are still okay.</p>

    <p>If he uses this face to seduce Liu Qingyi, Zhao Qingxian feels that not only can he hide his identity, but he can also greatly increase his success rate.</p>

    <p>"Brother... I'm sorry!" Zhao Qingxian thought about it.</p>

    <p>Finally, he finally made up his mind to take action against Fan Xing!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing saw Zhao Qingxian reaching out to him.</p>

    <p>... </p>

    <p>The first reaction is naturally to struggle.</p>

    <p>However, it was already too late. In an instant, a bright light burst out from the two people's heavenly caps.</p>

    <p>Soul exchange. Completed!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing's soul returned to Zhao Qingxian's body. At this moment, his hand still maintained its position on Fan Xing's body.</p>

    <p>The young police officer was shocked when he entered the door. He quickly pulled Zhao Qingxian away: "You pervert... I knew you wouldn't even let a man go!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Fan Xing felt aggrieved after being transferred into Zhao Qingxian's body.</p>

    <p>He was speechless at all. The reason was that Zhao Qingxian imposed a speech-silencing spell on himself before the soul exchange. As a result, Fan Xing was unable to speak at all in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>"Successful! At this time, Zhao Qingxian successfully grabbed Fan Xing's body.</p>

    <p>However, after a brief visit, the smile on Zhao Qingxian's face gradually solidified...</p>

    <p>Wipe!</p>

    <p>This man has no balls!</p>

    <p>This time he lost money!</p>
