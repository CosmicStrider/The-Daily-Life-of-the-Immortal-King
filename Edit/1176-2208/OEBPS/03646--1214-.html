  <h1>Chapter 1214 Today happens to be Dog Food Day in reality</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this time, the mechanical eye in the building has accurately transmitted the visitors to the security command center of the Huaguo Shuilian Group Building. The information about Wang Ling's visit has been transmitted here and projected on the big screen.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan waited in the command center for a long time. He had been waiting for Wang Ling to come over.</p>

    <p>Why did Wang Ling become the representative of Number 60 High School and come to visit Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>In fact, this is also within Boss Sun's plan.</p>

    <p>The man in charge of the command center wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun has been plotting the plan since last night.</p>

    <p>Including contacting the parents of the delegation members and using evil money to bribe them to take their children to visit relatives tomorrow. They also gave each parent a gift box of elixirs from the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Everything I did was just to help Miss Sun Rong have a chance to have close contact with a young man...</p>

    <p>"Master, is he the person you are looking for?" the younger brother asked.</p>

    <p>His name is Jiang Xiaoche. The number one secretary-general next to Mr. Boss Sun. He is also the commander-in-chief of the Huaguo Shuilian Group Security Command Center.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Xiaoche. That's him." Sun Yiyuan nodded.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this is the first time Jiang Xiaoche has seen Boss Sun look so serious.</p>

    <p>In short, this classmate Wang Ling is obviously a very special existence to Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Because almost all the boys who try to get close to Sun Rong, their security command center has moderate intervention and obstruction. Only the situation with Wang Ling is exactly the opposite.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun not only did not obstruct, but also tried to create opportunities to increase the relationship and interaction between the two.</p>

    <p>This seems incredible to Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>But thinking about it carefully, Jiang Xiaoche suddenly felt that maybe this matter had a lot to do with the "yin and yang death calamity" on the girl.</p>

    <p>The immortal fortune teller once said that the yin and yang death catastrophe is the biggest catastrophe in Sun Rong's life.</p>

    <p>The one who sets up the curse is born at the beginning of the year. The one who breaks the curse is born at the end of the year...</p>

    <p>When Xia Ming first appeared, Boss Sun always suspected that he was the one who created the curse, so he always had a very bad attitude towards Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>However, judging from recent signs, Xia Ming does not seem to be the one who set up the curse.</p>

    <p>At present, the only reliable information that Mr. Boss Sun has obtained is that Wang Ling has a high probability of being the one to break the curse.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Creating opportunities is necessary.</p>

    <p>If the identity of Wang Ling is true, then the closer you are to Sun Rong, the better.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoche. Think of a way to keep him." Mr. Boss Sun said seriously while staring at the picture on the screen.</p>

    <p>"How long do you want to stay?" Jiang Xiaoche asked.</p>

    <p>"It's best to stay the night."</p>

    <p>"Sleep overnight..." Jiang Xiaoche's mouth twitched. He never expected that it would reach this point!</p>

    <p>"I know this request may be a bit excessive. And the parents may not agree. If you really can't keep him, it would be good to stay a little longer." Boss Sun sighed and said, "If the boy has any other requests, And try my best to satisfy him."</p>

    <p>"Children these days all like snacks. Do you want to send some over?" Jiang Xiaoche suggested.</p>

    <p>"Eh... It's not impossible. But forget about ordinary snacks. All of them are imported high-end snacks. Our Huaguo Shuilian Group still has an identity!"</p>

    <p>"Okay, sir."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has experienced the embarrassment of a man and a woman living alone in the same room. He is not good at words. He does not know how to flirt with girls like some emotionally calculating boys. He was even slow and dull at one time.</p>

    <p>However, for Sun Rong, the appearance of Wang Ling was a huge surprise.</p>

    <p>On the hospital bed. Sun Rong sat up straight in an instant. She blinked her eyes and looked at the door in disbelief: "Wang Ling. Classmate?"</p>

    <p>The girl had heard that Number 60 High School would send a representative to visit her. But she never expected that this representative would actually be Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling scratched his head. Then he took out the condolences sent by everyone.</p>

    <p>"Did everyone give these to me?"Sun Rong was very surprised.</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"Let me see what's there." Sun Rong opened the box happily.</p>

    <p>Although nothing in the box is valuable, every gift is absolutely representative.</p>

    <p>The girl could probably tell who sent it just by looking at it.</p>

    <p>"These pink dumbbells must have been given by Chen Chao! There are also silkworm chrysalises in this incubator. It seems that the species is a seven-color butterfly? Fortunately, you didn't bring Er Ha with you. Otherwise, I think it can't help but think about it on the way. Eat it!" Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The courtesy was light but the affection was heavy. The warmth of friendship made the depression she had accumulated all morning disappear in an instant. There was a warm feeling all over her body.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that she saw two packs of original crispy noodles in the box at a glance.</p>

    <p>Although in order to stay in shape, Sun Rong rarely eats snacks. However, given her understanding of Wang Ling, the girl knows that this is probably the most cherished thing by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling gave me such a precious gift. So what do you want?"</p>

    <p>After receiving a gift, it is natural to return the favor. As the future heir of the group, Sun Rong is naturally well versed in etiquette.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong will return other people's gifts in person after returning to school in two days.</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling happened to be here. She decided to return it on the spot!</p>

    <p>To be honest, the girl was really confused by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He just came to send condolences on behalf of everyone. He didn't even think about asking the girl in return. And the most important thing is that he didn't even think that he was short of anything... Well, if I had to say it, he was quite short of pocket money.</p>

    <p>But the question is. Can he speak up about this?</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, please sit down first. If you want anything, just tell me directly."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled slightly. She pressed the call button. The mechanical eye wandering outside came to the ward and made a cup of tea for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling sat down obediently. Holding the tea cup, he felt the overflowing aroma of tea and the heat coming to his face. His mind went blank.</p>

    <p>"For example, magic weapons, elixirs, technological products?" the girl further prompted.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The clothes, pants, shoes?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Or a house, a car, or land?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Immortal ships, aircraft carriers, and laser missiles are also available!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Why is there such a thing!</p>

    <p>"It's okay, classmate Wang Ling. You can think about it slowly." Sun Rong smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Then, the girl opened the nutritious lunch box prepared by Li Youyue.</p>

    <p>The color matching of the side dishes in the bento is very exquisite. The meat and vegetables are evenly distributed. It looks very appetizing! But after carefully observing the weight of the bento, Sun Rong's face instantly turned red. She looked at Sun Rong Wang Ling. Feeling a little overwhelmed: "Classmate Wang Ling...this lunch box. It seems to be...for two people!"</p>

    <p>Now she finally understands what the text message Li Youyue sent to her around noon, that is, before Wang Ling came, meant!</p>

    <p>The text message read: I can only help you so far! Classmate Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>...</p>
