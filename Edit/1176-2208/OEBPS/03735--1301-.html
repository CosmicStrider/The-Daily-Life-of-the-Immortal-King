  <h1>Chapter 1301 The evil-minded ancient Golden Men!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Regarding the Earth Upgrade Plan meeting on December 1st, the discussion was completed amidst cheerful laughter from everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"Seniors, fellow Taoists from the Office of Strategic Deception will stay here. I will report this matter to my superiors as soon as possible and make arrangements. Please rest assured." In front of the gate of the Office of Strategic Deception, Guo Ping turned around and bowed to everyone.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Academician Guo." Lord Diulei returned the gift.</p>

    <p>Then everyone watched as Guo Ping drove a small immortal boat and turned into a streak of light and drove away.</p>

    <p>The energy source used by this small immortal boat is Wang Ling's hair. It saves energy, reduces emissions, and is super environmentally friendly.</p>

    <p>The location has been determined. The next step of the monk, Lord Diulei and Miss Ajuan's plan is to set up an introduction in the Desert of Bones.</p>

    <p>They have to find a way to deploy a device to guide the "Chaos Tribulation Transcendence Cannon" onto the Chaos Egg.</p>

    <p>This device was completed by the monk in the 3909th lifetime.</p>

    <p>He drew the drawings in the 3906th century.</p>

    <p>Then I spent another lifetime trying to verify whether my idea was feasible.</p>

    <p>Finally, the device was developed in the 3909th century.</p>

    <p>It's just that the layout is a little complicated.</p>

    <p>Because the devices are all in pieces, he needs manpower.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Miss Ajuan can help him with this.</p>

    <p>The remaining people. For example, Fang Xing, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, Zhenyuan Immortal and a few juniors from the God's Domain.</p>

    <p>It was divided into two groups of people.</p>

    <p>Yibo is responsible for guarding the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>The other wave is responsible for guarding the area around the Desert of Bones and placing it outside the boundary.</p>

    <p>To ensure that on the day of earth upgrade.</p>

    <p>No fish slipped through the net and entered the core area that was about to receive a frontal impact from the Chaos Tribulation Transcendence cannon.</p>

    <p>Before setting out to set up the device, the monk gave a handle to Zhuo Yi: "Master. This is..."</p>

    <p>"External control device for Buddha's Golden Lotus."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said, "I see you holding the Golden Lotus all the time. I look very tired."</p>

    <p>A few minutes later. Heavenly Dao used the {Great Sacrifice Technique} to burn the handle to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong gained the ability to control the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>It's like flying a small aircraft. Very fun.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this handle also has a stealth mode, which can make the entire Buddha Golden Lotus disappear in the air instantly.</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng is such a genius!" Sun Rong marveled at the monk's power.</p>

    <p>She quickly mastered the control skills of the controller and completed various difficult flying maneuvers in the "Buddha Golden Lotus."</p>

    <p>"It's so fun!" Such fun is not common for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As the future successor of the group. Sun Rong is usually followed by a bunch of bodyguards almost everywhere.</p>

    <p>Things like posture aircraft, Huaguo Shuilian Group will hand over to dedicated personnel.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong usually can't touch the joystick.</p>

    <p>After getting tired of playing, Sun Rong drove the Buddha Golden Lotus and stopped steadily in front of Zhuo Yi: "Zhuo Yi Senior. Can I... go somewhere?"</p>

    <p>"For the sake of safety, Sun Rong, it's better not to run around alone. If you want to go somewhere, seniors and Heavenly Dao will accompany you." Zhuo Yi nodded. replied.</p>

    <p>"I want to go back to the hospital and see grandpa." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"This is human nature."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded: "But Mr. Sun doesn't know about Master. So I hope Sun Rong will pay more attention when she sees Mr. Sun."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, senior Zhuo Yi." Sun Rong agreed with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>First Military Medical Hospital. Poor Boss Sun still has not given up his plan to organize expert consultation to rescue his granddaughter.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi and others rushed to the hospital again to see Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, who was driving the Buddha Golden Lotus behind Zhuo Yi, clearly felt that his grandfather had become much older.</p>

    <p>Even the hair on the temples has become paler...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi also saw this scene. He was very puzzled. He asked Sun Rong in a low voice in the mental space: "Sun Rong, school girl. I have something I don't know whether to ask or not."</p>

    <p>"Senior, please tell me..."</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, what Mr. Sun wears on his head should be a wig...Why does the wig turn white..."</p>

    <p>"Grandpa is wearing a bionic black technology wig. It can automatically adjust the hair color according to his mood." Sun Rong answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>I have to say that Mr. Boss Sun's current state is indeed a bit pitiful.</p>

    <p>He didn't know that the girl's soul had been sealed in the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun..." In the ward, Zhuo Yi took a step forward. He wanted to comfort Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>"No need to comfort me. It's been hard on you these days."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun sighed: "My granddaughter is lucky to have a large group of friends like you to care about her... Oh, by the way. Why didn't that Master Jin Deng come? I heard that the master came to the hospital before. He used magic to seal it. He inhabited my granddaughter's body and kept it intact. I should thank him."</p>

    <p>"This is just a delaying tactic. Master, I'm leaving for now because I'm still looking for a way to rescue Sun Rong's schoolmate."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>He looked at the haggard old man in front of him.</p>

    <p>Another question came to mind that I have always wanted to ask Mr. Boss Sun face to face.</p>

    <p>I just don't know if it's appropriate to bring it up now.</p>

    <p>So. Still hesitating.</p>

    <p>"If General Zhuo has anything to say, just say it." Sun Yiyuan seemed to see Zhuo Yi's thoughts.</p>

    <p>So far, he has regarded Zhuo Yi as one of his own.</p>

    <p>"I want to ask Mr. Sun. Who was the fortune teller who told Miss Sun's fortune back then?"</p>

    <p>"It's not that I don't want to say it. It's just that I can't remember it clearly."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun Yuezi herself feels very strange about this.</p>

    <p>He frowned: "This person seems to be in my mind all the time. But he doesn't seem to be here..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Sure enough.</p>

    <p>Everything is exactly as Master described.</p>

    <p>Previously, his master used King's Eyes to peek at the fortune teller in Boss Sun's memory. As a result, his vision was dim.</p>

    <p>That memory was obviously overwritten by someone before it happened.</p>

    <p>And this instigator is probably another master hidden in the earth.</p>

    <p>And the strength is very likely to be as good as Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the scene fell into a brief silence...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong drove the Buddha Golden Lotus to a steady stop behind Mr. Boss Sun. He had mixed feelings in his heart.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the familiar and heavy sound of chains came from the corridor again.</p>

    <p>"The ancient Golden Men are here again?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked. He immediately became extremely vigilant.</p>

    <p>"Senior Death Heavenly Dao. What is going on? Sun Rong The soul of the school girl was sealed in the Buddha's Golden Lotus by the master. They should have no way to locate the soul again!" Zhuo Yi was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao quickly made a judgment: "It's not for the soul!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiConfused: "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao frowned: "This is for the physical body..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked: "Isn't this Heavenly Dao supposed to be free from desires? Why is he still coveting the body of my Sun Rong school girl!?"</p>
