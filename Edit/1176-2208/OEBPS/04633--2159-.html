  <h1>Chapter 2159 Li Liyuan's score</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Since the earth's upgrade, the group of people who have been most affected are those who have stayed at the ninth level of True Immortal for a long time. With their talents, they can break through the current state long ago. It is just because they are shackled by spiritual energy. It's too late to break through.</p>

    <p>Among this group of people, there is no doubt that the sword master Yi Jianchuan is the representative.</p>

    <p>As for True Immortal, the impact may not be huge. But at least it has laid the foundation for the future of human monks all over the earth.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the people who are truly influenced and have broken through the realm are still a very small group of people on the earth today. Maybe not even 1%.</p>

    <p>But for realms below True Immortal. For example, Itinerant Immortal and others. Wang Ling feels that the intensity should still be there.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling saw a lot of Itinerant Immortals around him, and all of them were elite representatives from all walks of life. But Qingjiao was seriously injured after being kicked by him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>The kick he gave to the cabin door was really just a light kick. It was far less forceful than his slap.</p>

    <p>The result was this. They were all seriously injured...</p>

    <p>It seems that he thought too well of the Itinerant Immortals on Earth. Or maybe after the Earth was upgraded, Wang Ling felt that the standard for the Itinerant Immortal realm should be redefined.</p>

    <p>At least, you have to be able to half-kneel on the ground and talk even after receiving a gentle kick from yourself.</p>

    <p>This is the qualified Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>A Qingjiao lying directly on the ground bleeding from its seven holes and struggling to get up is obviously an unqualified Itinerant Immortal in the eyes of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Having said that, Wang Ling's kick should be regarded as self-defense.</p>

    <p>After all, the purpose of his kick was just to open the door of the game cabin. Who would have thought that that person was so close to the door of the game cabin.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he could not expect that his slight kick could bring such a high amount of critical damage.</p>

    <p>At this time, he sighed softly with his hands in his pockets and turned his red eyes to somewhere on the island.</p>

    <p>That's a hidden surveillance device.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling's eyes happened to meet the other members of the Four Elephants who were still stunned in the monitor.</p>

    <p>This young man... is looking here?</p>

    <p>Xiongwu looked at Wang Ling's gaze in the monitor. He was so nervous that his cheeks were sweating. He couldn't say a word.</p>

    <p>Everything was too shocking.</p>

    <p>Kicked the green dragon to the Naihe Bridge...</p>

    <p>"But the aura of the rising sun is still there in him. He is clearly a young man!" Beside him, Xue Hu thought that maybe they were thinking about things too complicated.</p>

    <p>Maybe this game cabin has a defense mechanism they couldn't imagine... When a stranger approaches, the self-defense system will be activated to eliminate the danger.</p>

    <p>But even if that's the case, that's unreasonable...</p>

    <p>This is just a game cabin. Even if it uses the highest level of technology, how could it be possible to destroy Itinerant Immortal like this by popping the door?</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal...</p>

    <p>This is the realm of being able to catch missiles with bare hands!</p>

    <p>"Don't panic... I'll go and meet this person for a while and I'll know the truth." Zhu? frowned. He wanted to test Wang Ling personally.</p>

    <p>However, he was intercepted by Xue Hu: "Leave this matter to me. I don't need to trouble my second brother to do anything. My Snow Magic Sword can be used for a fight!"</p>

    <p>Because the young man who landed on the island was very strange and did not dare to engage in close combat, Snow Tiger could only launch a test with a long-range attack.</p>

    <p>His Snow Magic Sword can control the weather of the four seasons. It is a top-notch holy weapon! Second only to the pseudo-double-level magic weapon!</p>

    <p>Snow Tiger has always been properly maintained, but he is reluctant to take it out and use it. He is afraid of wearing out the durability of the magic weapon. But now he did not expect that after re-executing it, he would actually use it on a young man.</p>

    <p>Without further ado, he immediately unfolded his hand. An icy blue leaf flashed with spiritual light in his palm. Then it suddenly enlarged and turned into a blue magic sword, which was held by Xue Hu in his palm.</p>

    <p>He held a law sword in his hand and his clothes fluttered. He did not enter the island directly. Instead, he found a wall in the underground space. He pierced the law sword directly through the wall into the deep rock formations and connected with the entire island.</p>

    <p>At the same time. Wang Ling saw snow starting to fall on this small island.</p>

    <p>The flying white snow fell from the sky, and it only targeted this small island. In less than two minutes, it became heavier and heavier, forming the appearance of a blizzard.</p>

    <p>The natural lake on the island freezes directly.</p>

    <p>As Bai Xue continued to accumulate in a short period of time, Qing Jiao's body was quickly submerged by Bai Xue. Then it turned into a spiritual light and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that this was a way to control the weather. By the way, he used the white snow as a blindfold to cast a spell to bring back his companion's body.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that the movement was a little slow. We should have gone directly to the island to take the people back. In this way, there might be a glimmer of hope.</p>

    <p>Manipulating spells and using spells to save people back. This has seriously delayed the rescue time.</p>

    <p>So in Wang Ling's opinion, this green dragon is probably dead...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the white snow falling from the sky. He was lost in thought for a while. As a child who grew up in the south, white snow is a rare thing for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the monitor, everyone in Sixiang watched closely the movement of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now Snow Tiger uses the Snow Magic Sword to activate the underground spiritual veins under the island to trigger weather phenomena. The heavy snowfall has caused the temperature of the island to fall into an abnormal state.</p>

    <p>It's over 50 degrees below zero!</p>

    <p>Such a young man, no matter how talented he is, is at best in the early stages of Golden Core... and still unstable. Under such extreme temperatures, such thin clothing should not last long.</p>

    <p>But what surprised Snow Tiger, Zhu Hu, and Xiong Wu was that they actually saw Wang Ling building a snowman on the island on the monitor...</p>

    <p>Xiongwu rubbed his eyes and made sure he saw it correctly.</p>

    <p>This boy was really building a snowman in front of them!</p>

    <p>And it has a nose and eyes.</p>

    <p>This is a large snowman.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly pinched out the limbs. Then began to create the body out of white snow.</p>

    <p>"No... this seems to be more than just a snowman..." Xuehu frowned. He felt that the things created by Wang Ling seemed a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>The corner of Zhu?'s mouth twitched: "How do I feel? This is a Gundam..."</p>

    <p>To be precise, it's not necessarily a Gundam. It's a mecha of the same type that is very similar to a Gundam.</p>

    <p>It's hard to believe. A young man was not afraid of the cold at all in such an environment. He even managed to build a thirty-meter tall tower with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>"This... who is this person..." Even Xuehu was frightened at this moment. He had never seen anything like this before.</p>

    <p>At this moment, I saw Wang Ling slowly walking towards Gundam's neck.</p>

    <p>He slipped straight in. It was like wearing clothes, with only one head exposed. A pair of dead fish eyes stared straight ahead.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a scene that shocked everyone even more happened.</p>

    <p>Rumble...</p>

    <p>I saw the next second. Wang Ling was wearing a thirty-meter white snow mecha that he had kneaded. He stood up from his lying position!</p>
