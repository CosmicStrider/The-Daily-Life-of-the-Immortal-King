  <h1>Chapter 1254 Sword of Destiny</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Star Messenger would never have dreamed that the battle would be over before it even started.</p>

    <p>Mother Teresa was an honest person. She had actually heard the sound of Xing Xing vomiting blood. But she thought of Xing Xing telling her not to look back before, so she stayed where she was without moving.</p>

    <p>"Xingxing. Are you okay..." To be honest. She was nervous.</p>

    <p>As one of the Foundation's envoys, she watched helplessly as an envoy was seriously injured before he officially joined the battlefield. This feeling made Teresa very complicated.</p>

    <p>Is this Zhuo Yi. a monster?</p>

    <p>"If you need my help, just ask. I know some treatment methods." Teresa said.</p>

    <p>In fact, she is not a combat type, but an auxiliary nanny. She is even known as the "Mother of the Stars" in the nanny world.</p>

    <p>"No need...you can't help me..." Xingxing said weakly. He had already taken the tonic he carried with him.</p>

    <p>But the most this medicine can do is help him recover from his internal injuries.</p>

    <p>His visual impairment is probably irreversible.</p>

    <p>The right eye was directly blind. The remaining left eye was blurred to about 2000Â° myopia. It was almost the same as being blind.</p>

    <p>Now the messenger of the star position opens his eyes. There is only a chilling light left in the left eyeball.</p>

    <p>It took him hundreds of years to hone his eyes to peer into the heavens. Unexpectedly, he suffered a devastating blow in an instant.</p>

    <p>He even expected that there was something strange about Zhuo Yi. He didn't dare to look more.</p>

    <p>It was just a flashback. Just a glance.</p>

    <p>As a result, it ended up like this.</p>

    <p>"What remains is judgment and fate..." Teresa sighed.</p>

    <p>He felt that the envoy of the Fool position was also a master. He just didn't know why the judge's envoy suddenly excluded him.</p>

    <p>But Teresa knew very well. She wanted to survive in the Foundation. The best way was not to ask any more questions.</p>

    <p>Just go with the flow.</p>

    <p>Her original purpose of joining the foundation was just for the high remuneration offered to her by the foundation.</p>

    <p>In order to reward Mingzhe and protect yourself, it is the wisest choice.</p>

    <p>So when she saw the vehicle in front of her was seriously injured, she had no intention of rescuing him.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is too scary. Going up at this time will mean death.</p>

    <p>Today's foundations basically rely on one person to judge and have the final say.</p>

    <p>Risking her own life to save a chariot. Teresa felt there was no need to take this risk.</p>

    <p>She even thought Zhuo Yi played well!</p>

    <p>This scumbag who treats women as toys should be taught a lesson, right?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the chariot was buried naked in the soil.</p>

    <p>He is already useless.</p>

    <p>The spiritual root was cut off by Zhuo Yi. All realms were lost.</p>

    <p>In addition, his body is seriously injured. Now even an ordinary person can give him the final blow.</p>

    <p>And now. Chariot has obviously gone crazy.</p>

    <p>The double blow to the body and spirit made it impossible for him to accept what he was seeing.</p>

    <p>"I am immortal...I am really immortal..." He kept mumbling these words. His eyes were already blank.</p>

    <p>After this incident is over, Chariot will probably spend the rest of his life in a mental hospital.</p>

    <p>To deal with such a person. Zhuo Yi thinks this is the best punishment.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Zhuo Yi once again marveled at Jingke's terrifying power.</p>

    <p>It can cut off the spiritual roots without harming the life. Except for the master of the sword spirit, no sword spirit in the world can achieve such accuracy...</p>

    <p>If an ordinary cultivator has his spiritual roots cut off, he will definitely die.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi heard a few scattered bursts of applause coming from outside the school gate.</p>

    <p>He raised his head. In the direction of his vision, he saw a man in a black cloak approaching him.</p>

    <p>The man clapped his hands as he walked into Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>He took off his big hood. Zhuo Yi saw the black facial mask under the hood. The word "ming" was written in red letters on it.</p>

    <p>Judging from the hair color, this seems to be an Asian.</p>

    <p>The Sage Immortal Book has sent Zhuo Yi almost all the information on the Foundation's emissaries.</p>

    <p>Including the "virtual whiteness" of the judgment position.</p>

    <p>But only this messenger of fate. The Book of Sage Immortal is still under investigation.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the messenger of destiny appears.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is also speculating on his identity.</p>

    <p>Judging from the hair color, this person seems to be an Asian.</p>

    <p>"Are you from Huaxiu?"</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo is really smart."</p>

    <p>Under the face of the fortune character, the messenger of destiny makes a voice. This is obviously a changed voice.</p>

    <p>This messenger of destiny seems to be hiding his identity.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that the foundation's envoys were not all foreigners." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He holds Jingke in his hand. He is ready for battle.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Are you here for the chariot? Revenge. Let's get started."</p>

    <p>"Let's talk first. I'm not here for the chariot. I'm here to fight for myself."</p>

    <p>The Messenger of Destiny said: "Before the chariot came, I had already expected such a situation. It's just more tragic than I imagined."</p>

    <p>Listening to Destiny's speech. Zhuo Yi felt that the tone of this person's words was somewhat familiar. It seemed that he had known him before. But he couldn't tell who the other person was.</p>

    <p>"You said you were fighting for yourself?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was in no hurry to take action. He wanted to get more information out of Destiny.</p>

    <p>"I have taken a fancy to this wooden sword of yours. If you can give it to me, it will not only avoid a battle, but also save your own life." He said this calmly while wearing a face mask with a life character on it. But it is different from the infinite arrogance of Chariot and Snake. Instead, it seems that victory is really within their grasp.</p>

    <p>"Snake, Chariot. They all died in my hands. Are you confident that you can beat me?" Zhuo Yi looked at him.</p>

    <p>This messenger of destiny is the same as the chariot. His breath is pure. It has not been invaded by ethereal spirits.</p>

    <p>However, I have experience in fighting chariots. Zhuo Yi is also wary of the magic weapons that fate may throw at me.</p>

    <p>The people in the Foundation are all a bunch of lunatics.</p>

    <p>God knows if fate has injected imaginary spirits into his magic weapon.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm different from low-handed people like Chariot. I have real abilities." The messenger of destiny took a step forward at this moment.</p>

    <p>Then he used his weapon. It was an emerald-green bamboo. The head of the bamboo was sharpened, like a sharp blade.</p>

    <p>Under the dim light, the whole body exudes a brilliance like amber glass.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi instantly became more vigilant.</p>

    <p>The road to simplicity.</p>

    <p>The simpler a weapon looks, the more powerful it may be.</p>

    <p>Isn't this the peach wood sword in his hand?</p>

    <p>"Do you know the Sword of Destiny, Mr. Zhuo?" At this time, the Messenger of Destiny raised his head and looked at Zhuo Yi: "I have a feeling. I feel that the Sword of Destiny in my hand is different from the one in your hand. Taomu sword. Maybe it comes from the same place."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, his whole person disappeared into thin air.</p>

    <p>In a flash, he suddenly appeared behind Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>"The response was slow, General Zhuo. But you were stabbed by me. This is also fate."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the bamboo sword immediately pierced the sword energy wrapped around Zhuo Yi's body and stabbed towards his kidney!</p>

    <p>A feeling of foreign body invasion came from behind. Blood dripped down the pierced bamboo tip.</p>

    <p>"It can actually pierce Master Jingke's sword energy..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was secretly shocked. He gritted his teeth and pulled away from his body.</p>

    <p>"No. Not pricking. Just ignoring."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jingke's voice sounded from Zhuo Yi's body.</p>

    <p>"Ignore the sword energy? What the hell is this..."</p>

    <p>Hearing Jingke's words. Zhuo Yi was even more surprised.</p>

    <p>Jingke's voice was calm: "It's okay. Bai Qiao and I are combined. We can beat each other."</p>

    <p>Are they finally getting together?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>He endured the pain of his kidney being punctured and inserted the mahogany sword into its scabbard.</p>
