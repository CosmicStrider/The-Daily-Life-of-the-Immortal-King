  <h1>Chapter 1873 Meeting an old friend forever</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dongda's words were so true that she was speechless for a moment and couldn't say a word.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the eternal world, even those Buddhist disciples in the modern world of cultivation. The money in the merit box has never belonged to the Buddha.</p>

    <p>As the sage of Buddhism, Monk Jin Deng should know this very well.</p>

    <p>But why did Madam Shanxiu, the leader of the Immortal Mountain Sect, make an appointment with them at the temple?</p>

    <p>Is it because she is a believer of one of the Four Emperors? Or does this move have a deeper meaning?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. He was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>He had a vague intuition that this Yama Hideo was not simple. He might even be a fellow traveler with them.</p>

    <p>Of course. These are just Wang Ling's own guesses.</p>

    <p>He had a hunch that the next trip to the temple would be extremely lively.</p>

    <p>When the speeding carriage landed, Wang Ling saw a building that looked extremely mysterious and magnificent. The rolling walls of the ivory-white temple were carved with various runes from ancient times. The environment inside was very nice. Small bridge and flowing water. Rockery fountain.</p>

    <p>According to Zhang Zhui, the temple architecture in the Central Region integrates the styles of the four regions. It is a relatively special existence. It is designed to allow believers to worship the emperor of their faith devoutly.</p>

    <p>Compared with ordinary temples, the Central Region Temple has three additional halls. They are located in the four directions of southeast, northwest and northwest. The specifications of all temples are the same. Even the building area has strict requirements. All did exactly the same thing.</p>

    <p>This is also considered from the perspective of appeasing believers.</p>

    <p>After arriving here, Emperor Dongdai silently observed the reaction near the temple. There were many believers here, the incense was lingering, and there was an endless stream of cultivators making wishes.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda knew that besides Mrs. Shanxiu, there would be other people looking for him.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun would definitely not miss such an opportunity. Even though the guards of the ancient city were terrifying, they could not deter the prince of the Western Regions.</p>

    <p>If the other party really dares to attack directly in the Central Territory, and the most important thing is that this is a temple with a statue of the Western Emperor. If he chooses to attack here, he might even get the remote blessing of the Western Emperor.</p>

    <p>But Emperor Dongda is not very worried. There is still the senior named Wang hidden in his body!</p>

    <p>This is what he can use now. It is the greatest killing weapon in all eternity. Once used, it can crush everything.</p>

    <p>But after all, the gathering of the four emperors has not officially started yet. Emperor Dongda does not want to reveal his identity so early.</p>

    <p>After all, no one has seen the true appearance of the great emperor. They all rely on the Dharma to identify his identity.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if he really faced off against King Tiankun in the future, Emperor Dongda would not intend to use his Dharma to fight.</p>

    <p>To deal with a small prince, asking a great emperor to directly use his dharma to crush him would make him feel very shameless.</p>

    <p>As an emperor, Emperor Dongda rarely comes to places like the temple. After all, it would feel strange to visit the temple of himself. But today, due to the needs of the historical process, he had to come here to visit.</p>

    <p>A huge temple. There are four orderly long queues lined up in the courtyard. There are ancient city guards here to maintain continuity. Everyone stands in front of the temple of the emperor they believe in and waits devoutly to worship. There is no chaos or noise at all.</p>

    <p>"They are quite harmonious. I thought they would fight." Wang Ying joked.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed and said: "After all, there are guards from the ancient city. Most people don't dare to act recklessly. In addition, many people believe that if they act recklessly here, they will be punished by the Four Emperors, which will cause their realm to stagnate."</p>

    <p>"Is there such a saying?" Wang Ying was curious.</p>

    <p>"Actually, no. It's all psychological." Emperor Dongda personally clarified.</p>

    <p>There seem to be many followers of the Four Emperors. But basically only a small part of these believers are die-hard fans. Most people actually act according to their hearts.</p>

    <p>If the wish you make comes true, you will only worship a certain emperor for a period of time.</p>

    <p>If the wish you made does not come true, you will immediately switch to other emperors and become fans of other emperors.</p>

    <p>Even in the eons of time. These are very real things.</p>

    <p>Although they seem to be disrespectful to the emperor, there are many believers. As emperors, they are not so small-minded as to specifically target a certain believer.</p>

    <p>"Pray to Emperor Dongda! Bless the descendants of my Chen family. May all your wishes come true! Follow your words!" As soon as they entered the threshold of the temple gate, everyone immediately heard the voice coming from the palace of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>A large string of rosary beads hung around his neck. A bald middle-aged man was lying on the ground with an exaggerated posture, prostrating devoutly.</p>

    <p>Even though everyone's posture of worshiping is different and there is no particular set of rules, this man still attracted the attention of many people because he was too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>"Look, it's such a weird wish again. I haven't even said it. How can I protect the descendants of the Chen family from delaying the law..." Dongda complained in the team's voice skills.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a long time, Wang Ling remained silent.</p>

    <p>Because when it comes to the Chen family who "do as they say." The first impression that comes to Wang Ling's mind is Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>He wasn't sure if there was any connection between the middle-aged man in front of him and Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>After all, this has spanned eternity. If Chen Chao is really a descendant of this Chen family, it would be a coincidence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was secretly cursing in his heart. Immediately following the middle-aged man surnamed Chen, another woman with a rich body began to pay homage to the statue of Emperor Dongda: "Pray to Emperor Dongda! Bless the descendants of my Guo family. I have a wide network of connections." Have no worries about food and clothing. Can carry forward the spirit animal breeding business!"</p>

    <p>Now it's not just Wang Ling. Even Sun Rong was shocked: "Classmate Wang Ling. Why do I feel that this senior sounds so much like Guo Hao..."</p>

    <p>"It can't be such a coincidence, right?" Wang Zhen also found it incredible.</p>

    <p>This is an eternity. This time span is too big. It can be passed down from that period to the modern era... what a powerful bloodline power.</p>

    <p>Moreover, most of the Eternals were later imprisoned in the Corpse Map by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Although it has been found that not all the Eternals are locked up inside. There are still a small number of Eternals. Even people of royal blood among the Eternals are fleeing. But the probability of surviving and leaving behind the fire is simply as low as dust...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never believed that there could be any coincidence when the time span was so long. But the situation before him had to make him have some doubts and doubts about such a coincidence.</p>

    <p>"Dad, let's go. It's useless for you to do this." At this time, a short-haired young man ran over from the side and helped up the middle-aged man with a big rosary hanging around his neck.</p>

    <p>"Ren'er must not be rude. This is the emperor! He will hear our voices!" The middle-aged man named Chen looked pious.</p>

    <p>"But it's unrealistic to think that you could just wish for what you want. That's the same thing as getting whatever you want. Unless the Great Eastern Emperor himself appears in this temple, I certainly don't believe that he will fulfill my wish." Chen Ren sighed.</p>

    <p>Dongda: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>
