  <h1>Chapter 2204 Jiujiu, who has little talent and little knowledge</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The fate between Lao Huang and the Infinite Universe Group seems to be somewhat unreasonable. The root of everything is that Lao Huang was successfully "resurrected" from the virtual character identity in the real world by Wang Ling. He officially became a real person. After being admitted, I have the idea of finding a job. That's all.</p>

    <p>But the series of intricate interest entanglements involved behind the scenes were unexpected by Wang Ling, Sun Rong. After parting ways with Huang Tingjian, a powerful headhunter.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat in Lao Huang's car and deduce it with his fingers. Then his brows knitted together.</p>

    <p>It was just a micro-expression. It was still keenly captured by Sun Rong. After all, when you are with the person you like, it is really difficult not to look at the other person's face.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong has shown great restraint. She is always telling herself to calm down and not show that worthless look. But there is no way... Wang Ling is around. She just knows how to do it. Can't help but take a second look.</p>

    <p>No, she even saw the frown on her face. She found that Wang Ling was not completely devoid of emotional reactions. She didn't know if it was because of Talisman's looseness. She found that Wang Ling's expression had changed recently. It's much richer. Although in most cases the expression only changes in a moment.</p>

    <p>"Is there any problem?" Sun Rong asked as he looked at Wang Ling with a smile.</p>

    <p>"..." Facing Sun Rong's question. Wang Ling fell silent.</p>

    <p>Because he figured out that the plot behind this matter was indeed complicated. He thought it was just a knot. But when he followed the knot, he found a huge fishing net. It almost connected many things together by looking at the small and seeing the big.</p>

    <p>The reason why this Universe Infinite Group recruits talented people is not only related to the secret module formation arranged by the octopus men captured by the river on the way to Lao Huang's house by Wang Ling, Sun Rong. It even involves the center of the earth. Plan and Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>If you want, Wang Ling can directly follow these nodes that you have deduced. Break them into pieces one by one and go straight to see clearly.</p>

    <p>But that would be too boring.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling finally retracted his idea of continuing the deduction. Anyway, the general context of the matter has been clarified. Everything else may as well just let nature take its course.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this is also the current situation created by Wang Ling's original choice.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't brought Lao Huang back to reality from the virtual world and given him a real life, then nothing like this would have happened.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the appearance of Lao Huang is like a chess piece accidentally laid by Wang Ling. And it will play a vital role in the entire chessboard.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Southern suburb of Songhai. Nanxian Village. A young man in simple clothes works relying on the beautiful landscape of Nanxian Village. He is a famous craftsman on the Internet. He is famous on the Internet for publishing various short videos on the platform.</p>

    <p>The works he published include, but are not limited to, cultivating spiritual plants, raising spiritual animals in captivity, and using natural resources to cook various farmhouse delicacies. Wait a minute! Network ID: Jiujiu who has little talent and little knowledge.</p>

    <p>There is a nice male voice dubbing him in these videos. Jiujiu himself can hardly speak. Most people's impression of this video blogger is that he covers his eyes with a piece of white gauze and works. Cooperation The natural scenery of the pastoral mountains and rivers behind it always makes a group of monks who work hard in the city imagine and yearn for it.</p>

    <p>No one knows that this inexperienced Jiujiu's true identity is another headhunter who is as famous as Huang Tingjian in the cultivation circle: Zhi Jiunian.</p>

    <p>With the short video income from Tianyuan Live, Zhi Jiunian has a certain self-sufficient economic foundation to complete his greater career.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, I will hold a live broadcast of bubble tea. I will introduce the tea brewing method to the fans in the live broadcast room. Then I will promote the effects of drinking tea for a long time. For example, it can cleanse the marrow, exercise, and purify the spiritual roots. Then I will bring some goods. Hang a few tea links in your live broadcast room. Just give them away and you can earn more than 100,000 Huaxiu national currency a day.</p>

    <p>This money is so easy to come by, which makes Zhi Jiunian happy. Of course, the main reason why he can do this job is that he caught the trend of short video live broadcast. As long as he is on the trend, even a pig can get up.</p>

    <p>He leisurely brewed tea, sipping tea in such a leisurely landscape. With his handsome appearance, he gathered many live broadcast room viewers.</p>

    <p>A live broadcast lasts no more than two hours. When the time is up, a beautiful girl in ancient costume enters the picture. She respectfully salutes everyone in front of the camera. Then with a smile, she says: "Thank you everyone for your support in revitalizing rural areas." As a new farmer, Jiujiu has the confidence to lead the villagers of Nanxian Village towards common prosperity. Today's live broadcast in the afternoon is almost time. We will start the broadcast on time in the evening. See you there or not."</p>

    <p>The barrage in the live broadcast room began to scroll rapidly with the appearance of the little girl.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Jiujiu's sister! My sister's voice is so beautiful. I waited so long in the live broadcast room just to wait for my sister to appear!"</p>

    <p>"After Jiujiu has finished broadcasting, can my sister live broadcast for a while longer?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. The time is too short. Only two hours."</p>

    <p>From beginning to end, the little girl always had a smile on her face. She never answered anyone's words and directly turned off the live broadcast button.</p>

    <p>After seeing that the live broadcast was completely shut down, she breathed a sigh of relief. She looked at Zhi Jiunian aside and said with a sigh: "Boss, Brother Lu Jing's interview didn't go well. The Universe Infinite Group doesn't seem to have much interest in them. Moreover, Know their intention of entering the group."</p>

    <p>There is actually no biological relationship between her and Zhi Jiunian. It is just the bond between the boss and the assistant. However, for the effect of the live broadcast, Lu Xiao set up a sister persona for herself to facilitate communication with the audience in the live broadcast room. They communicate.</p>

    <p>"As expected."</p>

    <p>Over at the teahouse, Lu Jing, headed by Huang Mao, was blocked from interviewing the Universe Infinite Group. This was within Zhi Jiunian's expectation. The boss behind the Universe Infinite Group was also an old fox. He had heard about it for a long time.</p>

    <p>Anchors like him can have all the power on the Internet. Many people respect them as teachers. But if they are the truly powerful bosses in the industry, they will not treat them as a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>Zhi Jiunian did not take off his blindfold. He was wearing a white robe. He picked up the bamboo pole beside him and asked: "Lu Jing's side. If you really can't get in for the interview, just ask them to come back. Apart from this, you should There's something else you want to tell me."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Boss."</p>

    <p>Lu Xiao nodded. He said with a somewhat solemn expression, "I just received the news during the live broadcast. The group of octopus men by the river were captured by the Cultivation Inspection Department."</p>

    <p>"captured?" Zhi Jiunian frowned.</p>

    <p>"Yes. It is said that two high school students passing by caught them and reported illegal construction. Then Zhuo Yi came and killed them all."</p>

    <p>Lu Xiao said: "Currently, the employer is very dissatisfied. And because of the capture of this group of octopus men, the module array may be leaked. If the Cultivation Inspection Department continues to investigate thoroughly, it may mess up the situation. Even more chaotic..."</p>
