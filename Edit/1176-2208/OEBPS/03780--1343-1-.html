  <h1>Chapter 1343 Love Experience Exchange Meeting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was released after being forced by Wang Ying to write his first review on the moon.</p>

    <p>In the wording of the self-review, Ms. Ying'er vividly demonstrated how to write the word "humble"...</p>

    <p>She made a mistake in front of Wang Ying. Does she still have the courage?</p>

    <p>But when I was actually writing the review, I had scolded Wang Ying more than 8,000 times in my heart.</p>

    <p>Every time I write a word, I have to curse ten times.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying didn't know where Ying'er learned these curse words.</p>

    <p>They don't seem to be the same...</p>

    <p>More Zaun than Zaun players.</p>

    <p>In this regard, Wang Ying established the fifth rule: "Don't have random thoughts when writing. Otherwise, you may increase the number of words in your composition."</p>

    <p>"Absolutely!" Sun Ying'er knew she couldn't resist.</p>

    <p>He had no choice but to stretch out his fingers, pull his eyelids, and stick out his tongue.</p>

    <p>Use this behavior to declare your dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>Just like a childish ghost.</p>

    <p>So that night, Wang Ying gave Sun Ying'er a new nickname: Ying Sansui.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When being released by Wang Ying, Sun Ying'er discovered that Sun Rong was video chatting with Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>Both girls were blushing slightly and seemed to be discussing something animatedly.</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about?" Sun Ying'er quickly came over and turned into a shadow and stuck to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There are often people moving around in the hospital. Boss Sun is right next door.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was worried that his humanoid form might be discovered by others, so he made this decision.</p>

    <p>Compared to the human form, the shadow form is safer.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Sun Rong didn't look surprised at all when he heard his voice. Sun Ying'er knew immediately. Sun Rong had remembered his existence!</p>

    <p>Hey-hey!</p>

    <p>She is indeed the woman of my family!</p>

    <p>As expected of Rongrong!</p>

    <p>"Have you finished writing Miss Ying'er's review? Her attitude is very sincere. We all read it." Opposite the video, Liu Qingyi couldn't help but smile when she saw Sun Ying'er's return.</p>

    <p>When he thought that his self-examination was "publicly executed", Sun Ying'er's shadow turned red: "He... he went too far! Why do you show everything to others! This Wang Ying! I will definitely do it in the future I want him to look good!"</p>

    <p>"Haha. Don't be angry, Miss Ying'er. It's actually nothing. Master of Shadows is trying to spur you on."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi said with a smile: "If you practice in the void world for a hundred years, you probably won't get as much benefit as staying on Earth for a year. Following Ling Zhenren is beneficial. If you really hate Wang Ying, you should stay on Earth."</p>

    <p>"Is that so..." Sun Ying'er was doubtful.</p>

    <p>"And in essence, your abilities all start with Shadow, which is Ling Zhenren's sister's original ability. If you want to defeat Wang Ying, you have to please Ling Zhenren's sister." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>"Yes! I understand!" Sun Ying'er nodded.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Liu Qingyi pointed out a new idea to her!</p>

    <p>She asked why she couldn't use her Shadow ability in front of Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it was Ling Zhenren's sister who gave the hateful Wang Ying some privileges.</p>

    <p>Huh! What a shameful permission dog!</p>

    <p>Follow the path pointed by Liu Qingyi. Then as long as you please Ling Zhenren's sister in the future and obtain the same privileged abilities as Wang Ying, then you no longer need to be afraid of Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>At least. You can get rid of Wang Ying's tracking.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Ying'er feels that his hatred for Wang Ying has almost reached the critical point.</p>

    <p>The claw marks left by Wang Ying on her wrist were like the golden hoop on Sun Wukong's head. Sun Ying'er wanted to take it off all the time.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. What are you talking about? I see it's a lively conversation."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>She wanted to join in the conversation between the two women.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing... just some..." Sun Rong's face was hot. When he spoke, he became a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi quickly added: "Nothing. Just some experience in love."</p>

    <p>"Love experience? But here we are all single!" Sun Ying'er found it a bit funny.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid you two haven't really been in love yet. I have a lot of experience." Liu Qingyi slapped the table and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>She is indeed single now.</p>

    <p>But above the divine realm, when she was still the aloof eldest lady of the Liu family, she had so many suitors!</p>

    <p>And among so many suitors, it is inevitable that there are many ex-boyfriends.</p>

    <p>And this is what Liu Qingyi calls "experience."</p>

    <p>"Seems interesting!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said: "What kind of experience do you have? For example, the experience of tongue kissing and drawing?"</p>

    <p>"Ying'er!"</p>

    <p>Sun RongWhen I thought of this scene, steam started to come out of my head again.</p>

    <p>God knows why as his own shadow. Sun Ying'er is so bold!</p>

    <p>This makes Sun Rong a little confused...</p>

    <p>However.</p>

    <p>The shadow of classmate Wang Ling is Wang Ying. It seems that his personality is opposite to that of classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He is a very domineering type...</p>

    <p>When I thought about it, Sun Rong suddenly felt much better.</p>

    <p>Because it seems that she is not the only one who is troubled.</p>

    <p>"Ahem..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi cleared her throat: "Falling in love is a process that every girl or boy will go through. Although I have experience, it is only limited to emotional issues. Other conveniences. I don't know. You need to go it alone. explore."</p>

    <p>"Explore on your own? Can you be more specific?"Sun Rong felt that Liu Qingyi's words were very vague.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi held her forehead. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry: "You can only explore this by yourself. Do you still want me and Miss Sun to simulate tongue kissing and drawing?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>"But when it comes to this, I have to kindly remind you!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi put on the posture of an old lady and said: "No matter you are a girl or a boy, love is love. But you must learn to cherish and love yourself! This point. Miss Sun is so smart. I think it should be easy to understand."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I know." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then, if you have any other questions, you can ask me." Liu Qingyi said with a smile in the video.</p>

    <p>"I have!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er volunteered: "How many boyfriends does Miss Liu have?"</p>

    <p>"I can't remember clearly. It's probably a lot." Liu Qingyi said.</p>

    <p>She didn't shy away from it, but she really couldn't remember clearly.</p>

    <p>But even with so many ex-boyfriends, Liu Qingyi still fully achieved the point of "self-cherishing and self-love."</p>

    <p>Among the numerous ex-boyfriends, Liu Qingyi remembers that she only kissed one "ex-boyfriend."</p>

    <p>There are many more. I can't even hold hands.</p>

    <p>Now these memories were brought back by Sun Ying'er's words, which made Liu Qingyi feel nostalgic.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was about to open his mouth to ask a question when he heard Sun Ying'er ask another question, "How many times did that Miss Liu get laid!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong made a "pop" sound. A mouthful of water sprayed onto the screen.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi categorically said: "Not even once!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Wow! Then you are not a thousand-year-old spinster!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi's mouth twitched: "..."</p>

    <p>She finally knew why Wang Ying couldn't help but bully Sun Ying'er...</p>
