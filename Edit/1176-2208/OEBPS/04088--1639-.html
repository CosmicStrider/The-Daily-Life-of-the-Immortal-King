  <h1>Chapter 1639: Not being the King of the Sea for many years</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under the dual impact of vision and spirit, there will be a certain probability of a "soul short circuit" phenomenon. The famous underground scientist stopped thinking and no longer struggled, which was conducive to the smooth execution of the capture plan.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling feels that things are not that simple.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand and carefully used the {Great Disintegration Technique} to disintegrate the Fire Phoenix Mecha in front of him from the outside bit by bit, so that Liu Renfeng's body hidden inside was exposed.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling applied a temporary adaptive golden light to Liu Renfeng so that Liu Renfeng's body could withstand all the pressure brought by the cosmic environment.</p>

    <p>Her strength is quite impressive. She has the Itinerant Immortal state. However, she is unable to fight in the universe at this state.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling had never thought of going up and digging out his heart before. But he was afraid that the impact would be too great, so he just wiped out Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Liu Renfeng still maintained the original posture. Sitting there, his eyes wide open. His expression was frozen in a frightened look. The whole person looked like he was petrified.</p>

    <p>Then. Zhuo Yi was directly summoned here by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master!"</p>

    <p>After appearing, the situation in front of him honestly did not surprise Zhuo Yi. He had already expected this ending.</p>

    <p>"I'll leave it to you." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Master.Just leave the aftermath to me." Zhuo Yi clasped his fists and said. This is not the first time he has done this. He is very used to it.</p>

    <p>The only flaw this time is that Zhou Ziyi failed to make a contribution in this battle. Show his face in front of Wang Ling or something.</p>

    <p>He was extremely optimistic about Zhou Ziyi. And he was willing to accept him as a disciple. But Wang Ling refused to let go. Zhuo Yi had nothing to do.</p>

    <p>The man in front of me is no longer the man before...</p>

    <p>In the past, a simple annual card would do the trick. Now, giving annual cards as bribes is unlikely to work.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't show his thoughts in front of Wang Ling. He continued as usual. After bidding Wang Ling farewell respectfully, he stayed to deal with Liu Renfeng's affairs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shared part of the power of King's Eyes with Zhuo Yi. First, it allows Zhuo Yi to freely use the ability of King's Eyes to travel freely in various spaces. Secondly, it also enhances Zhuo Yi part of the combat power.</p>

    <p>Of course. Basically, it is better to let Zhuo Yi deal with his aftermath...</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng saw the face of Wang Ling. So this part of the memory must be tampered with. And things in the core world must also be changed... This is beyond the realm of the earth plane. Level combat power. It would be very strange if Liu Renfeng wakes up and dumps them all.</p>

    <p>So, in the infinite secret realm, he revised almost all the memory of Liu Renfeng's battle just now. He breathed a sigh of relief after confirming that nothing was missed.</p>

    <p>If Liu Renfeng wakes up now, the person who fought her before will no longer be Wang Ling. But Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Now, there should be no problem." Zhuo Yi wiped his sweat. This was not the first time he had done this, but he was still a little nervous.</p>

    <p>If the memory tampering thing is not done well, it will lead to insanity. The Huaxiu Alliance ordered Liu Renfeng to be captured alive. I think there is still a place where Liu Renfeng can be used.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception Command Center.</p>

    <p>From the moment Liu Renfeng's real body entered the infinite secret realm, the alliance forces responsible for encircling and suppressing the base finally blew the clarion call to attack.</p>

    <p>These base members of the Fengchu underground laboratory and the artificial humans of Liu Renfeng were all dumbfounded. These cultivators had clearly absorbed their spiritual power by the formation just now. But at this moment, they were all alive and kicking. He got up from the ground and immediately declared an attack!</p>

    <p>"Fuck! So that was an act just now!" Each member of the underground base looked in disbelief. Liu Renfeng's real body has been controlled. The command post fell into a leaderless state.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, the entire underground laboratory extending in all directions was in chaos.</p>

    <p>The large-scale alliance army surrounded the underground laboratory in an orderly manner under Keorn's wise deployment.</p>

    <p>The capture operation lasted for several hours.</p>

    <p>Finally, he breathed a sigh of relief and collapsed with a tired look on his face: "It's finally over..."</p>

    <p>"No. Actually there is only one last step left." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>"The last step?"</p>

    <p>"With Liu Renfeng's strength alone, he shouldn't have the guts to take such a desperate move." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>"What Mr. Dao means is that there are other forces behind this?"</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh." Crispy Noodles nodded. He couldn't really talk to Keorn about much of anything. He had to stop there: "But you don't have to worry. You've done a great job commanding this operation. Leave the rest of the work to Li Xian and Zhang Zhui."</p>

    <p>"Are they the new Elders?" Keorn's eyes lit up. He'd heard of them. Because they suddenly joined the Office of Strategic Deception and became Elders right away. Many people wondered where they came from.</p>

    <p>In addition, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui joined the Office of Strategic Deception. Lord Diulei gave them the position of Guest Elder... It's equivalent to some honorary professors in the Cultivation University. Listen to the Office of Strategic Deception. In reality, it's just a title.</p>

    <p>But this name actually reflects the net worth directly.</p>

    <p>Because Li Xian and Zhang Zhui are currently the only two nominal elders in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Their names have been famous in ancient times, but they are not well known in the modern world of cultivation. Now they have suddenly become honorary elders. Many speculations have undoubtedly deepened the mystery of the two people.</p>

    <p>Just as Keorn and Crispy Noodles' command work came to an end, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were also looking for traces of the people behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Following the clue of "the magic circle that illuminates all things and their vitality," the two people found some clues based on the layout and techniques of the magic circle.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled slightly: "Interesting. Judging from the technique, it does look like the handiwork of Master Wu Xin. If it were him, he would indeed be able to activate the kind of magic that can affect thousands of people."</p>

    <p>"But he has clearly been imprisoned in the picture. Now he can only be a pile of bones." Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui shook his head: "Brother Xian, what you said is too absolute. Dao Ancestor Wang is indeed terrifyingly powerful. But there are no less than tens of thousands of people locked up in the Corpse Map. Tens of thousands of ancient experts. Can you guarantee this? The old thief will not capsize in the gutter? It is the same as the idol stars who have just debuted recently and it was revealed that their parents are old bastards. There are no absolutes in everything."</p>

    <p>"He deceived Dao Ancestor Wang. He is indeed a talent." Li Xian sighed.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "There is one more thing that convinced me that he was behind all these things."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Remember, when Ling Zhenren and Fenmu Shen first fought, those ancient divine weapons that Fenmu Shen summoned."</p>

    <p>Li Xian nodded: "Of course I remember...it was the legion created by Fenmu Shen. As a result, Dao Ancestor's Dharma Creatures captured it. Now only a few hundred of the tens of millions of troops are left."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "When Ling Zhenren synchronized the battle scenes in the core world just now, I saw the Liu Renfeng fire phoenix mecha. I just felt that it was similar to the ancient magic weapon."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Xian was shocked: "The ancient magic weapon. It was originally built by Master Wu Xin?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "He was originally a famous mechanic in the Vanguard period. Because all the parts of his body are replaceable. The heart he uses is also a mechanical heart. That's why he got the name 'Wu Xin'."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "But how do you know so much..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "His wife told me."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "Brother Zi Xiang. Shouldn't you..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Let the past be over. I have not been the King of the Sea for many years now."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>
