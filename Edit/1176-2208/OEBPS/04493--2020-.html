  <h1>Chapter 2020 The founder of the Sun family and Laojun</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course. The above are just bold inferences made by Wang Ling based on the latest clues obtained so far. He once suspected that the fortune teller was Peng Xiren. Even the monk had a face-to-face meeting with Peng Xiren. Ask him if he knows about this.</p>

    <p>Judging from Peng Xiren's reaction and attitude at that time, it seemed that he didn't want to admit it... but this was exactly Peng Xiren's deception. If he had admitted it directly and clearly, he would have doubted the authenticity.</p>

    <p>If you think about it carefully, Peng Xiren himself has never taken the initiative to admit this.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling more suspicious that Peng Xiren is the fortune teller.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that since Peng Xiren was defeated by him last time, he seems to have become a lot more "behaved." However, this kind of person's character is naturally restless.</p>

    <p>"So the purpose of classmate Wang Ling and Senior Toya wanting to enter the ancestral land is to... verify whether the ancestor of our Sun family is still in the ancestral land?" Sun Rong asked at this moment.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Immortal Toya nodded and said, "But if even Miss Sun doesn't know about it, then there's nothing we can do. Ling Zhenren originally wanted to entrust me with this matter, and then he did it to me in secret. Protection. He was worried that if he went there in person, he might alert others. If you really want to talk about it, I actually have some connections with the founder of the Sun family."</p>

    <p>"Origin?"</p>

    <p>"I attended the Sun family's ancestor worship ceremony five hundred years ago as a friend." Immortal Toya said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Senior...know the ancestor of our Sun family?" Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>She also knew about the ancestor worship ceremony. It was held every five hundred years. However, the location of the ancestor worship was not in the Sun family's ancestral land. Instead, Feng Shui calculations found the best location to place the altar near the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>In other words, the actual location of the ancestor worship ceremony is actually very close to the Sun family's ancestral land. The radius distance does not exceed 1,000 kilometers...</p>

    <p>This range may sound a bit far away, but the world of cultivation is vast. It is common for cultivators flying with swords to reach speeds exceeding one thousand kilometers per hour in areas with no speed limit. So for cultivators, it really doesn't count. too far.</p>

    <p>However, it is not easy to find a secret altar within this range.</p>

    <p>In addition to hiding its location, the ancestral land of the family will also be encrypted based on the terrain. With the ability of the ancestor of the Sun family, many warning traps and illusion traps may be placed near the ancestral land. Only the head of the Sun family knows how to safely enter the ancestral land. local method.</p>

    <p>Of course, if Wang Ling wants, he can force it to find it. But the damage to the Sun family's ancestral land will be irreversible...</p>

    <p>In addition, Wang Ling can also forcibly retrieve the memory of Boss Sun to know the location of Dao Ancestor. However, that is also risky.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is a good man. I gave him many limited edition crispy noodles as gifts before. Wang Ling is certainly not an ungrateful person.</p>

    <p>Although he never believed that destroying the ancestral land would destroy the lifeline of the entire family, the beliefs of others should still be respected.</p>

    <p>Let's get back to the subject. Let's talk about the ancestor worship ceremony itself.</p>

    <p>Those who are qualified to participate in the ancestor worship ceremony. In addition to the direct blood relatives of the Sun family, the rest are friends in the cultivation world who have close relations with the Sun family. Among them are many famous and powerful people. Descendants of those close friends the founder of the Sun family made.</p>

    <p>However, the participation of outsiders from the Sun family has been limited over the years. That is to say, there is a limit on the number of people. Those who can participate must be those who have the closest relationship with the Sun family at this stage.</p>

    <p>This is the first time Sun Rong heard Immortal Toya talk about how he participated in the ancestor worship ceremony as a friend five hundred years ago. So he was very surprised.</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya took out a golden gourd pendant from his arms.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Sun Rong saw the pendant. His eyes flickered. There was a bit of shock in it.</p>

    <p>"As Miss Sun sees it, this is the property of my ancestor, Lao Jun. It was also passed down to me by my master. Once the candidate for the true disciple is confirmed.</p>

    <p>Then he would pass this thing on. "That's it." When I saw this gourd pendant, Sun Rong understood everything at once.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has some questions: "Who is Laojun?"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling doesn't know something. Laojun is an ancient senior who lived at the same time as the ancestor of my Sun family. His strength is unfathomable. Although it is rumored that he died while traveling in the universe, he may still be alive. uncertain."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling's mouth twitched slightly.</p>

    <p>Another space tour...</p>

    <p>He immediately thought of the immortal people from Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered. It seems that those powerful people always have the idea of leaving the earth to go to extraterrestrial places. And then if something unexpected happens, they will never come back...</p>

    <p>But this is actually not difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>After all, I have the idea of going out to the universe. In essence, I still want to understand a higher realm. When the earth is no longer invincible, I want to feel the vastness of the universe. In fact, it is indeed helpful to enlightenment.</p>

    <p>"I heard from my grandpa that the ancestor secretly ate a lot of elixirs from senior Lao Jun. Then the two got to know each other like that. Not only did Lao Jun not blame the ancestor, but the two of them became very good friends."</p>

    <p>"That's okay..." Wang Ying couldn't help complaining in Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>"Because Senior Laojun's elixir is said to be very unpalatable. It is astringent and bitter. But I don't know why our ancestor can eat it with gusto like jelly beans."</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong doesn't know too much about the past. It's just a rough idea. She said: "So under such friendship, the first ancestor fought like this. A pendant. And gave it to Laojun as a witness of friendship. In the ancestral precepts of our Sun family, there is also a record of the pendant. Anyone who owns this pendant is a friend of my Sun family, and will always be eligible to participate in the Sun family sacrifices. Ancestor Ceremony."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling's thoughts were like seeing the sun through the clouds. He suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be a friendship recorded in group training. Then this relationship is indeed extraordinary...</p>

    <p>The reason why he asked Immortal Toya to do this was because he just casually asked about the situation. Unexpectedly, Immortal Toya immediately came forward and took the initiative to find him, saying that he might have a way to enter the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling never thought that there is such an ancient friendship between the master of Immortal Toya and the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Now it seems that this confidence is indeed well-founded.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly thought of a way: "Should we try to go to the place where the ancestor worship ceremony was held five hundred years ago? Although the scope is quite large, there may not be any results. But after all, I He is also a descendant of the Sun family. Maybe he can use his sixth sense to detect the idea of the ancestor's layout of the ancestral land."</p>

    <p>"Is this okay, Miss Sun?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"It's just a casual stroll. I didn't say that I would definitely find the ancestral land."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong laughed: "If this is discovered by accident, it can only be regarded as an accidental entry. In life, no one has ever had an accident happen... I remember hearing my grandfather mention it. There were people in the past. I accidentally entered the Sun family's ancestral land and almost died there. It was my grandfather who took him out."</p>

    <p>"There are other things like this. Isn't there any problem? What if the secret of the ancestral land is revealed..."</p>

    <p>"No. Later that person became my grandma."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
