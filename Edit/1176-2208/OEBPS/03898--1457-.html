  <h1>Chapter 1457 I understand</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The tour plan for Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street was originally scheduled for two days. We would go together on Saturday and Sunday, so we would have relatively plenty of time.</p>

    <p>Because there are many things to do in the ancient street, one day is actually not enough. Anyway, the hotels in the ancient street are also properties of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Check-in is free.</p>

    <p>It's okay for one person to have a presidential suite.</p>

    <p>But the girl considered that after all, she had made an appointment with Wang Ling before. She didn't say whether it was for one day or two days.</p>

    <p>If you just make the decision like that...it might be a bit...not good.</p>

    <p>So, although she made a two-day plan, she actually focused on the key activities on the first day.</p>

    <p>A room named: [Gujie Action Assist Team] chat group.</p>

    <p>Several people are having a group video call.</p>

    <p>"So, that's the basic situation. Do you have any other questions? If there's anything you don't understand, you can ask." Sun Rong looked at Li Youyue, Guo Hao, and Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Guo Hao raised his hand.</p>

    <p>"Say." Sun Rong looked at her.</p>

    <p>"The boss has obviously made a plan for two days. So do you want us to perform it then and force you to stay in the ancient street for one night so that you and Wang Ling can stay in the hotel together?"</p>

    <p>"No way I'm thinking that way..."</p>

    <p>The girl argued. Then she quickly slapped her hot face: "This is too deliberate! And...classmate Wang Ling he..."</p>

    <p>The words were on the tip of his tongue. Sun Rong was unable to speak in the end.</p>

    <p>She wanted to say that Wang Ling could read minds. With your poor acting skills, how could you hide it from Wang Ling's eyes?</p>

    <p>But this matter is actually strictly confidential.</p>

    <p>In their chat group, they are the only ones who know the truth.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl who realized that she had almost spilled the beans felt extremely regretful.</p>

    <p>It seems that she will have to be more careful in the future. She cannot get into trouble just because she heard some embarrassing words. Follow the words.</p>

    <p>At this time, seeing the girl on the screen blushing and falling into silence, Guo Hao was confused: "Wang Ling? What's wrong with Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "You don't want to say that. Wang Ling can tell that we are acting, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "I don't think you need to worry about your acting skills, Boss Sun. Uncle Guo's family has a movie studio. I've been there before. During the summer vacation. Guo and I used to go there to act from time to time. Our acting skills have long been honed."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "No...it's too risky..."</p>

    <p>"So as long as you can't tell it's fake, that's all. Then I understand." Guo Hao chuckled, showing a mysterious expression.</p>

    <p>"You understand again..."</p>

    <p>"Yes! I understand! Also, does Boss Sun have any designated hotels?"</p>

    <p>"I told you I didn't book a hotel. My classmate Wang Ling probably won't want to stay there for one more day!"</p>

    <p>"You don't need a hotel? That's not open-air. Boss, is it so exciting for the first time? I understand..."</p>

    <p>"No! You don't understand!"</p>

    <p>"No. Boss. I understand. Everyone understands."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiang Yingying came to the hotel where he went before.</p>

    <p>This time Jiang Xiaoche arrived early in the morning. She ordered a table of various dishes and was waiting for her.</p>

    <p>She didn't have time to go back home. She came over right after class in her school uniform. When Jiang Xiaoche saw Jiang Yingying, she smiled slightly and said in an unusually gentle voice: "You must be hungry. Eat quickly."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Brother Ah Che..." Jiang Yingying nodded slightly. Then he took off his school uniform and hung it aside.</p>

    <p>Underneath the girl is a pure white short-sleeved shirt. The short-sleeved shirt has a 60 High School logo on the chest. However, this logo looks slightly deformed under the influence of internal forces...</p>

    <p>From the beginning, Jiang Xiaoche noticed that Jiang Yingying was somewhat similar to Sun Rong. But now that he saw the girl's figure, he immediately noticed the difference between the two.</p>

    <p>This is developing so well...</p>

    <p>If the development of Sun Rong is like a newly made jungle knife, then Jiang Yingying. seems to be a three-piece set.</p>

    <p>Although there is still a certain gap between the Liushen costume, but at this age, it has reached a very excellent level.</p>

    <p>But Jiang Xiaoche didn't dare to look more. He just took a sneak peek. He was afraid that his eyes would be noticed by the girl, which would leave a vulgar impression.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying took a bite of lettuce and chewed it a few times. The expression on his face didn't seem very happy.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong? It's your first day of school. Did something unhappy happen to you?" Jiang Xiaoche looked at Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"I feel like they are all bullying me..." Jiang Yingying's eyes filled with tears as she recounted all the things about the privileged seats.</p>

    <p>"Stop crying."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche took out the handkerchief from his pocket and handed it over.</p>

    <p>The girl took it, wiping her nose and tears: "Ah, brother, is there anything you can do? Let me sit next to classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"It's a bit difficult... mainly because I'm not familiar with this school." Jiang Xiaoche was filled with shame.</p>

    <p>He knew just from Jiang Yingying's description that this was the operation of the eldest lady in their family...</p>

    <p>The eldest lady is in charge. How dare he intervene?</p>

    <p>"Is that possible..." Jiang Yingying looked at Jiang Xiaoche expectantly.</p>

    <p>"I know what you mean. You mean, you want me to lend you money, right?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche smiled and said: "Yes. But the condition is that you have to be my real girlfriend."</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying didn't expect Jiang Xiaoche to say that. Her face immediately turned hot: "Then forget it..."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiang Xiaoche wanted to cry but had no tears.</p>

    <p>He really has no charm at all?</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche thought for a while and decided to find another way: "Or. Let's make a bet. For example, if you like that Wang Ling. You can first confirm whether he likes you too."</p>

    <p>"How...how do I confirm this?"</p>

    <p>"That's your business. I can help you buy a seat. The deadline is the last final exam of your senior year of high school. If you can impress Wang Ling, I will bless you. But if you can't move him. You You have to be my wife. This is a bet."</p>

    <p>He looked at Jiang Yingying and felt that the conditions he proposed were quite generous.</p>

    <p>However, even with such a condition, the girl still refused: "No...absolutely not...becoming a wife or something like that is too outrageous. And even if I agree, my grandfather may not agree..."</p>

    <p>"I can communicate with your grandfather."</p>

    <p>"Impossible. If my grandfather knew that I spend my energy on boys, he would be angry."</p>

    <p>"He's going to hit you?"</p>

    <p>"No...Grandpa has always been very good to me. He is just a stubborn person. Moreover, Grandpa has always been thrifty. Bribery and the like are of no use to him."</p>

    <p>"So who is your grandfather?" Jiang Xiaoche frowned.</p>

    <p>In fact, he never had time to investigate Jiang Yingying's family relationship.</p>

    <p>"He is Martial Saint." At this time, Jiang Yingying raised his head and said.</p>

    <p>"Is this your grandfather's title? I also like Guan Erye from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This is the god of wealth and wealth."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying shook her head hurriedly: "No, Brother Ah Che. My grandfather is the real Martial Saint..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "Do you know. Marshal Jiang among the Ten Generals?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>
