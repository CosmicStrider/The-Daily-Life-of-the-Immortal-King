  <h1>Chapter 1235 The security guard at the door is a bit scary</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The central lakeside of the Office of Strategic Deception. This is a place specially built for disciples who specialize in water law.</p>

    <p>A pavilion extends along the elegant curved promenade on the shore to the center of the lake, dividing the entire lake.</p>

    <p>Under the baptism of the moonlight, there is a kind of beauty of yin and yang cutting off the dusk.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan entered through the mountain gate all the way. After asking for instructions from the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception, he was led here.</p>

    <p>This time he came out and was ready to fight. But unexpectedly, the Office of Strategic Deception treated him in an unusually...gentle way?</p>

    <p>On the way here, Sun Yiyuan just got the news. It was said that it was the scavenger who came to the house in the last wave.</p>

    <p>One captain has died.</p>

    <p>No one saw how he died. According to intelligence data, he was actually killed by a security guard.</p>

    <p>When he first got the news, Sun Yiyuan thought there was something wrong.</p>

    <p>As a result, when he just passed by the mountain gate, he saw a young man who looked somewhat similar to Wang Ling, but was fundamentally different, smiling at him.</p>

    <p>Although it was very similar to Wang Ling, he knew very well that it was not Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There is a fundamental difference in the aura on his body. And according to his long-term observation of Wang Ling, Wang Ling is a person who is not very good at smiling.</p>

    <p>But the young man in front of the mountain gate looked at him and smiled.</p>

    <p>His laughter sent chills down his spine. He had a creepy feeling.</p>

    <p>If I were to fight against that boy just now, what would be my chances of winning?</p>

    <p>On the way to the Central Lake, Sun Yiyuan had been thinking about this issue.</p>

    <p>The combat power of the Office of Strategic Deception is too terrifying.</p>

    <p>Even the "security guard" at the door is a "sweeping monk" level existence.</p>

    <p>No wonder the Office of Strategic Deception quickly established itself as the number one sect in the Huaxiu Kingdom in less than a few months after its establishment.</p>

    <p>If it continues to develop like this, the Office of Strategic Deception can easily take over the world's number one position.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan waited in the pavilion for a while.</p>

    <p>Not long after, footsteps were heard on the corridor. Facing the pale and bright moonlight, he could clearly see the face of the person coming.</p>

    <p>It was a somewhat ugly-looking young man. Sun Yiyuan didn't recognize who he was at first.</p>

    <p>Until the young man said: "Mr. Sun came to my Office of Strategic Deception. I am really lucky to be in my Office of Strategic Deception! I wish you immortality and good luck, sir!"</p>

    <p>This familiar voice instantly evoked Sun Yiyuan's thoughts. He immediately narrowed his eyes: "You are..."</p>

    <p>"I am Zhuo Yi." After pinching his face, Zhuo Yi revealed his true identity without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>"As expected, you were not captured." Sun Yiyuan smiled.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Sun has expected this?"</p>

    <p>"I can probably guess that you have escaped. I just don't know your whereabouts."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun clasped his hands behind his back and floated gently as he left the pavilion.</p>

    <p>His body is as light as duckweed. He stands on tiptoe above the lake.</p>

    <p>There were only a few ripples and a few circles of ripples.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi followed the movements of Mr. Boss Sun. They also stood on the lake. The two looked at each other deeply under the soft moonlight.</p>

    <p>"You are the person that Da Kang likes. You are also the person who is most likely to succeed him as the leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance in the future."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan said: "I was still doubtful about his choice. But now it seems that you do have some abilities."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is ridiculous. It's just that Xiao Zhuozi is lucky." Zhuo Yi clasped his fists.</p>

    <p>He saw that Sun Yiyuan had changed into a set of light sportswear.</p>

    <p>Then he roughly guessed the old man's purpose of going up the mountain this time.</p>

    <p>"Is Mr. Sun planning to use violence to beg people this time?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan's lips twitched when he heard these words.</p>

    <p>The chairman of the dignified Huaguo Shuilian Group came to visit in person... He really came with the intention of fighting.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. You are too polite!</p>

    <p>How could he take action...</p>

    <p>He even took out the ancestral magic weapon "Gold and Jade Shocking Stick" from the Sun family's treasury!</p>

    <p>"How about I guess the purpose of Mr. Sun's trip?"</p>

    <p>Seeing that Sun Yiyuan remained silent, Zhuo Yi began to conduct his own analysis: "Mr. Sun did intend to fight with us at first."</p>

    <p>"But after entering the gate of our Office of Strategic Deception, Mr. Sun found that we were not hostile. Therefore, the general purpose of Mr. Sun's trip may be to test the authenticity of my Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"You see clearly..."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun chuckled.</p>

    <p>Of course, the reason why he chose not to take action was not entirely because he found that the Office of Strategic Deception was not hostile to him.</p>

    <p>But he realized that even if he did it, he might not be able to beat the security guard at the door.</p>

    <p>He was a True Immortal. He was frightened by the aura of a "security guard."</p>

    <p>If you really can't defeat him then, wouldn't you become the laughing stock of the world?</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that if this matter comes out, the share price of Huaguo Shuilian Group will plummet!</p>

    <p>As a businessman, in order to preserve his integrity, Sun Yiyuan thought it over again and felt that it would be inappropriate to take action directly.</p>

    <p>And True Immortal is fighting. If the movement is too big, it will be enough to destroy the city...</p>

    <p>"Regarding the interrogation of Keorn. We have backed up the video data."</p>

    <p>On the lake. Zhuo Yi said frankly: "If Mr. Sun wants to see it, I can take Mr. Sun there now."</p>

    <p>"You are sincere."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan looked at Zhuo Yi: "You're not worried. I'm not from your side?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled: "A consortium. No matter how bold it is, it is impossible to go against the General Alliance. Unless Mr. Sun has been instructed by someone..."</p>

    <p>This point. Zhuo Yi was on the Wuling Hongguang van. I heard someone from Zhenyuan Immortal analyze that someone on the road smelled of medicine.</p>

    <p>So if we continue to think about it, it will be obvious whose order the Huaguo Shuilian Group is subject to.</p>

    <p>"Since the establishment of General Alliance, General Alliance belongs to that Lord. Our Office of Strategic Deception relies on General Alliance to grow. Naturally, we will stand by that Lord unconditionally."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi bowed again: "Mr. Sun, does he know why I invited him here?"</p>

    <p>With the evening breeze blowing, Sun Yiyuan's eyes looked at the bright moon reflected on the lake in front of him with great tranquility.</p>

    <p>"My heart is like the bright moon."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun stared at the moon. His tense heart relaxed a little.</p>

    <p>He was sighing in his mind. Fortunately, the Office of Strategic Deception is not the enemy... and is not on the other side.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the outcome would be really hard to predict.</p>

    <p>Just sending out the security guards at the door can kill people crazy.</p>

    <p>"We will share the next information with Mr. Sun. If Mr. Sun trusts us, we can also share some of the information we know." Zhuo Yi said this. The phone in his suit trouser pocket vibrated.</p>

    <p>It's the Immortal people from Zhenyuan who are back.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi learned that the sample of the red decoction was intact.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the location where Keorn is stored is also very tricky.</p>

    <p>He actually put this book into the toilet...</p>

    <p>When Zhenyuan Immortals went there, the place where Keorn lived was in a mess. It had obviously been searched by scavengers.</p>

    <p>But they never expected that Keorn's action of placing the sample in the toilet would invisibly protect the sample.</p>

    <p>Because just before these scavengers opened the toilet.</p>

    <p>In this way, the book has been teleported away by Lord Ma first.</p>

    <p>Now that Zhenyuan Immortal has passed away again, Lord Ma has sent the sample back again...</p>
