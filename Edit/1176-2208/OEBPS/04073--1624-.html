  <h1>Chapter 1624 Mistaken Identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling heard that Jiang Yingying was sent to the hospital, his face was blue and his hair was messy.</p>

    <p>She was still wearing pajamas and was twitching constantly as if she was possessed by an evil spirit.</p>

    <p>As the initiators of this incident, Jiugong Liangzi, Li Xian, and Zhang Zhui also feel guilty for what is happening now.</p>

    <p>Who knew this little girl would have the courage to move out and live alone. But she is so timid.</p>

    <p>That night, after Jiang Yingying was sent to the hospital.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also received a text message from Sun Rong soon.</p>

    <p>There are not many characters in the text message. You can understand it at a glance.</p>

    <p>This is Sun Rong blaming himself.</p>

    <p>Because Jiugong Liangzi was sent by her. She didn't expect things to turn out like this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this text message. He typed a few words, then deleted the words again. In the end, nothing was sent.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know why Sun Rong has changed a lot in recent times. He is cautious about everything he does. And no matter what he does, he seems to think from his perspective.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, this is just a trivial matter.</p>

    <p>The main thing to blame is the Thousand-Faced Man who is planning everything behind the scenes. It has nothing to do with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying only has some similarities with Sun Rong. But in fact, as long as he knows two people at the same time, Wang Ling feels that the difference between the two is really big.</p>

    <p>Impatience and quietness, stubbornness and flexibility, childishness and maturity...</p>

    <p>A series of words instantly came to mind to describe the intuitive feelings the two people brought to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, an open area located in the northern suburbs of Songhai City. Accompanied by the roaring mechanical sound, a glass elevator leading directly to the underground laboratory suddenly emerged from the platforms spread out on both sides.</p>

    <p>Several men in black suits and sunglasses entered the elevator together with an old woman with fluffy hair. She had gray hair. She had heavy crow's feet at the corners of her eyes but her complexion was very good. She looked like a rather elegant grandma.</p>

    <p>After entering the glass elevator, the old woman squinted her eyes and asked, "Shou Chong, are you still resisting?"</p>

    <p>"Now he wants to open the infinite door. But we unexpectedly got there first. Now he is still some distance away from the last step. And we are still a little bit close to success. He never thought that we could enter through the back door of the secret realm."</p>

    <p>"If he had such a brain, Master Tianji wouldn't have expelled him from the school back then." The old woman said with a smile.</p>

    <p>After the glass elevator dropped vertically to a certain coordinate position, it was transferred to the encrypted channel.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality of this underground laboratory in the northern suburbs, there is a huge maze encrypted area above the laboratory. The maze will change every day. Only by entering the correct password will the glass elevator enter the maze exit and reach the underground smoothly.</p>

    <p>This underground maze is also a proud work of the old woman's personal design.</p>

    <p>Her name. Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>Road number: Mrs. Fengchu.</p>

    <p>But this road number. Liu Renfeng has not been mentioned by anyone for a long, long time.</p>

    <p>After the sudden change in the Tianjimen cabinet, she has occupied the core technology of Tianjimen to this day. She has re-operated Tianji into an underground scientific force. She specializes in developing black technology magic weapons for plutocrats and wealthy people around the world.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of Liu Renfeng, Shou Chong wants to challenge Tianji on his own. After all, it is just a fly shaking a tree.</p>

    <p>Exit of the underground laboratory. Liu Renfeng paced, hands behind his back, and stepped out of the elevator.</p>

    <p>Before taking two steps, the personnel from the Intelligence Department hurried over: "Madam, the previous plan failed. We did not catch Miss Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>"Who asked you to catch her?" Liu Renfeng's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"This... But the picture that Madam gave us. It's clearly this Sun..."</p>

    <p>The man took out the photo and looked at it carefully. Finally he found some discrepancies. The photo was covered with fine beads of sweat: "Sorry, madam. We made a mistake..."</p>

    <p>"What I want is this girl named Jiang Yingying. No matter what, you have to get her here. I just want her alive. For other things, you can do whatever you like."Liu Renfeng said: "So, has this matter been dealt with?"</p>

    <p>"Now the Sun Rong girl is frightened and is receiving treatment. The captured brother has committed suicide by taking poison. There is no risk of exposure." said the person from the Intelligence Department.</p>

    <p>"Heh. Tell your section chief that if he does it next time, I won't let him go."</p>

    <p>"yes..."</p>

    <p>Critical moment. Liu Renfeng doesn't want this to happen again.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, this matter was handled in a timely and appropriate manner. As long as Jiang Yingying is brought to her side, everything will be stable.</p>

    <p>Compared with Shou Chong's method of summoning hundreds of extremely powerful cultivators to break through the main entrance of the secret realm and forcefully open the main entrance.</p>

    <p>She only needs one Jiang Yingying to do it.</p>

    <p>Although this big plan sounds very scary to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>But Liu Renfeng feels that maybe this is fate.</p>

    <p>As the kid who was chosen that year.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying has such a mission to become the sacrificed chess piece.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong was driving to the hospital where Jiang Yingying was staying. She was full of anxiety and uneasiness. Although she had just sent a message to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But there was no response from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Miss. Don't worry too much. Jiang is fine. The situation is much less serious than that of General Yi's son. Yi Zhiyang's situation is more serious. She's just a little shaken up. As long as she takes the pills we sent , I believe she will recover in a few days." In the car. Jiang Xiaoche said comfortingly.</p>

    <p>He tightened his grip on the steering wheel. In fact, he felt a little nervous inside.</p>

    <p>He knew this little girl... would cause trouble again...</p>

    <p>How long did it take for the incident in this ancient street to subside? And it was so easy to believe what those evil people said. I really thought that I could improve my strength in a short period of time with folk remedies.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche gritted his teeth and sped up and rushed towards the hospital.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared on the empty road ahead, like a ghost.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche thought he was dazzled. When he realized what he was doing, the car had already hit this person.</p>

    <p>The airbag deployed instantly.</p>

    <p>When Jiang Xiaoche removed his face buried in the airbag, he saw a man covered in black mucus and stopped his car with a hand with only three fingers.</p>

    <p>This is the "biochemical coat" developed by Liu Renfeng. It can be worn on the body in the form of smear. It can greatly improve the combat power of the cultivator based on the cultivator's realm.</p>

    <p>"Miss... the situation is not good! Are you injured?" Jiang Xiaoche was shocked. He turned around to look at Sun Rong. He saw Sun Rong sitting in the back seat uninjured. Just now He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"I'm fine. What's going on outside?"</p>

    <p>"There is a man. He is covered in black mucus..."</p>

    <p>"Did you come for me." Sun Rong sighed. With a look of preparedness.</p>

    <p>But in the next second.</p>

    <p>The slime man spoke.</p>

    <p>He stood in front of the car. He sneered and said, "Jiang Yingying, I want to trouble you. Come with us."</p>
