  <h1>Chapter 2136 Wang Ming's major discovery</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the help of Lao Huang and Sun Rong, the future heir of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, helped to assist Wang Ling's development in Fuyun Town is smooth. It is a novice village town rated Ding. Suddenly the level increases. And when it is announced in the game world.</p>

    <p>Almost all players' attention is focused here.</p>

    <p>It's Fuyun Town again...</p>

    <p>Many people looked at the world announcement with doubts in their hearts.</p>

    <p>There are three trigger conditions for the system's world announcement.</p>

    <p>One is to kill a world-class boss. For example, the Hundred Cave Demon Lord level. It is also considered a world-class boss.</p>

    <p>The second is that the city controlled by the player has been upgraded. Generally, an announcement will be made when the city is upgraded for the first time and when it reaches level A.</p>

    <p>The third is to speak freely through the consumption of props.</p>

    <p>In the world of Itinerant Immortal, there is a magic weapon called "Heavenly Dao Hong Bell." By consuming the Heavenly Dao Hong Bell, you can make a free speech within 150 words.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to build a harmonious and civilized world, swearing is not allowed. If swearing is used, the system will automatically change it to a "*" sign.</p>

    <p>However, even if you can shout freely, it is very difficult to obtain the Heavenly Dao Hong Zhong. It is equivalent to the casting materials of a pseudo-world-level artifact. It is impossible for non-experienced players to have the materials to create the Heavenly Dao Hong Zhong.</p>

    <p>A place that can be called a novice village. The demon lords of the surrounding Hundred Cave were directly connected to the pot. Then even the town level was upgraded from the lowest level D to level C. Although there are only lower level C at present, the novice town can develop like this. It's actually quite incredible.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mr. Canghu, who was refining medicine in Yetu, also paid attention to this system message that shocked the world.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, no one will choose to expand their territory directly from the beginning of the second-level novice village. First, the character level is not enough. There is a high probability that they will not be able to directly control the right to speak in the novice village.</p>

    <p>Second, the resources around Novice Village are generally limited. Except for the monsters all over the mountains and plains, they are the most common and primitive basic materials.</p>

    <p>Unlike him, he would hire a convoy to go deep into the forest in order to collect precious orphan souls that could be used to refine medicine. He would always risk being attacked by spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Canghu was very calm. He was not afraid of being attacked by spiritual beasts. He was just afraid that the spiritual beasts would not attack him.</p>

    <p>Because he himself has no combat effectiveness. The hired convoy is also timely. If he can tame one or more spiritual beasts for his own use, he will change his current state.</p>

    <p>At that time, he can take the summoning style player route. This style is considered unpopular in the game world of Itinerant Immortal, because spirit beasts are not so easy to be captured. And all major spirit beasts are gregarious creatures.</p>

    <p>Once you kill one, the hatred level will be superimposed. This will directly lead to the leveling up in the future. Because the hatred level exists, the difficulty will be greatly aggravated.</p>

    <p>Therefore, players who play the summoning style do not actively hunt spiritual beasts. Monsters are the key. But in this case, players who play the summoning style will also lose many direct benefits compared to other players.</p>

    <p>For example, high-level inner elixirs, furs, nails and other things obtained from spiritual beasts and monsters... These things can be used to cast immortal tools. They are used for weapons and defense. Some are even precious materials for refining medicine.</p>

    <p>People are in the wild. There is no special equipment for refining elixirs.</p>

    <p>The collected heavenly materials and earthly treasures need to be refined into finished elixirs to have a higher value. If they are sold directly, some of the freshness of the heavenly materials and earthly treasures and their own spiritual energy will be consumed along the way. This is devalued.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Mr. Canghu's purpose was clear from the beginning. He planned to make alchemy directly in the wild.</p>

    <p>The refining method is relatively primitive.</p>

    <p>That is the legendary... iron pot alchemy method!</p>

    <p>All you need is a pot.</p>

    <p>The team has a pot. Mr. Canghu can borrow it.</p>

    <p>This method of making alchemy is similar to cooking a hot pot. Throw in the natural materials and earthly treasures according to the proportions. The rest is to kill time and patience.</p>

    <p>After refining qualified medicinal powder, roll the medicinal powder into balls and store them.</p>

    <p>This process is tedious and complicated. It is impossible to do without a certain degree of patience.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Canghu is obviously an old man.</p>

    <p>He cut the collected souls into finely chopped cubes and placed them on banana leaves according to the proportions. Wrap each portion and divided it into hundreds of portions.</p>

    <p>These hundreds of portions need to be cooked one by one. The probability of failure is about 90%. But as long as you can make 2 packets, you can make back your money.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu took a deep breath and then decided to proceed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Mr. Canghu is indeed Mr. Canghu. Wang Ming, Shou Chong, and Zhai Yin are monitoring everything from the outside. You can feel this man's strong knowledge reserve through the screen.</p>

    <p>"Refining elixirs directly in the field. It is convenient to obtain materials. Although the failure rate is high, but because of the value of the elixir itself, as long as the elixir is refined, the cost can be recovered. You can also make a lot of money."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was full of admiration: "This Canghu teacher has something. And he probably wants to attract spiritual beasts through the smell of medicine emitted when making alchemy. He is a spiritual beast expert himself. He also has experience in how to tame spiritual beasts. If he can really tame one or two, even if the convoy leaves, he can continue to move forward relying on the spiritual beasts."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>What Zhai Yin said was exactly what Wang Ming had predicted in his mind.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Mr. Canghu, Wang Ling, and Sun Rong are currently developing smoothly in the novice stage.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming still felt that something was slightly wrong.</p>

    <p>Be apart of the Operation Wallbreaker.</p>

    <p>They participated in Operation Wallbreaker in order to break the spiritual wall set up by Mixiu.</p>

    <p>This matter was helped by the miracle of the universe, Tiandaoyun. It seemed that everything was going smoothly and the future was bright.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming just feels a little bit uneasy.</p>

    <p>Is it because the stalemate over the restricted sea area has not yet ended?</p>

    <p>Or is that Qiao Yanyuan too honest and unaware of their actions as a wall breaker?</p>

    <p>With Qiao Yanyuan's strength, is it really possible to hide everything from him?</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "What are you thinking about?"</p>

    <p>Micro expressions of Wang Ming. Zhai Yin is also very sensitive now.</p>

    <p>After obtaining the divine brain, even if Wang Ming was overloaded with thinking, the temperature of his head would not rise any more. This made her lose the fun of frying steak on his forehead... So she began to analyze Wang Ming's various micro-expression.</p>

    <p>Psychology. It was originally a part of the training of special forces.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin feels that most of them can be seen through her own analysis.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised the corners of his lips.</p>

    <p>He felt that his stupid wife was too naive.</p>

    <p>He can even predict the probability of the future through mental deduction. It is easy to control micro-expressions... It's just that he deliberately showed off his flaws. He just wanted to see Zhai Yin's cute reaction.</p>

    <p>"Shou Chong. A possibility suddenly occurred to me."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming looked at Shou Chong who was observing carefully and suddenly said</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "What did Mr. Ming think of again?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned: "I'm thinking. Is there a possibility that we are actually wrapped in the wall of spiritual consciousness."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "?"</p>
