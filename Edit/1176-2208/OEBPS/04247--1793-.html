  <h1>Chapter 1793: Diverting trouble to the east×Destroying friendly forces√</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because of Maiko Assi's sudden attack, the tengu in the entire Wisdom Tree fell into a brief chaos.</p>

    <p>"This lunatic Maiko Assi... is actually planning to attack Chilan..."</p>

    <p>"Doesn't he know that Chilan Club has been instructed by the church? And Levis is the person who accused Sun Rong on behalf of Chilan Club. If he is annihilated... the accusation will be completely unfounded!"</p>

    <p>As the highest-ranking Tengu in the group, Ba Ye, who wore the Eight-Star Jason mask on his head, was also twitching slightly at the moment under the mask.</p>

    <p>He has always remained calm. He rarely gets so angry that he trembles all over. But at this moment, Master Ba has to admit that he is still very angry by Maiko Assi's magical operation.</p>

    <p>"What should we do, Mr. Ba? How should we deal with this matter now?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>Ba Ye took a deep breath and tried hard to adjust his emotions. Then he said slowly: "Although Maiko Assi is an out-and-out bastard, we can't directly conflict with him at the moment."</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, according to common sense, Maiko Assi has nothing to do with this matter. He is the army commander-in-chief of the Cultivation Army. And the army headquarters base is not in Glio City. From this action of Maiko Assi, he just happened to be passing by to help.</p>

    <p>Ba Ye didn't expect that Maiko Assi would intervene in this matter.</p>

    <p>"Although our Tengu also have spies in the army, Maiko Assi is very cunning and has always been wary of dealing with counter-intelligence work. The personnel at the army base are transferred almost every day, making it extremely difficult for our companions to work inside." Mr. Ba said.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is the reason why the Tengu have been unable to do anything against Maiko Assi so far. They have even been able to infiltrate the church. However, they have been unable to do anything against Maiko Assi's army.</p>

    <p>Plus, Maiko Assi is an exception.</p>

    <p>Although the power of the church covers most of the government forces, it does not extend to Maiko Assi. The army of Mixiu Country currently only takes orders from Maiko Assi alone.</p>

    <p>Originally, according to the Tengu's original plan, they wanted Wang Ling and others to drive into the army base branch to provoke Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, stealing the chicken will end up losing the rice. Instead, Maiko Assi will focus on the Chilan Society, which is currently on the side of the church and cooperating with the church.</p>

    <p>Having said that.</p>

    <p>Why did that giant beast turn into the Chilan Society's LOGO after it died?</p>

    <p>This is so unscientific!</p>

    <p>But now the Tengu have no intention of thinking about these problems. The top priority is to solve the matter of Maiko Assi and avoid further expansion of the conflict.</p>

    <p>"There was also my mistake in this matter. I didn't expect that Maiko Assi would directly intervene in this matter. I should have asked the brothers from the church to say hello to Maiko Assi in advance."</p>

    <p>"Master Ba. Then go say hello now..."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid it's too late to go now. Maiko Assi is always confident and arrogant. He never revokes his orders."</p>

    <p>"What should we do?"</p>

    <p>"We can only communicate first... At least, keep Levi's and prevent Maiko Assi from doing anything to him."</p>

    <p>Ba Ye said with a headache: "But this matter is not a bad thing. At least it can be clearly seen. The Office of Strategic Deception did send experts to protect them. Or maybe they were among the high school students on the armed bus. Someone is Wang Piaoliang."</p>

    <p>"High school student? No way..."</p>

    <p>"Maybe she just borrowed her identity as a high school student."</p>

    <p>Ba Ye said: "Otherwise, it is impossible to explain why such a huge beast suddenly appeared in front of the garrison base branch. And after the beast died, the debris turned into the shape of the Chilan Society's logo."</p>

    <p>Having said this, he couldn't help but sigh: "I underestimated the methods of these people. This trick is used to divert misfortune to the east. It is an excellent use. But I want to use this method of alienation to cause internal conflicts among us. It is also It's not that easy..."</p>

    <p>"It's time. It's the turn of the senior Eternal One sent by Emperor Zun to assist us to take action.</p>

    <p>"The first batch. Although there are only five here, it is enough for them to drink a pot. I want to see. This Wang Piaoliang. How do you want to deal with it..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Under the accusation of bad navigation, Wang Ling used the trick of diverting trouble to the east. It successfully established the conflict between Maiko Assi and the Chilan Society.</p>

    <p>If this matter goes smoothly. As long as Levis is killed by Maiko Assi, the accusations against Sun Rong from the Glio City Government will naturally disappear.</p>

    <p>And regarding the death of Levis, the contradiction will not appear on Sun Rong. No one will think that Sun Rong directed Maiko Assi to kill Levis.</p>

    <p>Because everyone knows what kind of person Maiko Assi is.</p>

    <p>What he values most is his reputation. As a legendary general in Mixiu Country, there is no way he would take orders from a consortium lady to kill a mafia boss.</p>

    <p>Of course. Whether things will go as smoothly as expected is still unknown to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Tengu's hands and eyes are very good. It's not difficult to use some means to protect Levi's.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the power of the Tengu has penetrated into the church. If you want to completely resolve this matter, the best way is to split the relationship between the church and the Tengu. Let the church and the Maiko Assi side share the same hatred. Transform the contradictions and unite them. The gun is pointed at the Tengu...</p>

    <p>All they have to do here is watch from the other side and watch these people fight in their own turf.</p>

    <p>They are suspicious of each other and pass on conflicts. This is a living old Western house of cards.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought these things could only be seen in TV series. But in fact, they really exist in reality.</p>

    <p>"You young heroes, where do you want to go now? I will cooperate..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Bad Navigation asked.</p>

    <p>He was already afraid.</p>

    <p>Under the threat of Guo Hao's USB flash drive, he had to make a compromise with Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>In fact, before carrying out this mission, Bad Navigation had not collected information on Number 60 High School. At that time, it had a hunch that these high school students would be difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>Judging from historical observation data.</p>

    <p>Just in this half year.</p>

    <p>The Shadow Stream, the Immortal Mansion, Thuntihan Ha, the Night Puppet... and other evil forces at home and abroad in Huaxiu and abroad have been destroyed under the hands of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>It seems to have no connection with Number 60 High School. But in fact, everything is connected by Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Bad Navigation thought that this operation might not go too smoothly. If everything was not ensured, something would happen.</p>

    <p>As a result, his idea has come true.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, big data analysis is still very useful...</p>

    <p>It's just that the Bad Navigator has not yet analyzed who is the hidden master among these people in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Now, it can only give in, pretend to surrender, collect intelligence secretly, and then send the collected information back to Levi's when the time is right.</p>
