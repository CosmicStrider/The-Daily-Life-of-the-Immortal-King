  <h1>Chapter 1354 Zhuo Yi's identity exposed?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong Connect the laptop to the printer. Print out all the sketches you drew.</p>

    <p>Sketches one after another, of Wang Ling's face from various angles, covered her desk in just a few minutes.</p>

    <p>"I actually drew so many... sketches of my classmate Wang Ling..." The girl blushed and shyly buried her face in the pile of drawing paper.</p>

    <p>Although these are all sketches and portraits of Wang Ling, none of them are complete.</p>

    <p>This is because Sun Rong learned about the "Great Shielding Technique" from Zhuo Yi when he was still in the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>Once the protection mechanism is activated, her sketches will turn into a mosaic.</p>

    <p>So in order to prevent this from happening.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not complete the sketch.</p>

    <p>The classmate Wang Ling who puts ellipses on his face is also very cute!</p>

    <p>The girl flipped through the portraits one after another and saw a few drawings that she had highlighted.</p>

    <p>She remembered!</p>

    <p>This is what I drew on the top of the sky, Palm Cliff!</p>

    <p>In addition to the pictures, there is also a text written by Sun Rong himself: "On this day, I was taken to the earth world a second later by a marmot. But I didn't feel the slightest fear. Because I believe that classmate Wang Ling will definitely come to save me!"</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid..."</p>

    <p>"I'm here..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. The message you left for me in the shadow. These may be two sentences that I will never forget."</p>

    <p>"Then. You broke away from all the shadows and appeared in my world like light..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"What I wrote is too disgusting..." The girl blushed as she read the text on the accompanying picture.</p>

    <p>I simply don't believe that I would write such a thing.</p>

    <p>She couldn't bear to read any more, but her curiosity kept driving her to read the information left behind.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior... actually called me Senior Wife..."</p>

    <p>That was after she was rescued from the groundhog by Wang Ling. She returned to the Office of Strategic Deception screen.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Lihua rushed towards her like rain. She shouted the title of "Master's Wife" loudly in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>This incredible scene appeared in her mind as the memories continued to revive.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. Two streams of hot steam spurted out of her ears on the spot.</p>

    <p>"I need to cool you down! Otherwise it will be dangerous." Sun Ying'er appeared. He sat obediently on the edge of the soft bed and swayed his slender legs.</p>

    <p>Release steam from the ears.</p>

    <p>This is the effect of {Cooling Technique}. Sun Ying'er will implement it according to the situation.</p>

    <p>"Cool down..."</p>

    <p>"Your temperature is too high now! A girl in love must always keep a cool head. Only in this way can she achieve the final victory, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er chuckled: "That stinky Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>But you need me to protect you! So sometimes I will take some necessary measures."</p>

    <p>"You still protect me. Aren't you always bullied by Wang Ying yourself?" Sun Rong also smiled.</p>

    <p>"Bullying? Where is that! I will definitely stand up and be the master. I will fight him to the end!" Sun Ying'er said firmly.</p>

    <p>But when it came to this, she suddenly felt that her body was really uncomfortable...</p>

    <p>It's all because Wang Ying's {Planet thumping technique} was too powerful yesterday!</p>

    <p>"Are you feeling uncomfortable? Do you want me to massage you?"</p>

    <p>"Great! Rongrong is the best! MUA!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er rushed over and kissed Sun Rong on the cheek: "It's all Wang Ying's fault! 406 times! It was executed in one night! It hurt my back!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Hey! Rongrong! Why is your face red again? Hey! Give me a cooling spell!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the Office of Strategic Deception, Boss Mr. Sun made an appointment with Zhuo Yi to meet in the True Venerated Immortal Hall.</p>

    <p>After the two exchanged pleasantries, they took their seats.</p>

    <p>A disciple from the Office of Strategic Deception came to serve tea. After the tea was served, he wisely withdrew and closed the door.</p>

    <p>Make sure no one disturbs you in the main hall.</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo, I came here today for one thing only. I am a straightforward person and not a person who beats around the bush. So I hope General Administration Zhuo can be honest with me."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun smiled and said: "As for the benefits, General Administration Zhuo is definitely indispensable. I know. The Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools is about to elect a new leader candidate. If General Administration Zhuo doesn't hide anything, I will do my best to serve General Administration. To attract votes."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "Mr. Sun is serious. Sugar-coated bullets don't work for me. I want to listen to Mr. Sun's question first. If it involves a friend's secret, I will naturally not reveal a word."</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo. He is indeed a loyal person." Boss Sun nodded.</p>

    <p>What he just said was just a test. And Zhuo Yi did not disappoint him.</p>

    <p>Regarding canvassing for votes. In fact, regardless of whether he got the answer he wanted from Zhuo Yi this time. Mr. Boss Sun will still help.</p>

    <p>He knew what happened to Sun Rong this time. Zhuo Yi also played a big role behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for Sun Yiyuan not to repay this favor and kindness.</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo, don't worry. What I want to discuss this time is definitely not the secrets about General Administration Zhuo's friends. It's General Administration Zhuo's own secrets." Boss Sun said with a smile.</p>

    <p>These words made Zhuo Yi's expression freeze slightly...</p>

    <p>His secret is nothing more than his relationship with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Could it be said that it has been exposed?</p>

    <p>This shouldn't be the case!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned: "So Mr. Sun, what do you want to ask?"</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo has been able to rise to the position of the General Administration in such a short period of time. He has repeatedly made extraordinary achievements and made outstanding contributions. He is deeply loved by Secretary Sun of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance... and I came here this time. In fact, it is also for I came here to inquire about classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun: "So. I need to confirm something. That is the relationship between General Administration Zhuo and classmate Wang Ling. Is it not as simple as it seems on the surface?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked dark: "My classmate Wang Ling and I have a normal relationship between seniors and juniors. We are the same as classmate Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. General Administration Zhuo."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Mr. Boss Sun chuckled: "Since I'm here today, I must be well prepared. I never fight without preparation. I'm sure. Director Zhuo and his classmates Wang Ling relationship. It's definitely not as simple as it seems."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I don't know. Where did Mr. Sun get the news..."</p>

    <p>"It's just a combination of the information I got. The result of precise analysis."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun laughed when he heard this: "So, General Administration Zhuo, just accept it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi pretended not to know: "What do you recognize?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun: "You! You are the master of classmate Wang Ling! What I said is correct?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "???"</p>
