  <h1>Chapter 1398 Friends from the Sword King Realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The overall number of naturally formed secret realms in the universe is not large.</p>

    <p>Within the extraterrestrial galaxy, the total number of all cosmic secret realms is less than forty.</p>

    <p>The factors that form the secret realm of the universe are extremely complex. The ten major families in the God's Domain have invested a lot of resources in exploring the secret realm of the universe and studying the reasons for its formation. So far, it is still not fully understood.</p>

    <p>At present, we only know that the formation of the secret realm of the universe is related to chaos.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, this research does not make much difference whether it is researched or not... But in order to ensure their status as the boss of the ten major families in God's Domain, this research must be done. And since there is research, there must be research funds.</p>

    <p>As for where the oil and water in the funds went, only the people of the ten major families know.</p>

    <p>Studying the nature of the secret realm of the universe is to deepen our understanding of the secret realm so that we can more easily obtain precious resources from the secret realm.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, in the final analysis it is just for the sake of food.</p>

    <p>Take the Sword King Realm as an example. If you can freely enter and exit the Sword King Realm regardless of the blade storm, and freely bring in and out the spiritual swords naturally bred in it, and then buy and resell them, you will make a fortune.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is capable of doing this.</p>

    <p>However, Father Wang and Mother Wang taught him from a young age that he was not allowed to use his abilities to make money.</p>

    <p>So in fact, if Wang Ling can use his abilities, he can definitely become a rich man... not to mention the Sword King Realm. As long as he sells all the death talismans he drew in his hand, that's enough.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao uses his own "Galaxy Magic Armor" skin to safely lead everyone through the blade storm. These sword blades with high psychic powers are actually as fine as dust.</p>

    <p>Just imagine, what would it feel like if every grain of sand on the beach on the coast was a blade?</p>

    <p>Cultivators are involved. Without a very high state, there is no return.</p>

    <p>Even if you can resist it for a while, the blade storm layer is too thick. One mistake and you may fall directly.</p>

    <p>Even if you can finally travel there, you still have to consider the return journey.</p>

    <p>Although Bai Qiao's body is made of peach wood, its hardness is stronger than a metal sword. During the shuttle process, the mecha's skin is scattered with metallic light like bright stars.</p>

    <p>In the end, Bai Qiao led everyone to successfully land on a barren mountain near the coast.</p>

    <p>This is the very famous Broken Sword Mountain in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>It's not so much a mountain. It's actually a huge broken sword, dozens of feet high.</p>

    <p>According to rumors, this was originally a large sword with a very thick body. It was bred in the Sword King Realm thousands of years ago.</p>

    <p>It was as big as a mountain when it was born. Many sword spirits think that the great sword is a rare prodigy. Maybe it can be challenged to break out of the sword storm.</p>

    <p>Then there is no more.</p>

    <p>The attack of Great Sword and Sword Spirit failed.</p>

    <p>Its body is divided into two.</p>

    <p>Half of it fell into the sea of swords ahead. The other half turned into a broken sword and was stuck on the coast forever. It became Broken Sword Mountain.</p>

    <p>Then it became a major attraction in the Sword King world forever.</p>

    <p>Over the past thousand years, countless newly-born sword spirits have "visited here" and carved their own opinions on the story of the Great Sword Spirit's impact on Blade Storm.</p>

    <p>"If you don't seek death, you won't die."</p>

    <p>"So. What's the use of being big? Isn't it just a fat sword?"</p>

    <p>"Fortunately I'm not a big sword!"</p>

    <p>"Just stay in the Sword King Realm honestly. Feel free to attack the Blade Storm. You are seeking death!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the mountain wall of Broken Sword Mountain. Sun Rong can see these words engraved on it everywhere.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that these carvings come from other sword spirits.</p>

    <p>"These rubbish. Resentful of heaven and earth." were the words on the mountain wall. Bai Qiao rolled his eyes on the spot when he saw it.</p>

    <p>She had also heard about this big sword.</p>

    <p>In the former Sword King Realm, after all the sword spirits were born, their first thought was to attack the Blade Storm, even if they failed in the end and paid the price with their lives.</p>

    <p>This was considered an honor in the past.</p>

    <p>What was once regarded as an act of honor is now being interpreted by more and more sword spirits as "overestimating one's capabilities." This serves as a warning to subsequent sword spirits not to challenge Blade Storm at will if they are not confident enough.</p>

    <p>So. This has led to more and more sword spirits in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the new sword spirit was affected by the new ideas and became more and more timid.</p>

    <p>Later, like Jingke, like Yu... those sword spirits who had successfully escaped from the Sword King Realm. In the stories of these new generation sword spirits, they all became legends.</p>

    <p>It was once thought to be impossible.</p>

    <p>"Has Senior Bai Qiao ever returned here?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"You can come back when you want to come back, and you can go out when you want to go out. There's nothing difficult about it." Bai Qiao shrugged her shoulders and sighed: "It's a pity that the new generation of Sword Spirits are not as good as their predecessors, it's really not as good as the next generation."</p>

    <p>In comparison, her Jingke is much better.</p>

    <p>It only took one week to successfully break through the Blade Storm and become recognized as the number one sword spirit among the sword spirits.</p>

    <p>However, Youdao is a good man, not to mention his past bravery. Bai Qiao feels that there is no need to show off the past.</p>

    <p>Without further ado. Sun Rong immediately released Aohai's sword energy and tried to sense the location of the third Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>However, the perception this time was not as smooth as last time on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>There are too many sword spirits in the Sword King Realm. The sword energy is all intertwined into a ball, forming a natural shielding network, which prevents Aohai's sword energy induction from spreading out smoothly.</p>

    <p>"This is why the Lord asked me to bring you here. Although your combat power is strong, it is mainly concentrated on Aohai. Don't think too much of yourself. You must ask for help when you need it. It is wrong to be too proud and complacent. "Bai Qiao reminded.</p>

    <p>This sentence is actually the opinion of other people in the Office of Strategic Deception. However, considering that those people would not say it easily due to their face, Bai Qiao volunteered to stand up and be the bad guy.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong didn't say a single unnecessary argument. He just accepted the advice with a smile on his face: "Senior Bai Qiao said that. I will definitely keep it in mind."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao nodded with satisfaction: "Just wait. I also have a few friends in the King of Swords world. This time they will lead the way and take us to replace the Rubik's Cube."</p>

    <p>"Friend?"Sun Rong raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Less than three minutes passed. A hundred meters ahead, Sun Rong relied on their sword energy to sense three people approaching them at light speed.</p>

    <p>One woman and two men. The leading female sword spirit was wearing a black leather tight-fitting battle suit. It perfectly outlined her sexy and concave figure.</p>

    <p>"Very strong sword energy." Er Ha felt it slightly and said.</p>

    <p>Soon, the three sword spirits turned into streams of light and appeared in front of them at high speed. Then they all knelt on one knee and greeted Bai Qiao: "Sir Bai Qiao! I was late waiting to welcome you! Please forgive me!"</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Everyone, get up."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao wanted to blame her, but she felt that quarreling again would only delay her time to complete the task and go back to play games.</p>

    <p>So. She gave up.</p>

    <p>"This is Carter."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao pointed at the female sword spirit in front of him. He introduced to Sun Rong and Er Ha: "Carter's body is a short sword. Her special skill is the Death Lotus. It can divide itself into thousands of swords. Then it forms Tornado."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, she turned her attention to the remaining two male sword spirits.</p>

    <p>One of them has a face as white as snow. In modern terms, he looks like a sissy. He has great potential to become an idol star. He is the kind of boy who is very popular with girls.</p>

    <p>The other one had a beard and was dressed like a Spartan warrior.</p>

    <p>"This one with very white skin is called Wu Jin. His special skill is killing with one hit. He is the sword spirit of choice for cultivators who like to use critical strike style sword techniques."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao introduced one by one: "This bearded man. You can call him Lao Man. The five-second real man in Sword Spirit. He can achieve short-term invincibility in five seconds. Even Jingke's World-Destroying Sword can block it. Five seconds You'll be a fool in seconds. And the cooldown time is very long."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "That classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao: "Oh. Your Majesty is an exception. Even if you give him fifty seconds of invincibility, it will be useless. Should he be crushed, he should be crushed."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the three sword spirits sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>They don't actually call it that name at all...</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao forcibly changed their names.</p>

    <p>It is said that their special skills are very similar to the mechanism in a certain game. It makes it easier to call it this way...</p>
