  <h1>Chapter 2208 Luck and misfortune</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Unfortunately, the Sad Frog was stopped directly by Sun Rong before it launched its first round of attack. He kicked the doll suit in the abdomen. Several ribs were broken on the spot.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the person who kicked this sad frog was Sun Rong instead of Wang Ling. If it had been Wang Ling, even if it was just the lightest blow, maybe only the remaining The lower half of the body is gone.</p>

    <p>When he knelt down at the feet of Sun Rong, Wang Ling, the sad frog knelt on the ground in pain and gasped hard. The heartbreaking pain forced him to break out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"It's you...Number 60 High School again!" He stared at Sun Rong fiercely. He directly recognized the identity of the famous eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. But for Sun Rong, This young man wearing a hood is not easy for him to make judgments.</p>

    <p>But even so, Sad Frog knew very well that the two were together. Because Wang Ling was wearing a hood, he couldn't see Wang Ling's face clearly. But he knew Sun Rong face.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that looking at the entire sect circle in the cultivation world, Number 60 High School today is a very explosive existence. Ever since Zhuo Yi became a city hero and gradually rose to prominence, this sect has become famous in the college circle. Crazy rise from the bottom of the rankings.</p>

    <p>Obviously more than half a year ago, this was just a small, unpopular Foundation Building sect. Now it has become a terrifying monster sect.</p>

    <p>It's not that Number 60 High School's current teaching staff is so scary. After all, the information of all teachers is published on Huaxiu Alliance's comprehensive campus information network. There is basically no possibility of fraud.</p>

    <p>On the whole, Number 60 High School's teacher quality is really average. However, in the past half year or so, countless political forces have fallen into the hands of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Many sects have even held unified meetings to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Number 60 High School's current student and teacher levels. As a result, no clear analysis has been made.</p>

    <p>So for the vast majority of people who already know Number 60 High School, the fear of Number 60 High School does not lie in how strong it is on paper. It is this fear. It comes from the unknown of Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>Although helping Zhi Jiunian has many benefits, at this critical juncture, Sad Frog's thinking is very clear. That is the situation at hand. It is definitely not something he can afford to offend.</p>

    <p>To put it another way, even if the person standing in front of him is not the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group Sun Rong. Facing today's Number 60 High School, he still has a sense of awe...</p>

    <p>What's more, the person standing in front of me is the serious future successor of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sad Frog directly did two things. That is to interrupt the contact with Zhi Jiunian first, creating the illusion of entering into chaos.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in front of Wang Ling and Sun Rong, he very religiously took off his doll costume hood and revealed his face.</p>

    <p>This is a man with a delicate round face and dark skin. He is not too old. He looks like he is in his thirties. His upper body muscles are very well developed. He is a practitioner.</p>

    <p>Being able to take the current kick from Sun Rong without completely fainting proves that this person's physical fitness is online. It is not weak, but it is at an average level.</p>

    <p>It is absolutely enough to deal with these stowaway aliens on board, whose average level is only the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>"My name is Pan Lei."</p>

    <p>After announcing his home, he first swallowed a pill that could quickly stabilize internal injuries. Then he looked at Wang Ling and Sun Rong with serious faces. He said something that made both of them a little nervous. If it's unexpected.</p>

    <p>"Although Miss Sun doesn't recognize me, I do know Miss Sun. Speaking of which, I also have some connections with Number 60 High School..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong looked at each other for a moment. Then Sun Rong asked: "Are you also a graduate of Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Pan Lei sighed and replied: "I have relatives who work at Number 60 High School. And they are suffocating relatives."</p>

    <p>Immediate relatives...</p>

    <p>Using the Great Blood Origin Technique in Heavenly Dao. Wang Ling can freely use King's Eyes to observe the blood connection of a living being. Combined with the last name and age of the man in front of him, the answer almost appears on the paper.</p>

    <p>"Pan...Teacher Pan?"Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Yes. The teacher Pan Shengcong you mentioned is my mother."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was stunned. He turned to Wang Ling to confirm the answer.</p>

    <p>I saw. Wang Ling pulled the brim of the hood and pressed it down. He nodded to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong almost fainted on the spot when she saw this. What did she just do? She almost kicked her class teacher's son away...</p>

    <p>However, both Wang Ling and Sun Rong seemed a little stunned by Pan Lei's unexpected appearance and the fact that he was working for Zhi Jiunian.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only know that Teacher Pan and his grandfather had a green life when they were young. But I never know about Teacher Pan's current family life. When I was studying at Number 60 High School, I never heard of Teacher Pan. A son.</p>

    <p>"I don't have a good relationship with my mother. I haven't been home for a long time."</p>

    <p>Faced with doubts, Pan Lei explained the matter in a few words.</p>

    <p>At this time, he gradually regained his composure. He stood up and said, "I'm sorry, you two. I will explain the details to you later. Now I still have to think of a way to better explain the situation to my current boss. The time gap is too long. Soon. He will become suspicious."</p>
