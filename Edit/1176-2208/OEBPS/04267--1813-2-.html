  <h1>Chapter 1813 Living in a dark secret room with Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because it is a recorded variety show challenge, all dramatic changes are within the control of Lawen. Before the variety show is edited, the guests will often be stimulated to make many unexpected things in order to enrich the elements. External feedback. Finally, editing is used to make the program more interesting and exciting.</p>

    <p>Sometimes in order to create a topic, we do not rule out the use of some malicious editing techniques... These are the unspoken rules of the industry.</p>

    <p>Compared to the indifferent Number 60 High School here, the performance of the six prodigies in the Uzumaki Emperor was extremely exciting. They were also trapped in the secret room in groups of two and two. However, these people used different methods to break free from the chains in front of them.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the six top geniuses among the new representatives of the Uzumaki Emperor. They can actually rely on their own spiritual roots to match their compatibility. Based on their spiritual roots, they can extract trace elements from the air and synthesize simple materials for making Talisman."</p>

    <p>Cinnabar, yellow talisman, spiritual water, writing brush.</p>

    <p>In the first Talisman class at Number 60 High School, it was actually mentioned that these are the four basic raw materials for making Talisman. But sometimes it is impossible to have such complete materials in extreme environments. You can only find them separately.</p>

    <p>It uses trace elements extracted from the air to condense into powdery element crystals. That is a material that can perfectly replace cinnabar.</p>

    <p>If there is no yellow talisman, you can also tear your clothes into strips of cloth as a substitute. A powerful person can even bite the fingertips to write Talisman style directly on the rough ground or even in the air.</p>

    <p>Because the spiritual power in their bodies is strong enough. The spiritual energy in the blood is strong enough to replace specific spiritual water. As for the fingers, they are ready-made materials used to replace the brush barrels.</p>

    <p>Of course, some people will pluck out their own hair and use it to write.</p>

    <p>The six people in the Uzumaki Emperor used almost the same methods. They all used the method of writing Talisman to help themselves out of trouble.</p>

    <p>The two people in the secret room Number 1 of the Uzumaki Emperor are both water spirit root users. They created Talisman, a corrosive mist that is harmless to the human body but highly corrosive to metals. They gradually deepened the concentration of the mist, causing the chain to be corroded. Corroded by fog.</p>

    <p>This method is very slow, but effective enough. The program producers judged that it would take about two hours for the two people to escape completely.</p>

    <p>Those with golden spiritual roots and fire spiritual roots were imprisoned in the Number 2 secret room. The methods used were even more shocking.</p>

    <p>They directly made the weapon-enhanced Talisman. They enchanted and strengthened the metal saw lying around!</p>

    <p>"He even mastered such a complicated strengthening formula." Many program producers were astonished when they looked at the pictures coming from the camera.</p>

    <p>As long as the metal saw is strengthened to level +6, it can easily cut off the chain... But this kind of strengthening is actually very eye-catching. If it fails in the middle, you have to start from the beginning and strengthen it again.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the two men took off their coats and divided them into countless strips of cloth, as if they were ready for a big fight.</p>

    <p>If everything goes well, the program team predicts that these two people will get out of trouble the fastest.</p>

    <p>The last two prodigies in the Uzumaki Emperor were from the Earth Spirit Root and the Wood Spirit Root. These two people combined their actual conditions and started to modify their own arms using the simple Talisman they drew.</p>

    <p>This is a method of assimilating part of the body with nature. Although the shackles restrict the human body, you can easily break free of the shackles by turning your arms into soil, branches or the like.</p>

    <p>If there is light, their assimilation speed will be greatly increased. Unfortunately, the dark environment limits their assimilation speed. Otherwise, this group of people would definitely have escaped first.</p>

    <p>After comparing these six people in Uzumaki Emperor, the people at Number 60 High School are obviously more stupid... This kind of comparison can be said to be very obvious.</p>

    <p>"No way...are they really all salted fish?" Mrs. Lawen took a breath and showed a somewhat unbelievable expression. According to the intelligence data she received, at least one of the people in Number 60 High School is also a hidden master. They can't all be indifferent.</p>

    <p>But considering the situation at hand, the people at Number 60 High School didn't even have the slightest reaction.</p>

    <p>Could it be that the information was wrong?</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen frowned. She took out a prepared remote control device from her arms. It was... the senior standing behind her. In order to cooperate with the experimental equipment given to her in this variety show challenge.</p>

    <p>Also known as - the strong person identifies the remote control!</p>

    <p>As long as she presses the button, the three secret rooms in Number 60 High School will enter the "increase intensity" mode. At that time, more dangerous things will happen. In situations of crisis, people often have to be prepared for what is coming. React to danger. You must be able to see some clues.</p>

    <p>However, if the intensity of the three secret rooms is increased at the same time, innocent people will definitely be affected. Although the test itself is also Lawen's purpose, her original intention is just to find out the hidden master.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after thinking about it, Mrs. Lawen made a decision. That is to test the secret rooms of Wang Ling and Sun Rong that she suspected most first...</p>

    <p>She had a kind face. She secretly pressed the independent button of the strong identification remote control in her pocket.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the eight-foot-wide dark square secret room. The moment Mrs. Lawen pressed the button on the strongman identification remote control, Wang Ling immediately noticed the abnormal changes in the secret room.</p>

    <p>Although he and Sun Rong were still burying their faces in their knees, pretending to be afraid of the darkness. But when this inexplicable pressure from outside came, Wang Ling suddenly opened his eyes in the darkness.</p>

    <p>This is the breath of the Eternal One... It is the same as Lord Haiyao Jushi that Sun Rong met before. It has the same smell. When Lord Haiyao Jushi faced the messenger from heaven, he called it the Holy Lord. And the bigger protective umbrella standing behind that holy lord is the legendary holy king.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Wang Ling immediately reacted. This Eternal One, who was now united with Lawen and sent to test them, was most likely from the Holy King's side.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to do it originally.</p>

    <p>But the identification of strong people is really a bit difficult.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that this Eternal One is much stronger than Haiyao Jushi who was sent to deal with Sun Rong earlier. If this is left to Sun Rong to deal with it, he is afraid it will be a little bit... It's beyond the scope.</p>

    <p>What kind of eternal being is this?</p>

    <p>A snow-white skeleton wearing a black cloak. His eyes are hollow and deep. It seems as if it can suck people into an era of exile. It is much more powerful than Li Xian and Zhang Zhui!</p>

    <p>This is an Eternal with an undead body... Wang Ling judged. This Eternal is not a human being. It is a member of a rare race that once appeared in the universe. A member of the Undead.</p>

    <p>Judging from the aura released by this snow-white skeleton, this person is most likely the remaining king of the undead.</p>

    <p>So. In darkness, when this new Eternal One appeared in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling snapped his fingers almost immediately.</p>

    <p>Let the time of the entire universe freeze at the same moment.</p>

    <p>Only he and this king of the undead can still move...</p>

    <p>Then he patted the dust off his butt. He stood up from the ground and stood in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Is it you?" Obviously, this undead Eternal was a little surprised. He never expected that Wang Ling was the person who had been hiding...</p>
