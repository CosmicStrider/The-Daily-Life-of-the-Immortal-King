  <h1>Chapter 2183 The double game between reality and illusionâ‘£</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! Itinerant Immortal's magic circle. A large number of players come from all over the game world.</p>

    <p>Just to witness with my own eyes the rare spectacle of Mr. Canghu using the ancient method of refining elixirs from an active volcano.</p>

    <p>Not only is the Itinerant Immortal game world gathering a huge number of players.</p>

    <p>Countless viewers in the real world outside the game world have also begun to care about this live broadcast, which is unprecedented in the history of games.</p>

    <p>Inside the Office of Strategic Deception. Bai Qiao is in the central control room of the Internet cafe. There are many disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception operating the computers in front of them in an orderly manner. The underground of the Internet cafe is the server of Itinerant Immortal. Just setting up the server is enough. It has built six entire underground floors.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure that the game can run smoothly without lag, the Office of Strategic Deception has also recruited many cutting-edge technology monks in the real world.</p>

    <p>They don't have much practical experience, and their realm itself is not high. But their academic qualifications are unparalleled. They are the type of people who have mastered the theoretical school in the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>In fact, the modern world of cultivation needs the existence of such people. Only in this way can the development of modern cultivation technology be truly promoted.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao is holding a tablet computer. Looking at the rising game data, he can't help but feel a little excited in his heart. As a developer of the game, this kind of excitement can only be experienced by personal participants.</p>

    <p>"Elder Bai Qiao. The number of people online in the game has exceeded 400 million! The number of live broadcast viewers around the world watching active volcanoes making alchemy has exceeded one billion!" said a member of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>This level of attention has already broken the best record for a new game this year. However, compared to the large-scale multi-terminal open world game {original Immortal} that created the myth of game history, it is still a little behind.</p>

    <p>Of course. Looking at the tens of billions of monks around the world, the achievements of these two ceiling games in today's world of cultivation are nothing more than rare.</p>

    <p>Although it is a pity, as a newcomer in the gaming industry, Bai Qiao is still full of confidence in his future.</p>

    <p>{Itinerant Immortal's Magic Ring} is no worse than {Original Immortal}. It is still limited by the limitations of the login device. After all, not all players can have a holographic game cabin.</p>

    <p>Of course. There are also simple versions of holographic simulation helmets on the market. You only need to put on the helmet and connect it to your phone through the data cable. Just enter it through the phone port.</p>

    <p>However, after entering the simple version of the helmet, it is affected by various factors. Neither the game fluency nor the overall experience is as strong as the holographic cabin.</p>

    <p>Many players play games just for convenience, relaxation and happiness. This is why the popularity of {Itinerant Immortal} is not as high as {Original}.</p>

    <p>Summarizing experience is always necessary. But now Bai Qiao, in addition to analyzing game data, also needs to be wary of Bai Zhe's actions.</p>

    <p>The entire game world is gradually becoming real.</p>

    <p>Many disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception who are processing data here have already discovered the clues.</p>

    <p>They discovered that in the sky background of the game world, there was a large group of indescribable gray fog that could not be modified or deleted.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao naturally knows what this is.</p>

    <p>But in order to avoid causing panic, I still responded with a "bug" in the game. I pretended to create a team of programmers to fix this "bug" that could not be fixed at all with the existing technology.</p>

    <p>For Bai Qiao, it can only be postponed for a while. He only hopes that the sword master Wang Ling can successfully assist Mr. Canghu in completing this "Wall Breaker Project."</p>

    <p>In the carriage, Wang Ling witnessed a large number of players riding their own mounts and bringing magic weapons to the crater near Fuyun Town. It was a chaotic scene. Each person had their own unique characteristics. Let Wang Ling stand in a moment It reminds me of the feeling I had as a gamer watching movies before.</p>

    <p>"The ancient method of refining elixirs from active volcanoes. I didn't expect that someone actually understands this."</p>

    <p>"Who is this senior who looks like a Canghu? Why did he make himself look like this?"</p>

    <p>"What do you mean? Are heretical players not worthy of playing games?"</p>

    <p>Many people have begun to have a strong curiosity about Mr. Canghu. However, itinerant Immortal has thousands of spoof players. Not everyone wants to make themselves look like handsome guys or beauties. A large part of the heretics are not Mainstream players like to make their characters look like Cthulhu aliens.</p>

    <p>Near the active volcano. Under the deliberate layout of Wang Ling, plus a fleet of NPCs hired by Mr. Canghu, the nearby area was directly surrounded by an iron barrel.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu spent some silver and spiritual stones to set up magic circles on all sides. He mobilized troops in this way because he was worried about being disturbed by external factors.</p>

    <p>However, whether the active volcano alchemy can successfully produce the elixir is no longer important to Mr. Canghu. The first phase of his Wall Breaker Project mission has been successfully completed.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of players gathered here. This is a bait for Bai Zhe. I just don't know if Bai Zhe will start the operation normally.</p>

    <p>And the facts proved that everything was as expected by Wang Ling. Bai Zhe, who had been doing "business", did not miss this rare opportunity.</p>

    <p>The strange gray fog that shrouds the world of Itinerant Immortal is gathering in large quantities in the direction of Fuyun Town...</p>
