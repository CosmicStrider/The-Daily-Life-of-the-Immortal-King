  <h1>Chapter 1392 A love letter to Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Number 60 The first day of high school resumption. This means that Wang Ling no longer has to take online classes, record study videos at home, or receive online roll call from Teacher Pan every morning. Who else has not handed in their homework during the public execution? 's message.</p>

    <p>He thought his life was finally back on track.</p>

    <p>But it turns out there's more to the problem than that...</p>

    <p>One night before resuming school, Wang Ling's eyelids began to twitch regularly.</p>

    <p>Although the level is not particularly high, this is obviously a bad warning.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling's eyelid warning has a new understanding and improvement of the level of trouble after experiencing many incidents. Ordinary minor troubles will no longer trigger warnings easily.</p>

    <p>Unless what happens next. A relatively explosive event...</p>

    <p>First day back to school. Will there be big trouble?</p>

    <p>As expected of myself!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought to himself.</p>

    <p>In front of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the new look of Number 60 High School. It is indeed much more luxurious than imagined...</p>

    <p>The statue of Zhuo Yi in front of the door with a flying sword at its feet surprised Wang Ling. No one else. It was just because the posture was too crude.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remember that Zhuo Yi was very proud to explain to him the black technology of this statue last night.</p>

    <p>It is said that the big pendulum clock on the teaching building of Number 60 High School was merged with the statue of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has a flying sword on his feet. The point where the sword point is pointed is the hour hand. The right hand is the second hand and the minute hand. So the whole statue will continue to change posture as time goes by.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most ridiculous place is every time at 12 o'clock at noon and 12 o'clock at midnight.</p>

    <p>The Zhuo Yi statue's crotch will automatically open a hole. A golden pendulum will descend from inside. It will swing between the thighs...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked along the school square towards the teaching building. I saw many students queuing up on both sides of the school square.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao, two treasures, were in the queue. They happened to be at the end of the queue.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling!!" Guo Hao greeted from a distance.</p>

    <p>The little fat man obviously neglected to exercise during this period at home. Wang Ling felt that Guo Hao seemed to have gained a lot of weight compared to before.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling himself is also fat. Fortunately, he has already used the {Big Fat Technique} to rub off the fat. The meat that was rubbed off is now stored in the King's Eyes space, just in case of emergencies. needs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what the two of them were doing in line, so they walked over to take a look.</p>

    <p>He shouldn't be a person who likes good things.</p>

    <p>But I couldn't stand the warm greetings of Chen Chao and Guo Hao. It would seem a bit impolite if I didn't respond.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel like you have dark circles under your eyes Wang Ling? You look like you haven't woken up. I don't know, but you thought you were saving the world again when you were at home!" Chen Chao took the initiative to hook Wang Ling shoulder.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly: "..."</p>

    <p>He knew Chen Chao was joking.</p>

    <p>These days, people are criticized for having dark circles under their eyes. How dare he show off his dark circles?</p>

    <p>It's true that I didn't sleep well. It's not because I didn't sleep enough that my mental state looked bad. On the one hand, it was because...</p>

    <p>It's a dead fish eye. This kind of eye shape always gives people the feeling of not getting enough sleep.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, yesterday's sudden eyelid warning scared the child Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But obviously, the eyelid warning should not refer to the matter at hand.</p>

    <p>"Our school is really rich. There is a teleportation array in the school square!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao introduced to Wang Ling: "This is specially created for students who are late. It is open 24 hours a day. All the data has been input into the backend of the school's array control system. As long as you enter the school square, you can directly step into the teleportation array. Teleport to the door of your classroom. Up to 10 people can be teleported at one time."</p>

    <p>"Hmm..."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He finally understood... This is the legendary welfare for lazy people.</p>

    <p>However, such a formation is actually not needed to reach their classroom on the first floor. The time to walk there is much faster than queuing to teleport.</p>

    <p>"This is the first time. Let's experience it. The main reason is that our school's facilities are now bigger. The teaching buildings are a few wider.</p>

    <p>Some people couldn't figure out where the classroom was for a while," Chen Chao said. Soon, it was their turn.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao hooked Wang Ling and Chen Chao's shoulders and walked in together.</p>

    <p>"Wait for me!!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Su Xiao rushed over and caught the last bus. Before the teleportation, he still bowed and apologized to the person behind him: "I'm sorry! We are in the same class!"</p>

    <p>Alumni who were still waiting in line didn't mind too much.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and others appeared at the door of Class 1 and Class 3.</p>

    <p>A classroom on the far right side of Teaching Building Number 1.</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more...</p>

    <p>Smoke began to rise from the school square.</p>

    <p>The teleportation circle just used by Wang Ling was broken on the spot!</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "What happened? It broke just after we used it."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "It must be used too frequently. Because this formation is originally used for people who are about to be late. The maximum number of transfers is 10 at one time. We only went up to 4. It is not overloaded! Unless someone weighs more than 1,000 kilograms. ah!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After successfully returning to the classroom, Su Xiao began to collect homework. Because the homework was completed online, this time he collected all USB flash drives.</p>

    <p>So far, except for the teleportation array outside, nothing special seems to have happened...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling still maintains full vigilance.</p>

    <p>Come and collect Wang Ling U disk life. Su Xiao said: "Wang Ling. There seems to be something in your storage box. All the storage boxes. Only yours is lit."</p>

    <p>"Storage box?"Wang Ling was startled.</p>

    <p>"This is a newly added facility in the school. Everyone has one. It seems that the benefits given out by the school during the holidays are all delivered to the storage box. Everyone can pick it up by themselves. The pick-up place for our class is next door. And the second class It's merged." Su Xiao pointed to the direction.</p>

    <p>"Who would be stuffing something into your locker this early in the morning?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was curious. He hummed and smiled: "Could it be..."</p>

    <p>"A love letter..."</p>

    <p>?I don't think the possibility is very high." Chen Chao raised his eyebrows. His tone of voice couldn't help but become sour: "Last semester, Wang Ling didn't receive a single love letter! Nine times out of ten, it was Whose prank is it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent: "..."</p>

    <p>So now it seems that the contents in the storage box are indeed the prank love letters delivered by someone.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. He has the habit of arriving at school early.</p>

    <p>While there aren't many people there yet, just take your things out quickly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quickly stood up and went to the storage room next door to find a box.</p>

    <p>As Su Xiao said, of all the storage boxes, his is the one with the red light on. He can find it at a glance.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Chen Chao followed behind to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>"The default password is four zeros. Wang Ling Please open it quickly and take a look."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao looked like he was watching the fun and not taking it too seriously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Enter password.</p>

    <p>Ding!</p>

    <p>A pile of envelopes sealed with love stickers fell from the box with a crash. In an instant, they reached Wang Ling's knees...</p>

    <p>This scene just caught the attention of Sun Rong who was passing by.</p>
