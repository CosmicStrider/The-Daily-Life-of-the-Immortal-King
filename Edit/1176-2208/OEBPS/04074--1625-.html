  <h1>Chapter 1625 I'm really not Jiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong never thought that someone would kidnap her in broad daylight. However, when the slime man announced her name, Sun Rong was stunned for a moment, then showed an extremely incredulous look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying...</p>

    <p>Why did she become Jiang Yingying again!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held his head and stared at the slime man in front of him: "I'm sorry. If you are looking for classmate Jiang, I'm afraid you have mistaken the person. I am really not classmate Jiang Yingying."</p>

    <p>"You don't admit it?" The slime man frowned slightly. He glanced at a tree nearby. He only raised his arm. In an instant, his arm was stretched infinitely in his sight. It was like a pitch-black whip heading towards Remove the tree trunk.</p>

    <p>The force of one blow shattered the old sycamore tree into powder on the spot...</p>

    <p>However, this did not scare Sun Rong. She was still sitting in the car with her arms folded: "It seems. I said I am not Jiang Yingying. Don't you believe it?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I won't believe it." The slime man sneered: "Don't think I don't know. Today, the Martial Saint Jiang went to see the Sun Rong girl. The Intelligence Department said that they had a secret conversation in the student union office for a long time. So. They must be discussing some kind of subcontracting plan to exchange the civet cat for the prince."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Slime Man: "After reasoning and analysis by the chief of the intelligence department, he determined that the Sun Rong girl had no choice but to agree to Martial Saint Jiang's request to change identities in order to protect the safety of classmate Jiang Yingying. The two of you were originally They look very similar. As long as they make a few changes in their hairstyle, it's enough to hide them."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong sighed slightly in his heart.</p>

    <p>She was unable to complain about the head of the Intelligence Section who had a confusing logic. She was just curious about the organization operating behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>In short, judging from the current situation, Jiang Yingying is indeed being targeted... The other party's target from the beginning was not him, but Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>And the other party now believes that they have exchanged identities.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Jiang Yingying, who is lying in the hospital now, is absolutely safe.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong doesn't know what this group of people is going to do. But this seems to be a good opportunity to find out the context of the matter.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I can go with you. But you have to let the driver go. He is innocent."</p>

    <p>"That's easy to say. We just need you to come with us. It doesn't matter if you let the other people go." The slime man spread his hands and smiled: "You are quite sensible. But why didn't you admit it earlier? You obviously That's classmate Jiang Yingying."</p>

    <p>"I didn't admit it at all, okay. I obviously wasn't..." Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She was quite speechless about the intelligence gathering abilities of these people. She also deeply suspected that the chief of the intelligence section might have suffered from the sequelae of reading too many novels.</p>

    <p>This is so mind-blowing!</p>

    <p>She dares to think...</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang had definitely come to the student union office to look for her.</p>

    <p>But the plot here is completely different!</p>

    <p>Without any testimony, I actually just made up a plot and inserted it into it, but it's okay...</p>

    <p>"Stop pretending. Classmate Jiang Yingying. You are."</p>

    <p>"I'm not!"</p>

    <p>"You have already decided to leave with me. Is there any point in still worrying about this?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed: "Okay. I am..."</p>

    <p>"Look! You said you're not Jiang Yingying!" The slime man snorted and smiled, looking like he was in control.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Miss!" When he saw Sun Rong, he was about to leave with the slime man. Jiang Xiaoche hurriedly got out of the car. He opened his hand. A spiritual light appeared from his hand. He tried to summon a spiritual sword to fight back.</p>

    <p>"Hmph. Be honest!"</p>

    <p>However, the slime man was extremely fast. He swung out a kick and hit Jiang Xiaoche's ribs!</p>

    <p>Before the summoning of the spirit sword was completed, Jiang Xiaoche felt a huge force in his chest. He flew backwards on the spot, broke the guardrail on the roadside, and passed out on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. He won't die. I left some strength with my kick. But the road is very remote. Whether anyone will come to save him depends on his luck." After the slime man finished speaking, he immediately took out a pill. The capsule hit the ground hard.</p>

    <p>Along with a burst of smoke, a modified black van appeared in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This is a disposable space capsule used to store large equipment. Just smash it on the ground to release the items stored in the capsule.</p>

    <p>"Get in the car, classmate Jiang Yingying." The slime man sneered. He escorted Sun Rong into the back of the van.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked to find that this was an unmanned vehicle. Everything had been set. As soon as she got in, the van started driving automatically according to the set route.</p>

    <p>Moreover, there is a psychic barrier in the rear compartment, which is used to block spiritual consciousness. Normal cultivators cannot perceive the outside world through it.</p>

    <p>Of course. It is impossible to block the current Sun Rong with this barrier alone.</p>

    <p>But if it were really Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Jiang Yingying doesn't even know where he will be taken in the end.</p>

    <p>"What is your purpose?" Sun Rong's hands were tied behind his back. He was sitting in the position with a very calm expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"The granddaughter of Martial Saint. She's a bit of a hero." Slime Man couldn't help but praise her. And then, he showed his hand, "But... what is it that I want from you? I don' t know what I'm looking for. I don't know. Our Intelligence Division. We're only responsible for collecting information and capturing people."</p>

    <p>"Since you know that I am the granddaughter of Martial Saint Jiang, aren't you afraid of offending Martial Saint?" Sun Rong asked again.</p>

    <p>Now that she had decided to pretend to be Jiang Yingying for the time being, she thought she might be able to use this identity to get some useful information.</p>

    <p>However, after hearing this, the slime man stared at her and looked her up and down.</p>

    <p>As if she had heard some great joke. Showing a funny expression: "Don't worry. Martial Saint will not find us. He'll still be able to get along with that student Jiang Yingying. He'll still be a model grandfather ."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Sun Rong was confused.</p>

    <p>She was confused by what she said. But no matter how she asked, the slime man remained silent and didn't say another word during the rest of the journey.</p>

    <p>In the car, the girl amplified her spiritual consciousness and crossed the barrier.</p>

    <p>She noticed that the van had been circling on the highway.</p>

    <p>This group of people has a strong sense of counter-reconnaissance. They leave their traces everywhere. They also specially set up one-time teleportation arrays at hidden intersections. This allows the van to frequently shuttle back and forth on every road in the city. It is very confusing. It is impossible to tell where its final movement will be.</p>

    <p>After driving for about two hours, Sun Rong discovered that the van was transported by a teleportation array to an open area in the northern suburbs.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the slime man who had been silent for a long time finally spoke again: "Boss, I have brought classmate Jiang Yingying. Do you want to go see Madam immediately?"</p>

    <p>On the other side of the phone came the electronically processed voice of the head of the intelligence department: "My wife is mysophobic. I have already told you that you must wash her before sending her back."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>At this time, the slime man raised his lips and said, "Then, can I help her wash it myself?"</p>
