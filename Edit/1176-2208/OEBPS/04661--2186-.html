  <h1>Chapter 2186 Lao Huang's true identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! Wang Ling, Sun Rong Although they have not met Lao Huang in the real world, it is undeniable that through these days of getting along in Fuyun Town, they are on the same page. I think Lao Huang has an interesting soul. He is a naturally optimistic person. Being with him seems to make people feel relaxed.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of magical power in Lao Huang. He seems to be able to harmonize the surrounding atmosphere very well. This is due to Lao Huang's personal charm and the emotional intelligence accumulated from his rich social experience.</p>

    <p>At the same time, regarding the experiences Lao Huang mentioned, such as account suspension compensation, Wang Ming learned that these indeed happened.</p>

    <p>But Lao Huang's current player data cannot be found at all. This is very abnormal. Generally speaking, even if players actively consume it, their data will be sealed by the game company. This is to prevent some people from using this malicious method. The method of consumption extorts players. It also gives players a chance to regret.</p>

    <p>So even if Lao Huang takes the initiative to cancel the account, it is impossible not to have any data left. This group of player data is like evaporating from the world. It has completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming found it a bit unbelievable. He even felt that there was something unusual behind the disappearance of Lao Huang's data.</p>

    <p>That night, Bai Qiao, as the official operator of {Itinerant Immortal}, issued an announcement for server suspension and rectification. The wording of the content was exactly the same as the news recently released by Heavy Rain, a major player in the industry.</p>

    <p>Because the contract renewal was not negotiated, the Huaxiu country agent game company failed to successfully obtain the right to renew the contract. Many of the games published by Heavy Rain Company in the Huaxiu country region will also face game server closure. This is very important to players in the game industry. It was undoubtedly a major earthquake.</p>

    <p>As a new game company backed by the Office of Strategic Deception, Bai Qiao respects these industry veterans in the game circle very much. Therefore, he is very cautious even in the wording of the service suspension announcement.</p>

    <p>For example, the data of all game players will be archived. The data will be restored when the game resumes operations. An equal amount of compensation will be provided based on the date of the archive.</p>

    <p>And the last sentence. We will go hand in hand with all Itinerant Immortal players and fight until the last second!</p>

    <p>But even so, there are still voices of abuse on the Internet.</p>

    <p>The discontinuation of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring has caused dissatisfaction among many fanatical fans.</p>

    <p>A casual cultivator faced the interview with the news reporter and showed a fierce look: "Are you worthy of us? Please refund the money!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In today's online world, people's hearts are complex and impetuous. It is never possible to satisfy everyone. In the face of some negative voices, you can only stay calm as much as possible and digest it yourself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembers when I participated in the spirit sword exchange meeting with the fifty-nine gates in the first semester. There were also some bad voices on the campus forum.</p>

    <p>But in his opinion, those negative news are a bit too childish. Not even a trace of mood swings can affect him.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, ignoring is the best response to these trolls who only hide on the Internet and shout.</p>

    <p>And. Wang Ling feels that there are very few things in this world that can cause him to have emotional fluctuations. If there is really someone who can make him have an emotional reaction. Wang Ling feels that he should really thank this person.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling turned on the phone and found that Sun Rong had edited a large number of messages for himself.</p>

    <p>To sum up, Lao Huang's data is missing. And Wang Ming has tried all methods so far. None of the data can be recovered.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ming's ability, even Wang Ming cannot recover this data. This only means one thing. That is, Lao Huang's data did not exist from the beginning.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master, you mean, Lao Huang is a virtual person?" Jingke asked.</p>

    <p>"No. If it is a virtual person affected by the gray fog, the data will still remain after the restrictions of the gray fog are lifted." Wang Ying frowned. Analyzed: "So after ruling out all possibilities, the only possibility left is The result is that Lao Huang never existed from the beginning. He was a maverick individual formed due to complicated reasons.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling heard this. He couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying said is exactly what he wanted to express.</p>

    <p>This person, Lao Huang, did not exist from the beginning. To be precise, Lao Huang was affected by the gray fog and a wonderful chemical reaction occurred with the game data in the Itinerant Immortal magic ring.</p>

    <p>His prototype. If Wang Ling guessed correctly, he should be an NPC in the Itinerant Immortal magic circle.</p>

    <p>Yes. Lao Huang is different from an NPPC. Lao Huang developed intelligence through his own learning ability. He has his own independent thinking consciousness. And finally became a real character under the influence of gray fog.</p>

    <p>From his communication with other players, Lao Huang, who is an NPC, began to believe that he was a player in the real world. He also made up a set of real-life identities for himself that could deceive him.</p>

    <p>In fact, this real identity was made up by Lao Huang from beginning to end and does not exist at all.</p>

    <p>Including Lao Huang's character, family environment and other factors related to Lao Huang...</p>

    <p>In this regard, Wang Ling seemed particularly helpless. He looked at Sun Rong's extremely anxious text message. Inexplicably, a kind of compassion began to show in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Wang Ling finds that he always seems to be particularly concerned about her requests. Especially when he sees her looking so anxious. Although there is no other emotional reaction in his heart, there is only one thought in his mind. That is to agree to her request...</p>

    <p>As long as he can do it, everything can be promised.</p>

    <p>So now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his five fingers and used his child power to absorb a small ball of the strange gray mist sealed in Wang Tong into his palm.</p>

    <p>He decided to resurrect Lao Huang and give Lao Huang a new identity in the real world...so that he could continue to survive in the modern world of cultivation in a true human form...</p>
