  <h1>Chapter 1871 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The authentic original of the Book of Nine Families. The so-called only threshold for Dao Ancestor Wang to recruit true disciples. The existence that has been chased by cultivators in the entire cultivation world for eternity now appears in the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>Being able to get even such an object proves that the president of this auction house is no ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling became deeply curious about this.</p>

    <p>There are so many auction houses in the Central Galaxy. Only the Central Auction House remains standing here. It is favored by the dignitaries of the four regions.</p>

    <p>The four emperors even brought everything in the imperial palace directly here for auction. This shows how powerful it is.</p>

    <p>"Who is this president? Can you see him?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>This is a question asked instead of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Ying himself is actually very curious.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the views between their master and servant are consistent. They believe that the president of the Central Auction House is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>If he is strong enough, he may even be suspected of arranging this time-travel drama.</p>

    <p>After careful consideration of Wang Ling, he feel that this president is extremely suspicious.</p>

    <p>As the president of the Central Auction House, this person not only has some knowledge of the situation of the Four Emperors in the Eternal Era, but also enjoys a certain network status in the Four Realms.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that he also has all kinds of rare treasures obtained from strange channels.</p>

    <p>Such a person must be very powerful. And judging from what we know so far about Wang Ling, this person is used to operating behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>It is also very consistent with the tone of the director behind the diary.</p>

    <p>"The president and I have only met once. Suddenly I looked back. He was in the shadow of the lamp." During the team's voice skills, Dongda suddenly sighed.</p>

    <p>"Didn't you see his face?"</p>

    <p>"No." Emperor Dongda said: "But through the vague facial outline, the Liu Renwen in front of me is indeed very similar to him. He should be his biological son."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was speechless.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to know who the president was and more detailed information. He didn't ask him whether he was green or not.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that Emperor Dongda's answer should be all he knew about the situation.</p>

    <p>Even the emperor is unclear about the identity of the president, let alone others.</p>

    <p>At this point. Wang Ling fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the bidding on the spot had reached a sky-high price of 500 million mixed spirit stones.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun's lips twitched as he added the price, trying to scare all those who competed with him with such an offer.</p>

    <p>However, he underestimated the cultivators' enthusiasm for the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>Especially within the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>The people sitting here are all powerful people. Faced with such an object, it is impossible to give up easily.</p>

    <p>The same is true even for those who are not sitting in the VIP room. They are all royal families from various regions. Maybe they are not as good as King Tiankun in the circle of powerful people. But they still want to fight for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

    <p>So, in less than ten minutes, the Book of Nine Realms had been raised to an unbelievable price of 700 million mixed spirit stones.</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen, who played Qin Zhong, wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>In fact, he knew very well that as long as the guest in Room Number 1 continued to participate in the bidding, the Book of Nine Realms would definitely fall into the hands of the guest in Room Number 1.</p>

    <p>After all, they had made unilateral commitments before.</p>

    <p>"What if the guest in Room 1 doesn't give up and sends him out directly? Is it really okay?" Chen Yanan asked worriedly.</p>

    <p>While the two were auctioning, they also communicated privately and secretly.</p>

    <p>"Integrity first."</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen replied: "Since it is a promised thing, it must be done. And we are not too much at a loss. Although it took some effort to get this book of nine families, we actually did not spend too many resources to purchase it."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan asked: "How much did it cost to get it?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong answered truthfully: "Including travel expenses and the cost of exploration and excavation, it is about more than 200,000 mixed spiritual stones."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan was shocked: "So cheap?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "Father... has special channels. That's why I got it. It was found from the tomb of a cultivator who failed to reach the ancestral realm."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan: "Why in the tomb?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "Those who get things like this must have selfish motives. Since they can't become a disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang, they naturally don't want others to become a disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang. But the material of the Book of Nine Realms is special. They can't Destroy it. So the person who originally had the Book of Nine Families would naturally choose to take it into the grave and let it be sealed in the ground forever."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan: "How did the president know..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong shrugged: "I don't know. You know, I have never met my father in my life. Basically, I communicate with my father through communication symbols."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, King Tiankun could no longer sit still in the VIP room. He directly kicked open the door of the VIP room. He could no longer remain calm.</p>

    <p>"One billion mixed spirit stones!" He shouted out the price.</p>

    <p>This time, it really shocked many people here.</p>

    <p>Everyone sighed. After all, this was King Tiankun, the representative of the Western Emperor. Even though they were powerful people, they were still inferior to King Tiankun in terms of background.</p>

    <p>Many people are helpless. Although they desperately want to get this Book of Nine Realms, they can only give up in the end.</p>

    <p>According to the rules of the Central Auction House, if you bid randomly and cause trouble, if you don't have enough money to successfully trade, you will be permanently blacklisted.</p>

    <p>There is such a punishment mechanism. Even though many people here are dissatisfied with King Tiankun's proud and indulgent attitude, they have no choice but to put down their hands in participating in the auction.</p>

    <p>But there are still people who haven't given up.</p>

    <p>After many people knew that they could not obtain the Book of the Nine Families, they naturally turned their attention to the guest in Room 1 who competed with King Tiankun. As well as Mrs. Shanxiu, the leader of the Immortal Mountain Sect.</p>

    <p>One billion mixed spirit stones...</p>

    <p>Even King Tiankun felt very painful.</p>

    <p>But the money has to be paid.</p>

    <p>Because he believed that he had the potential to become a true disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>"This friend in Room 1. As the saying goes, a gentleman will not take away someone's love. This book of nine families is something I must get. I hope this friend can give it to me."</p>

    <p>King Tiankun said. His tone was fierce. But it was hard to tell whether it was a request or a threat.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was silent for a moment. He only heard King Tiankun say again, "This way, you withdraw from the bidding and give the things to me. After I read it, if you are sure that you are not destined to Dao Ancestor Wang, you can sell the book of the Jiujia again. You, of course. You don't need to spend the one billion mixed spirit stones from me. You only need to pay 800 million. What do you think?"
    Emperor Dongda was silent for a moment, only to hear the King Tiankun open his mouth again and say; "In this way, you withdraw from the auction and let the things to this king. This king looks at it, if confirmed with Dao Ancestor Wang this king is not destined, it can be that the book of the Jiujia is sold to you again. Of course, you don't need to spend 1 billion mixed spirit stones, you only need to offer 800 million. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>King Tiankun said firmly.</p>

    <p>These words also made everyone in the audience sigh.</p>

    <p>When you hear this plan, you will feel like an old man.</p>

    <p>These days, everyone feels that they have the potential to become a true disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>In this case, how can it be possible to give up the Book of Nine Realms so easily if there is capital support?</p>

    <p>King Tiankun's proposal is full of dangers.</p>

    <p>If this happens, he directly becomes a true disciple. It will not turn the whole world upside down. Maybe he can inherit the position of the new emperor.</p>

    <p>However, if this doesn't work out, I won't be too much of a loser if I sell the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>Simply a genius!</p>

    <p>However, King Tiankun's wishful thinking was still wrong.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda still chose to increase the price: "One billion one hundred million mixed spirit stones."</p>

    <p>King Tiankun's mouth twitched: "You don't need 800 million! You can just pay half of the final transaction price in mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda didn't listen to his nonsense at all: "1.3 billion mixed spirit stones."</p>

    <p>King Tiankun: "Let's do this. Let me see it first. If nothing happens after I read it, I will give it to you directly!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda thought for a moment and then continued to bid: "1.4 billion mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>King Tiankun: "Don't bully others too much!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "One billion Five hundred million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>King Tiankun: "Good boy! Just wait for me!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda chuckled: "One billion Six hundred million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>King Tiankun: "..."</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone in the auction house, including King Tiankun, fell silent.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun didn't even increase the price. Each sentence was increased by an extra 100 million. Even King Tiankun had never seen such a wealthy method.</p>

    <p>In the end, the Book of Nine Realms successfully became the possession of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun had never been so wronged before. He was so angry that his whole body was shaking.</p>

    <p>At this time, the two snake girls standing next to him were also possessing their ears and encouraging him.</p>

    <p>Snake Girl Number 1 said charmingly: "Why do you need to be angry, Your Majesty? We will just grab it later."</p>

    <p>Snake Girl Number 2 echoed: "Yes, Your Majesty. Those who are rich may not necessarily have the strength. Just go up and fight hard. We must not lose this momentum."</p>

    <p>Being so excited by the two snake-like women, King Tiankun, who was so angry that he couldn't care less about it.</p>

    <p>Murderous intent arose in his heart.</p>

    <p>I want to kill all those people in Room 1!</p>
