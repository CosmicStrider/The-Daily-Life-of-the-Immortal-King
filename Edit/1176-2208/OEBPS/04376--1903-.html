  <h1>Chapter 1903: Living in a foreign land. Watching for eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yan? was captured. Jingze was severely injured at the same time. He vomited dragon blood like a dying dog in the water. He completely lost the majesty of being a dragonborn.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming opened his back and took a lot of dragon's spine blood from his back. This made Jingze feel extremely painful. He kept screaming in pain on the spot.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Jingze was completely defeated. And it all seemed to be a foregone conclusion.</p>

    <p>"Wang Muyu...what is your family name? Only you know best..." He spoke hard, completely ignoring Leng Ming's torture, and spoke with a weak breath.</p>

    <p>Those eyes looked at Wang Muyu, giving Wang Muyu an indelible spiritual impact in a short moment: "Look at how these human cultivators treat our dragon clan... You should not help them. Accepting a thief as a father..."</p>

    <p>"You say too many words!"</p>

    <p>Leng Ming raised his hand and punched Jingze on the back. The ground immediately collapsed, creating a huge hole. The dust on all sides was raised. The huge impact directly shook the core world to the point of almost collapse.</p>

    <p>The stability of the core world's structure is closely related to the owner's own condition. If the body or mind collapses, the core world will also collapse.</p>

    <p>It's unimaginable. Wang Nuan and Leng Ming, master and servant, join forces to cause havoc in other people's core worlds, as if they are the masters of this core world.</p>

    <p>The next second, the scene of the world falling apart changed. Wang Muyu noticed that all of them had evacuated from the core world of Jingze.</p>

    <p>The surrounding scene returned to normal. But Jingze also disappeared along with the disappearing core world.</p>

    <p>"Eh. Did he run away?" Leng Ming had actually been wary of Jingze escaping, so he kept an eye on Jingze's movements. But he didn't expect that the other party would escape so smoothly.</p>

    <p>Obviously, there must be help from Bai Zhe and Fenmu Shen behind this.</p>

    <p>Having experienced several previous failures, both of them are undoubtedly "victims" who have been beaten mercilessly by Wang Ling. Since they are victims, they must know how to escape and survive when they cannot be beaten.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming couldn't see what kind of methods the other party used. He felt a little annoyed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl had a calm look on her face. She lay on Leng Ming's back. She stretched out her soft hands to stroke Leng Ming's fluffy green hair. At the same time, she pinched his cute elf ears with one hand to show comfort.</p>

    <p>In their original plan, they did not intend to directly kill Jingze. And this script was also arranged by Wang Ling from the beginning.</p>

    <p>As a younger sister, Wang Nuan doesn't know what Wang Ling is planning. But she will definitely support her brother's work fully.</p>

    <p>After obediently accepting Wang Nuan's comfort, Leng Ming's mood calmed down a lot. Then he carried Wang Nuan on his back and walked to Wang Muyu: "Well. Is your body okay?"</p>

    <p>"It's okay... Aunt Nuan is too strong. She fed me a lot of pills..." To be honest. Until now, Wang Muyu felt the blood surge in his body. Not only was his injury about to recover, but he even felt that he was stronger than before. On the verge of breaking through at any time.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming obviously felt this. He hurriedly asked: "To break through, you need to find a good place. Do you want to go to the Mountain of Retrospection? It is a place similar to the Secret Realm of Time that the sword master arranged before. In it, you can speed up your cultivation and connect with the world. Isolated. And that area is now protected by the Sword King Realm. Where you are, the entire Sword King Realm will protect you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu thought for a while. Then he patted the ashes on his body and stood up from the ground: "Then there is Brother Lao Leng Ming!"</p>

    <p>He had no reason to refuse such an invitation. And it was obvious that this was what Wang Ling meant.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu felt that as a son, he had no reason not to listen to his old father.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. On the other side.</p>

    <p>In front of the Peng family's headquarters, Emperor Dongda, who had his eyes tightly closed, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>Being in a foreign land. Watching the eternity.</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ling does.</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling is trapped in a different timeline at the moment.</p>

    <p>But he could still understand what he cared about. The situation at Wang's villa and Wang Muyu's side had stabilized.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the current overall layout and the overall direction of the script are all within the plot development that Wang Ling has anticipated.</p>

    <p>And all of this was planned by Wang Ling a long time ago.</p>

    <p>It's just that there was an episode of being "trapped" for eternity, which forced Wang Ling to make some changes based on the original plan.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, everything that happens now is within the plan and layout. It goes very smoothly.</p>

    <p>He just want Sun Rong to be able to see the Miss Peng family in front of him with peace of mind.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong disguised herself as a man. She had already passed two levels of discussion and talent show. Her beautiful swordsmanship made everyone at the scene fascinated.</p>

    <p>It was a sword technique that had never been seen before in the ages. It was an eye-opener for everyone. There was no need for Sun Rong to think of moves on her own. In the state of human and sword integration, Aohai led Sun Rong to complete it. This gorgeous sword dance performance is like Aohai leading Sun Rong to complete a spiritual sword waltz that no one else can see.</p>

    <p>Even the butler of the Peng family's headquarters, who had always been domineering, was shocked. Such a figure and such swordsmanship were definitely not something that an ordinary rich man could use.</p>

    <p>In addition, the previous gift was a Dao Ancestor Pill. And he was unable to investigate the origin of Sun Rong despite all possible means. This made him even more curious about Sun Rong's identity.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Wang Rongxia is indeed an extraordinary person. It seems that today's door-to-door blind date should be a big deal. He will be the first person to see the lady." The manager of the Peng family guessed. After all, he is short-handed. Now he also started to speak for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It's just that the final result is still difficult to predict at present. After all, this blind date was originally decided by the eldest daughter of the Peng family. The eldest daughter of their family has a weird temper. Even if they pass all the hurdles, it is still possible in the end. Brush down.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations to Mr. Wang Rongxia for passing the second level. The next level is martial arts! In this level, the lady will personally test Mr. Wang."</p>

    <p>After the results of the second level were tallied up, the manager of the Peng family announced on his behalf. There were cheers from everyone at the scene and those watching on the street.</p>

    <p>They are just people who join in the fun. They think that Sun Rong's move will provide them with an excellent template for interviewing their new son-in-law in the future.</p>

    <p>In the courtyard of the Peng family's headquarters, Wang Ling and others were accompanying them. At the same time, they had the opportunity to observe the scene up close.</p>

    <p>After the Peng Family Headquarters reported the plans for the next level, a beautiful woman wearing a pink and white robe, immortal, graceful and graceful, slowly walked out of the palace...</p>

    <p>Her appearance had a vague sense of déjà vu. It was not entirely the same. He could just detect that feeling from her eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can be confirmed at first glance. This person is Peng Xiren's sister. Peng Beicen is undoubtedly her.</p>

    <p>And he felt as if he had seen it somewhere. It had nothing to do with Peng Xiren, but in the real world. He felt as if he had seen it somewhere.</p>
