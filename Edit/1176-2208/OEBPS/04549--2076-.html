  <h1>Chapter 2076 Party A moved the world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Everyone was surprised that they could choose to take action at this time to protect Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>Even if this person's strength is not as strong as the Sword Master at this time, he must still be a big shot in the cultivation circle on earth today.</p>

    <p>After all, those great powers hidden in various cultivation countries may not be able to achieve the same level as Yi Jianchuan at this moment.</p>

    <p>Therefore, everyone judged in their minds that this person must at least be on the same level as Yuan Zun. Only then can he be worthy of talking to the sword master who has reached the top of the holy realm.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations to the Sword Master for reaching the top of the Holy Realm."</p>

    <p>This is a Mandarin sentence with a strong foreign accent. It is not standard, but it can be understood.</p>

    <p>The disembodied voice sounded from the void. It was encrypted and hazy. No one who has not reached the peak of the ninth level of True Immortal can hear the content of the conversation.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui can hear it. He is the Eternal One. His realm should not be the same as that of the monks on earth.</p>

    <p>At the scene, besides him, Zhang Zhui judged that there were several people who could hear.</p>

    <p>One is Wang Muyu. This kid is a god-level dragonborn. Although he is here to pretend to be a disciple. He looks innocent... I have to say, this acting is really good. Just look at this "cute" Zhang Zhui himself felt like he was about to be deceived.</p>

    <p>In addition, there are two living brothers, Ouyang Fenkun and Ouyang Miokun, who are approaching their end. Unfortunately, they have passed out, so they can't hear anything now.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at this scene, apart from the two mentioned above, there are two others who can still hear this voice.</p>

    <p>One is Hong Siqi from the Venerated Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>As for the other one, Zhang Zhui judged that it was Yue Lingwei who was standing beside him now.</p>

    <p>He had felt that this person's identity was unusual. And there was a familiar feeling all over his body.</p>

    <p>"Is this voice like Mixiu Country Yuan Zun?" Zhang Zhui asked quietly in his ear.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei was not a fool. Naturally, he understood what Zhang Zhui meant.</p>

    <p>Still testing him.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei felt that this was too tiring. Moreover, Zhang Zhui was too suspicious. Although people like this have always been cautious and careful, bad things could easily happen if things continued like this.</p>

    <p>Therefore, while the two Ouyang brothers were unconscious, Yue Lingwei was determined to have a showdown with Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>He sighed: "I can hear you. You don't have to test me. Mr. Eternal Thief."</p>

    <p>"Who are you? Are you also the Eternal One?" Zhang Zhui was not surprised that Yue Lingwei could reveal his identity. After all, they are all cultivators who transcend the earth.</p>

    <p>"Yue Lingwei. How about you remove the word in the middle of this name and put it together again?" Yue Lingwei said calmly.</p>

    <p>"This...haha. That's it!"</p>

    <p>In an instant, Zhang Zhui suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>This month's spirit is Wei. If you remove this spirit, it's Yue and Wei. When combined together, it's the word "crispy" for Ling Zhenren's favorite dry noodles.</p>

    <p>No wonder this man has a familiar feeling all over his body. But his casual, ancient appearance, like that of a Taoist priest, makes people feel a little dazed.</p>

    <p>"So you are Ling Zhenren's real clone?" Zhang Zhui asked cautiously.</p>

    <p>He knows. Currently Wang Ling already has a real clone. It is Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>But Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is performing other tasks. So it is impossible to get here.</p>

    <p>"no."</p>

    <p>However, Yue Lingwei directly denied Zhang Zhui's speculation. He did not intend to hide it and said directly: "I am the real clone of Crispy Noodles Dao Lord."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui's mouth twitched: "In other words, you are the real clone, the real clone..."</p>

    <p>Ah, my dear... you are putting a matryoshka doll here!</p>

    <p>Originally, the real clone only had part of the strength of the original body.</p>

    <p>Now the real clone has spawned a real clone. As a result, the combat power is at least in the Dao Ancestor realm or even higher... This is outrageous!</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Wang Ling is an out-and-out monster.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't help but get goosebumps just thinking about it.</p>

    <p>How strong does this have to be?</p>

    <p>Ancestor Immortal?</p>

    <p>In this universe, has anyone really reached the state of Ancestor Immortal?</p>

    <p>And Zhang Zhui even felt that treating Wang Ling. He must not limit his imagination with the currently known realm system.</p>

    <p>Maybe there is a stronger realm than Ancestor Immortal...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Now he couldn't bear to think about it anymore.</p>

    <p>"You're here to spy on me?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>"It's more than enough to search for Maiko Assi with the combat power of my predecessor. Naturally, I have other things to do when I come here."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei said: "Senior should know that our real clones are separated from the main body. Although they are restrained by the main body, as long as the main body has a thought, we will disintegrate. But the real clone is not as fragile as other clones. If injured, it will turn into powder and disappear. It will even act according to the will of the original body."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know this."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "Real clones have their own independent thoughts. Your souls are also independent. So you are here. After all, it still means...Crispy Noodles Dao Lord."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei smiled dangerously: "The one in the sea restricted area is very dangerous. Bai Zhe's subordinate is the strongest dragonborn. He is not at ease. So he sent me to take a look. After entering the sea restricted area, please let Senior Ziqi and I go our separate ways." Our colleagues may attract attention."</p>

    <p>"I see. I understand."</p>

    <p>After knowing the purpose of Yue Ling's endangerment, Zhang Zhui nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>The two of them had a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>After the showdown, they stopped communicating and just watched the scene in front of them quietly.</p>

    <p>In front of you.</p>

    <p>The ethereal conversation continued. Facing the Holy Sword of the Sea that was condensed by Yi Jianchuan's gathering of Sage Immortal realms, Mixiu Country Yuan Zun forced his intervention. This actually surprised both Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that a person of this level would not show up randomly on earth.</p>

    <p>But it finally showed up.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Yuan Zun's words of joy are serious. Your level is not low."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan smiled.</p>

    <p>He is the number one figure in the Cultivation Country. Especially the Cultivation Country whose combined combat power and modern cultivation science is so strong that it ranks among the top five in the world. How could the Yuan Zun of this country only have True Immortal as rumored?</p>

    <p>A lot of information is hidden.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu didn't speak during the whole process, he could hear Yi Jianchuan's voice, so he understood what it meant.</p>

    <p>It's no secret that cultivating countries hide things from each other.</p>

    <p>His teacher has now reached the top of the Holy Realm. This is open to the whole world. But this does not necessarily mean that there are no Holy Realm masters in other cultivation countries to protect him.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master, can you please let Hong Siqi go for my sake?" Mi XiuYuan Zun said.</p>

    <p>"He led the crowd in public and tried to kill me. This was a provocation. I need a reason not to kill." The sword master stood with his hands behind his back. The sword light bloomed all over his body, like the sun.</p>

    <p>"Besides, I'm very curious. Master Mi Xiuyuan came out to protect him today. Could it be that you are Party A?"</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the voice in the void suddenly laughed. At the same time, there was a bit of helplessness in the laughter: "It's Party A. But the assassination of the sword master was not done by me. I am responsible for lending. Party A."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan nodded.</p>

    <p>He understood instantly.</p>

    <p>This is the creditor's guarantor...</p>
