  <h1>Chapter 1602 A twists and turns ending</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Two more meteorites fell from the sky.</p>

    <p>This trick of "falling stars" was a common technique used by Li Xian when he traveled around the universe. He has become very good at it.</p>

    <p>Li Xian's highest record is to summon 30,000 meteorites with a diameter of 60 meters to land at the same time.</p>

    <p>But that was a long time ago.</p>

    <p>At that time, Li Xian was still making a final stand against Dao Ancestor Wang to avoid being included in the Corpse Map by Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>And the current facts have also proved that such resistance is completely useless.</p>

    <p>Li Xian has used tricks like controlling meteorites to fall to the ground many times. To him, these destructive meteorites are just playthings that can be summoned and then gone.</p>

    <p>He is the eternal strong man.</p>

    <p>With this level of strength, it is certainly difficult for ordinary earth monks to understand.</p>

    <p>But for ordinary earth cultivators like Duyan, the situation before them is undoubtedly a devastating blow.</p>

    <p>Li Xian is too strong.</p>

    <p>Powerful beyond expectation.</p>

    <p>Just standing here without showing any breath, Duyan could feel a sense of panic coming from his heart.</p>

    <p>Although his hand had already grasped the katana, he found that he could not move.</p>

    <p>The fear in his heart had completely plunged him into defeat.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian walked over without saying a word. He just stood in front of Duyan without doing anything. Duyan and the surrounding ninjas in black fell to their knees with weak legs.</p>

    <p>Their whole bodies froze.</p>

    <p>The terrifying aura emanating from Li Xian's body made their blood freeze and they were unable to move.</p>

    <p>Duyan was horrified.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Li Xian drew out the samurai sword from his waist, took a throwing stance and threw it forward!</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>This ordinary samurai sword was covered with a golden coating of light when Li Xian threw it. A film of golden light was attached to it. It strung the two meteorites that were about to fall on the Earth's surface together like beef meatballs. They were carried away from the earth's surface.</p>

    <p>And then. There was a big bang in space.</p>

    <p>"Have you experienced the feeling of death?" At that moment. Li Xian removes the sheath of the katana from Duyan's frozen hand. With a light touch of his fingertips. The sheath, made of spirit iron, instantly turned into powder.</p>

    <p>The difference in strength is obvious.</p>

    <p>Even though Li Xian didn't release even a breath, Duyan already knew at this moment that the person standing in front of him was someone who could crush him to death like an ant at any time.</p>

    <p>He had no intention of killing Duyan in the first place.</p>

    <p>This is no nonsense...</p>

    <p>Murder is illegal.</p>

    <p>As a role model among the eternal strong men, Li Xian must still be a good citizen who abides by laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was actually a deeper reason why he didn't kill Duyan.</p>

    <p>"It's all over." At this time, it was getting late. Li Xian looked up at the stars.</p>

    <p>He waved his sleeves.</p>

    <p>A wave of energy immediately spread out with him as the center.</p>

    <p>Duyan only felt a strong pain in his head that disappeared in a flash. Along with the severe pain, Duyan spurted out a large mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>He knew that all the restrictions he had placed at Jiugong's house were lifted in an instant.</p>

    <p>Soon, the head of the Jiugong family who was restrained and unable to move, that is, Jiugong Liangzi's father, arrived from outside the courtyard occupied by Duyan with a large group of people.</p>

    <p>"You... you blind white-eyed wolf! Shichun trusted you so much before he left! You actually did such a thing!" Jiugong Akagi, the head of the Jiugong family, shouted sharply.</p>

    <p>Duyan just lowered his head.</p>

    <p>He seemed to know that his situation was over. There was no argument at all.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Xiushi's eyes suddenly widened at this scene. He seemed to have thought of something and seemed particularly surprised.</p>

    <p>"Xiushi. Are you okay?" Jiugong Akagi saw Jiugong Xiushi's pale expression. He couldn't help but stepped forward and asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"I'm fine. Father..." Jiugong Xiushi said softly.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare to look directly into the corner of his father's eyes, because just a few hours ago, he was still here making plans. He planned to kill his half-sister...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Shichun would entrust you to such a person with evil intentions!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Akagi hugged Jiugong Xiushi tightly.</p>

    <p>The safety of his son made him relieved a lot. Then he became furious and raised his hand fiercely: "Come here! Get this Duyan dragon! Send it to the police!"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Everyone under his command rushed forward.</p>

    <p>They put something like a soul-binding device on Duyan, which limited his power. They tied up Duyan and all his black-clad ninjas, and then escorted them away together.</p>

    <p>During the whole process, Duyan and the black-clothed ninjas who were trying to have breakfast were silent. The scene was eerily quiet for a while.</p>

    <p>After regaining consciousness, Jiugong Akagi just bowed and thanked Li Xian: "Thank you so much for your help, sir! If it hadn't been for your help, my Jiugong family would have fallen into the hands of these rebellious officials and traitors tonight."</p>

    <p>He accurately found Li Xian. In fact, it was Li Xian who used spiritual power to transmit the events that just happened to Jiugong Akagi's mind.</p>

    <p>Summon meteorites to instantly lift restrictions...</p>

    <p>Such a big boss came specially to visit. Of course Jiugong Akagi had to give face!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Li Xian saved Jiugong Xiushi... For Jiugong Akagi, this is a debt of gratitude that cannot be repaid!</p>

    <p>"But you and I are strangers to each other... Why did you help me?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Akagi was eager to know Li Xian's true identity.</p>

    <p>He knew that the so-called "enthusiastic citizens" were just excuses.</p>

    <p>Looking at Jiugong Akagi's eyes full of curiosity, Li Xian sighed slightly.</p>

    <p>He cannot directly say that his master is Wang Ling. But he can mention something else.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I am from Gray Cult." So, Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>"Gray Cult?" Jiugong Akagi frowned.</p>

    <p>He felt that this teaching seemed a bit familiar...</p>

    <p>Previously, within Jiudaohe, the shareholders of foreign-funded enterprises and Ueki Kimisan from the Academic Affairs Office seemed to have some criticisms of this student literary exchange organization.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Akagi didn't care at first. But until now, he finally knew the weight of this Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>A student organization... actually has such a big boss hiding. And the other party clearly claims that he is from Gray Cult... which proves that Li Xian is of this level and is not the leader of Gray Cult...</p>

    <p>So here comes the question. Who is the leader of Gray Cult?</p>

    <p>Even Jiugong Akagi was a little curious now.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After cleaning up Duyan's group, Jiugong Akagi very enthusiastically invited Li Xian to attend the surprise banquet in the evening.</p>

    <p>Mainly for the sake of my eldest son Jiugong Xiushi and other children who were frightened by this turmoil.</p>

    <p>After this incident, the internal disputes in the Jiugong family will subside for a while. Jiugong Xiushi was originally the biggest leader, but now he has been taught a lesson. Even if the others have ideas, they may not have the courage to take action in the short term.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi, who is still in Huaxiu, has become the biggest winner.</p>

    <p>After three rounds of drinking.</p>

    <p>Li Xian came to the balcony, lit a cigarette and held it in his mouth.</p>

    <p>Smoking.</p>

    <p>This is something he just learned.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi was sitting in a wheelchair, looking at the moon, without saying a word for a long time.</p>

    <p>After the time of a cigarette.</p>

    <p>He slowly lowered his head: "Mr. Li Xian, didn't you? You already knew..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi knows. Li Xian is not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi has never understood why Duyan suddenly betrayed him. He is obviously such a loyal person.</p>

    <p>However, when Duyan and the group of black-clad ninjas were detained and everyone was taken away so quietly, Jiugong Xiushi understood instantly.</p>

    <p>"Because only in this way can he protect you." Li Xian said leisurely.</p>

    <p>Duyan's intention.</p>

    <p>In fact, he already knew it when he stepped into the yard.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of this that Li Xian did not kill him. Not only from the perspective of modern law...</p>

    <p>In essence, Duyan is still a kind and compassionate person.</p>

    <p>He did not live up to his promise to the eldest wife of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Still trying his best to protect Jiugong Xiushi's thoughtfulness.</p>
