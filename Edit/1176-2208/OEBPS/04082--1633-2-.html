  <h1>Chapter 1633 Young people don't respect martial ethics</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Very powerful breath.</p>

    <p>At the moment when Wang Ying's palm came down, cold sweat started to fall from Liu Renfeng's forehead.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..." The intelligence section chief behind him was startled. Wang Ying appeared too suddenly, like a ghost. He had the idea of counterattack in his heart. He wanted to protect Liu Renfeng. However, his body was frozen.</p>

    <p>This was not a restraining spell that Wang Ying used. It was a tremor originating from the depths of his soul. The huge gap in combat power caused Hang Chuan to feel as if his blood had coagulated in this brief moment.</p>

    <p>Then, his body began to tremble and he gradually stopped thinking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying didn't even bother to pay attention to this little guy. He only wanted to take revenge on Liu Renfeng. He pinched her shoulders like a chicken: "Old woman, how do you want to die?"</p>

    <p>"How did you get in..." Liu Renfeng turned pale.</p>

    <p>She had the highest authority in the restricted area of the laboratory. There were barriers everywhere. Ordinary cultivators could not enter, whether through walls, shrinking, or teleporting. Wang Ying's sudden appearance made her feel even more frightened.</p>

    <p>What she didn't know was that there was a link between shadows. Sun Ying'er's body had long been imprinted by Wang Ying. Therefore, Wang Ying knew exactly where she went.</p>

    <p>"How did I get in here? This place. Can't I just come in whenever I want?" Wang Ying grunted.</p>

    <p>There was no unnecessary nonsense. The next moment, he reached out and grabbed Liu Renfeng's head.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng's head was crushed in an instant. It looked like a rotten orange that had burst open.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Master of Shadows. How did you kill her..." At this time, Sun Rong was also sweating coldly. She didn't expect that the battle was over before it even started.</p>

    <p>At this time, no one else in Fengchu's laboratory expected it.</p>

    <p>The allied forces outside haven't encircled yet. Wang Ying would come in at this moment and take out the keystone.</p>

    <p>Young people!</p>

    <p>You really don't care about martial ethics!</p>

    <p>"This old woman. She deserves to die." Wang Ying grunted, "Moreover. This person is very cunning. I didn't kill her. This should be a fake body."</p>

    <p>"Fake person?" Sun Rong was confused.</p>

    <p>"But the realism is indeed not much different from the real body." As he said, Wang Ying stretched out his hand and tore off Liu Renfeng's right leg on the spot.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly covered his eyes. The result was unexpected.</p>

    <p>After the seemingly violent leg-unloading action, there was no blood splattering out. There was only the sound of various gears falling to the ground.</p>

    <p>The right leg was torn to pieces by Wang Ying. The tubes connected inside were also torn off instantly. Orange mucus dripped from it.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Sun Rong was suspicious.</p>

    <p>"It's an artificial human." Wang Ying said with his chin raised.</p>

    <p>He checked the torn off leg of Liu Renfeng. The number 010 was written on it.</p>

    <p>This was also the first time he saw an artificial human. To be honest. Liu Renfeng Such technical means also shocked Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't reached out and touched the body of Liu Renfeng, he would never have thought that Liu Renfeng was fake.</p>

    <p>Because I can only judge by smell. This Number 010 Liu Renfeng is no different from ordinary humans.</p>

    <p>This is different from the Head of State 001 humanoid combat robot developed by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Combat robots are full of various parts. They are purely mechanical weapons. No matter how lifelike their appearance is, they can still be seen at a glance.</p>

    <p>But Liu Renfeng's artificial human technology has a kind of technical strength that can fool others.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er timidly got up from the operating table. She didn't care about what was happening at all. Instead, she was afraid of Wang Ying...</p>

    <p>The conversation between her and Liu Renfeng just now was actually a means of "killing someone with a borrowed knife."</p>

    <p>Originally, I just wanted to test whether Wang Ying was spying on them.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that after this try, this man actually appeared.</p>

    <p>"Don't...don't hit me...o(Ôπè)o" Sun Ying'er shrank in fear.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying curled up the corners of his lips. He stepped forward and pinched the girl's cheek with one hand: "Ha. I'll settle the score with you later."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he suddenly lowered his head and quickly pressed a kiss on the girl's soft lips.</p>

    <p>After this kiss, Sun Ying'er's mind went blank on the spot.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the person who followed Sun Ying'er was none other than Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She felt as if she had received a shocking blow on her head. Suddenly she felt like she had been hit hard...</p>

    <p>Today's young people are not only ignorant of martial ethics.</p>

    <p>It's not about kissing ethics either!</p>

    <p>After she quickly came to her senses, her cheeks turned red.</p>

    <p>Mainly Sun Ying'er and Wang Ying themselves are very similar to her and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's overbearing kiss made Sun Rong have the illusion that Wang Ling was kissing herself for a brief moment.</p>

    <p>Her cheeks turned red all of a sudden. She felt like a fire was lit on her face. It burned her ears instantly.</p>

    <p>"This Liu Renfeng is fake.</p>

    <p>"And now, our first task is to find out the true identity."</p>

    <p>It was still Wang Ying who broke the silence first.</p>

    <p>He looked at Sun Rong's hot face. He couldn't help but laugh: "Ha. Miss Sun don't think too much. It's better to act than to think. You can't wait. Why don' t you take the initiative yourself? Just go straight to the kiss."</p>

    <p>"Ah this. How can this be done..." Sun Rong's face turned even redder after being told this.</p>

    <p>"Do you need permission from others to like someone?" Wang Ying smiled and said, "Think about it yourself."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Sun Rong had never thought about taking the initiative to kiss Wang Ling. But she felt that the difficulty level was too high.</p>

    <p>Kissing is all about the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>If the atmosphere is in place, it will come naturally.</p>

    <p>If you just pounce on it and chew it casually, you will definitely be labeled as a "slut!"</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong is mainly worried that he will be disliked by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now she finally got closer to Wang Ling. She didn't want her relationship with the boy to become alienated again because of her excessive and unnecessary actions.</p>

    <p>Kiss...</p>

    <p>Especially kissing Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Of course this is what she has been looking forward to.</p>

    <p>But sometimes, what matters is that everything will happen naturally.</p>

    <p>Especially Jin Deng reminded her. What is needed to deal with Wang Ling is patience.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what consequences she would have if she got anxious.</p>

    <p>Such consequences. Sun Rong doesn't even dare to think about it.</p>

    <p>Because she knew that she simply couldn't bear it.</p>

    <p>She liked that person, but she didn't expect that she wouldn't even be able to be friends in the end.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, a piercing alarm suddenly sounded throughout the restricted laboratory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying judged that this was the alarm reaction generated after Number 010 Liu Renfeng was crushed.</p>

    <p>And just 10 seconds after the alarm sounded, all the hidden mechanisms in the entire forbidden laboratory were opened.</p>

    <p>A lot of new Liu Renfeng. were pushed out of the machine capsule...</p>
