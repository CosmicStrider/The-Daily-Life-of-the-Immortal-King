  <h1>Chapter 1410 Sun Rong Boss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Pre-emptive strike.</p>

    <p>This is something Sun Rong didn't expect.</p>

    <p>The conditions of Jian Shen College are not bad because it was established with investment from General Yi.</p>

    <p>Although the school has only been established recently, it is also a well-known key university in the city with strong teaching staff.</p>

    <p>Many rich people have no way of finding a way to get in. Jiang Yingying chose to give up and transfer to Number 60 High School. The purpose is already clear.</p>

    <p>I just came here for Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looks at this list. My mood is actually very complicated.</p>

    <p>It says. This batch of transfer students will all be admitted by next Monday at the latest.</p>

    <p>In other words, when Jiang Yingying will come. Sun Rong has no idea at all.</p>

    <p>So now. Sun Rong only knows a little bit.</p>

    <p>She must. Always be prepared.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying's move can be said to affect the whole body.</p>

    <p>It was also around the time when Number 60 High School was over. Er Ha made a special trip to Wei Zhi's apartment. She wanted to find out about Jiang Yingying from Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>It's not that the Er Ha is too critical, it understands the situation, and Sun Rong has promised to give it a good deal.</p>

    <p>Now that Er Ha has decided to live in the human world, it must consider its future life.</p>

    <p>And life is nothing more than working, finding a partner, getting married and having a son and a half daughter...</p>

    <p>But now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's assets in the human world are limited.</p>

    <p>But now, finding a partner is actually a very real problem.</p>

    <p>For example, between a handsome pauper and an ugly rich man. Most people prefer the material aspect... After all, as long as they have money, no matter how ugly they look, they can still be transformed.</p>

    <p>Besides, Er Ha feels that his human form is not ugly.</p>

    <p>It just lacks certain assets.</p>

    <p>So now, helping Miss Sun "work" and make some groceries is undoubtedly an excellent way to make money.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha came to see Wei Zhi, Gu Shunzhi was still attending Number 60 High School. Only Zhao Qingxian was there to help Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>The fat man Zhao Qingxian has switched back to his original body with Fan Xing. Now he looks much more peaceful. But Er Ha thinks this is probably the calm before the storm.</p>

    <p>You may not know what this guy is thinking...</p>

    <p>I won't give up on Liu Qingyi easily.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the biggest beneficiary of Bai Zhe's "Yang Shuangji" incident is actually Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>This guy was already a useless person. However, due to the body swap incident, his injuries were inadvertently healed.</p>

    <p>"You want to ask about Jiang Yingying?"</p>

    <p>Regarding Er Ha's question, Wei Zhi felt a little surprised.</p>

    <p>He habitually grabbed the brim of his peaked cap and turned it back clockwise, revealing his smooth forehead. Then he handed the showerhead in his hand to Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>They are currently cultivating spiritual plants in a converted greenhouse. These spiritual plants are used to make special fertilizers, which can allow spiritual beasts to grow better.</p>

    <p>After leaving the work in hand to Zhao Qingxian, Wei Zhi led Er Ha to the teahouse next door. He closed the door and turned on the soundproof array.</p>

    <p>Although he felt that Zhao Qingxian would not eavesdrop, Jiang Yingying's problem was more private... Wei Zhi felt that it would be safer to do so.</p>

    <p>"Is this necessary..." Er Ha couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"Why do you suddenly want to ask about Miss Yingying?" Wei Zhi was also curious.</p>

    <p>He poured Er Ha a cup of tea. He wanted to know what Er Ha really thought.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this girl transferring to Number 60 High School right away? I was also entrusted by someone to come and inquire about the situation." Er Ha winked at Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>"It was Miss Sun who asked you to come..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi immediately understood. The purpose of this trip.</p>

    <p>I can only say that he is one of Er Ha's best friends in the human world. Sometimes, for a pair of friends who have a tacit understanding, they can guess what it means with just one look.</p>

    <p>"Then can you say it? If it's not convenient for you to say it, I will think of other ways. I will never force you." Er Ha said. After all, the person asking the question may be the granddaughter of Marshal Jiang, one of the ten generals.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi couldn't say more. Er Ha also understood. "I have opened the sound isolation circle. Of course, I just want to tell you. But what I know is very limited."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi smiled. He took out the photo album under the coffee table. There was a photo of Wei Zhi and a girl who looked somewhat similar to Sun Rong. The girl was holding a big orange spiritual bird. Laughs Very happy: "This is Miss Yingying."</p>

    <p>This is the first time Er Ha has seen a photo of Jiang Yingying. If he hadn't looked carefully, he almost thought it was Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, after careful observation, Er Ha feels that the difference is still obvious.</p>

    <p>First of all, Jiang Yingying has short hair and a mole on the tip of her nose. I don't know if it's because of the shooting. Her skin doesn't look fair either.</p>

    <p>So Er Ha concluded: "The boss is still good-looking."</p>

    <p>"You help boss Sun Rong. Your salary must be high, right?" Wei Zhi gossiped.</p>

    <p>"Not high, not high. It only costs 100,000 yuan to get a piece of information."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I will remember to send you a red envelope when your salary arrives."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed.</p>

    <p>After all, she is the eldest daughter of a wealthy family. The money is so good...</p>

    <p>"Miss Yingying is indeed Uncle Jiang's granddaughter. But she is not biologically related. She was adopted when she was very young," Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"Again adopted?" Er Ha's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>What's wrong with the ten generals...they only like to pick up children and raise them?</p>

    <p>But actually Er Ha is not incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>When cultivators reach advanced levels, there will always be some "ascetic" cultivators. In layman's terms, they have been single for too long and have gotten used to it...</p>

    <p>There is a saying: Being single is fun. Being single is always fun!</p>

    <p>Since he doesn't consider marrying a wife and wants to raise a child to inherit his legacy, then adoption is the most convenient way.</p>

    <p>"Not many people know about this. Uncle Jiang didn't tell anyone. As for how I knew it, it was actually discovered by accident." Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>However, he did not say how he discovered this relationship.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Jiang treats Miss Yingying like his own. Whenever there's a problem with her spirit beasts, they come to me for treatment. She basically sends them to me for treatment. On the whole. Miss Yingying is a quiet girl with an artistic spirit."</p>

    <p>"Literary...Literary girl?"</p>

    <p>"Absolutely." Wei Zhi nodded.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha suddenly had a bold guess in his mind.</p>

    <p>Since this girl Jiang Yingying likes literature...</p>

    <p>So is there another possibility?</p>

    <p>She is not actually attracted to Little Master Ling...</p>

    <p>You know, during the Jiulong Mountain National Physical Martial Arts Competition. When Little Master Ling and Wang Ying were playing with meteorites in the universe. It was Crispy Noodles Dao Lord who stood in for him!</p>

    <p>And while he was still a stand-in, he completed a shocking essay with full marks...</p>
