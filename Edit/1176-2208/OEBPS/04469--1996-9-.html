  <h1>Chapter 1996: Help Jiugong Liangzi to make great contributions</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi never expected that Jiugong Liangzi would become an obstacle on his career path. He knew very well that this was probably the time when the upper management of Huaxiu Alliance asked him to make a choice.</p>

    <p>He was silent. He didn't know where to start talking about this matter. Sun Dakang just sighed silently when he saw this. He patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder and motioned Zhuo Yi to follow him.</p>

    <p>Then the two of them went directly to the top floor of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools building through the teleportation circle inside the office. This is the observatory on the top floor. It can overlook the entire Jinghua City building. It is also an important base for monitoring the fluctuations of the gate to other worlds in the past years.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, this place is closed. Only Sun Dakang comes up from time to time to smoke a cigarette.</p>

    <p>"Want a cigarette?" He took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and looked at Zhuo Yi and asked.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your kindness, leader. But I... don't smoke."</p>

    <p>"This is no longer within the alliance. You can call me teacher. Little Zhuozi." Sun Dakang lit the cigarette and slowly blew out the smoke ring.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Teacher..." Zhuo Yi was respectful and did not dare to slack off at all.</p>

    <p>"Tell me the truth. You should know Jiugong Liangzi's true age, right?" Sun Dakang asked.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi... is an adult. Although she is still in high school. I have asked her. Because the training for the family heir was delayed for two years..."</p>

    <p>"So. You know a lot about her?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, teacher."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. Then he said: "She came to Huaxiu to be an exchange student at Number 60 High School. In fact, she came here for me."</p>

    <p>"Back then, the Jiugong family originally wanted to enter the Huaxiu market. They predicted the movements of the demon king Tuntian Ha in advance. They wanted to take Tuntian Ha first to strengthen the Jiugong family's momentum in the Huaxiu country. But they didn't expect that I would beat them first."</p>

    <p>"Then the Jiugong family began to doubt whether I had the strength to defeat Tuntian Ha, the Demon King back then..."</p>

    <p>"So. They sent Jiugong Liangzi to investigate you."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang curled his lips and nodded: "When you say that, I completely understand. It seems that you have conquered her with your strength. Otherwise, she would not be able to fall in love with an enemy like you."</p>

    <p>"This is the kind of teacher..."</p>

    <p>"This is an emotional story that sounds touching. And I know you, Little Zhuo, are not lying because the logic behind the story is completely reasonable."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang leaned on the bleachers, smoking a cigarette, and said with his back to Zhuo Yi: "But you have to know that Little Zhuo, the teacher believes in you. It does not mean that other people will believe in you... This path is the classics. There is nothing wrong with it. As long as there is one stain, it will be irreversible."</p>

    <p>"Teacher, students know that the background of Jiugong's family is very complicated. Because the capital chain was missing at that time, Jiugong Liangzi's father married a sixth wife. She is the famous Zhai Xing Group on Sun Island."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned. He cupped his fists and said, "But teacher. Now the head of the Jiugong family has found out. The sixth lady also entered the Jiugong family with impure purposes."</p>

    <p>"The current Jiugong family has also entered into business cooperation with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. With funds guaranteed, the current Jiugong family has completely severed ties with the Zhai Xing Group."</p>

    <p>"Their annual charity event..."</p>

    <p>"There is no need to say any more, Little Zhuo. Of course the teacher knows that you are anxious. But in this matter, you must make a decision."</p>

    <p>"Is there no other way? Teacher..." Zhuo Yi gritted his teeth and lowered his head.</p>

    <p>He loves the career he is currently engaged in. He has established his belief in this aspect since he was a child. Influenced by his family education, he has never been confused or hesitant.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, he felt a kind of difficulty.</p>

    <p>Even a little sad.</p>

    <p>Of course Zhuo Yi, he has never doubted his feelings for Jiugong Liangzi. He has never felt that kind of love at first sight in his life.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Zhuo Yi discovered that his feelings for Jiugong Liangzi were even deeper than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Even his faith, which had never been shaken, began to hesitate for a moment.</p>

    <p>"There is no way. It's not impossible."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Dakang sighed and said, "But it's very difficult."</p>

    <p>"Teacher, please tell this student!" Zhuo Yi bowed. After saying this, he was about to kneel down. But he was suddenly helped up by Sun Dakang: "Little Zhuo, what are you doing... Get up quickly."</p>

    <p>This is really emotional. Sun Dakang can also see it. Romance between young people is sometimes like a spark. It suddenly goes off and no one can prevent it.</p>

    <p>After so many years, he has also watched Zhuo Yi grow up.</p>

    <p>The dilemma between career and love also moved Sun Dakang.</p>

    <p>"The only way now is to make Miss Jiugong Liangzi one of our own." Sun Dakang revealed the secret.</p>

    <p>"One of our own? The teacher means..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. Just get the nationality of a legal cultivation resident of our country of Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang said: "But you have to know Little Zhuo. How difficult it is for a cultivator from another cultivating country to obtain the nationality of our country, Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>"First of all, our country of Huaxiu has never recognized dual nationality since its founding. Foreign cultivators must enter our country of Huaxiu and obtain the nationality of Huaxiu... unless they make major and outstanding contributions to our country. Only in this way can they obtain the nationality."</p>

    <p>"This is not a problem that can be solved by just donating money from your family. Do you understand? Little Zhuo..."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang said: "Of course. If Jiugong Liangzi really marries you, as long as she meets a certain number of years, she can also choose to withdraw her original cultivation country nationality and get her own country's ID card. But get it like this If it does, it will take a long time, and the gold content is very low."</p>

    <p>"I understand, teacher..." Zhuo Yi slightly lowered his eyes. He already fully understood the meaning of these words.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, it is simply nonsense to help a person achieve outstanding contributions in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>But now. Zhuo Yi has no other choice...</p>

    <p>These days, since the last time Er Ha visited the demon world, even the demon world has begun to behave... This is an era where there are no monsters to fight. Although he doesn't know if there will be new conflicts between the human world and the demon world in the future. At least under the control of the second-generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue, there will be a long honeymoon period between humans and the demon world during this period.</p>

    <p>So. Is there any other way that Liangzi can make meritorious deeds?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi even had a crazy idea flashing through his mind...</p>

    <p>He remembered that Bai Zhe was cultivating dragon descendants, and those dragon descendants themselves were considered a major threat to the earth.</p>

    <p>How about letting Jiugong Liangzi kill those dragonborn?</p>

    <p>No matter what, let Liangzi take down that saint?</p>

    <p>That's not right. The Saint Tribe has already obediently handed over another Cosmic Embryo to Master. It can be regarded as fulfilling the previous truce promise. If they just fight like this, it seems a bit unkind.</p>

    <p>To be honest. Zhuo Yi's mind is a little messy.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he can still ask Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Maybe his own master might have some ideas...</p>
