  <h1>Chapter 1531 Peng Xiren's road to death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Not long after the girl left, Ma Jiao gradually came to her senses.</p>

    <p>She opened the door panel on her body.</p>

    <p>A refreshing and gentle spiritual power instantly surged into Ma Jiao's heart.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>Everything was as she expected. The Jiugong Liangzi in front of her was the fake Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Although she didn't know what happened to the iron gate that suddenly came from the sky.</p>

    <p>But Ma Jiao was still surprised by Sun Rong's choice.</p>

    <p>Ever since she was taken advantage of by Akano Sekitora, a ruthless man, she often felt that she was in a state of mental separation... and she also knew that sometimes her mentality would change suddenly and become very abnormal.</p>

    <p>Because of her fusion with ghosts, she began to become cold, cold-blooded and even dark...</p>

    <p>She will choose to deal with those unclean things under her eyes without mercy.</p>

    <p>But now, Aohai's healing sword energy has restored Ma Jiao's mental state to an unprecedented calmness.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the original thought of trying to expose Sun Rong as Jiugong Liangzi disappeared.</p>

    <p>She wasn't sure what was wrong with her.</p>

    <p>I just feel that my whole person has become warmer.</p>

    <p>He knew clearly that his identity would be revealed by doing so, but he still chose to use the healing effect of sword energy to save himself...</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao couldn't help but shed two tears.</p>

    <p>In her memory, she felt like she hadn't cried like that for a long time.</p>

    <p>They are tears from the bottom of my heart.</p>

    <p>This is the function of Aohai's healing sword energy. In addition to recovering injuries, it can also stabilize the spirit and purify all evil spirits in the body.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong doesn't know how strong his healing sword energy is.</p>

    <p>Because she just used a little bit of strength.</p>

    <p>But what Sun Rong didn't know was that even a tiny bit of strength was enough to save the broken-winged bird in front of him, who was about to fall into the abyss forever.</p>

    <p>The current Aohai. The Aohai that incorporates the five-core Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Even if it's just this little bit of power.</p>

    <p>How can this evil thing resist her?</p>

    <p>Even a 100% fused ghost can be uprooted by Aohai's power.</p>

    <p>And when the ghost in Ma Jiao's body was released from the body along with a trace of black energy.</p>

    <p>She felt her whole body relaxed.</p>

    <p>It was as if the huge boulder that had been weighing on her had been removed, making her whole body feel happy.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Ma Jiao was deeply moved.</p>

    <p>These years, she has been alone, facing the pain of being forcibly ghosted...</p>

    <p>She never thought about it.</p>

    <p>There was actually a person who became her light at the critical moment, shining into the bottomless abyss deep in her heart. She also completely shattered the world that was swallowed up by darkness...</p>

    <p>When she came to her senses, a figure walked towards her.</p>

    <p>This man was holding a flashlight. He came here through an internal passage known only to the builders of the secret room.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao recognized the identity of the person. There was a look of surprise on her face: "Teacher Zhou?"</p>

    <p>The visitor's name is Zhou Xiang. He is from Huaxiu. He is currently employed as a Chinese teacher at Jiudaohe High School in Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang saw Ma Jiao who was in a state of embarrassment, with mottled blood on the ground. He hurriedly greeted him: "What's going on? They're all injuries...ah! My secret room! This wall. I spent a long time on it." It only took time to paint it!"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. Teacher Zhou..." Ma Jiao apologized. The expression on her face was very remorseful.</p>

    <p>Such a reaction undoubtedly stunned Zhou Xiang.</p>

    <p>In his impression, Ma Jiao was not the one to take this route...</p>

    <p>And then. Ma Jiao suddenly raised her head. Blinking her eyes. Slightly pleading, she looked at the young man in front of her: "This matter. Can you please, Teacher Zhou, help me to keep it a secret?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang was stunned.</p>

    <p>Although I was very angry that my secret room was made into such a mess.</p>

    <p>But who can refuse the female student's request?</p>

    <p>He shrugged helplessly: "Okay. I don't care. But you have to help repair it. We have to hurry up and repair it. There are several groups of testing students behind us."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Ma Jiao nodded: "What should I do?"</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do about the iron door for the time being. Replace it with hardwood board and disposable spray paint to prevent anyone from damaging it again. This is the most cost-effective and quick repair method." Zhou Xiang said.</p>

    <p>"No problem, teacher." Ma Jiao nodded.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Ma Jiao. I have a question..." At this time, Zhou Xiang frowned.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, Teacher Zhou?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang actually wanted to ask Ma Jiao what happened.</p>

    <p>Why does it suddenly seem like a different person...</p>

    <p>But he never said it out loud.</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao smiled at him: "Also, Teacher Zhou, my name is not Ma Jiao. My name is Rokume Akahoko."</p>

    <p>"I'm rude. Classmate Liumu." Zhou Xiang also smiled.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what happened to Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>But at least. The girl in front of me seems much cuter than before.</p>

    <p>Central control room. When Wang Ming saw Zhou Xiang, who was responsible for the repair work, he also showed curiosity: "Little Jiucai. Is this person reliable?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Brother Xiaoer. He has the best temper among the teachers I know. He is also the one with whom I have the best relationship." Jisaki said, "Teacher Zhou Xiang's child is in the same class as us."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Are you also studying in Jiudaohe?"</p>

    <p>"No. Teacher Zhou came here to work for the high salary. The child is studying in Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>"Which school?"</p>

    <p>"Jian Shen College. Zhou Ziyi."</p>

    <p>"Jian Shen College?" Wang Ming is very familiar with this school.</p>

    <p>After all, it was General Yi who established it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Yi Zhiyang, who was psychologically traumatized at the Jiulong Mountain Physical Martial Arts Competition, also studied at Jian Shen Academy.</p>

    <p>It's just the name Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming has indeed never heard of it.</p>

    <p>But I can study at Jian Shen College. I guess this teacher Zhou Xiang's family background is also unusual.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thought thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>Although Jisaki has great trust in this teacher Zhou Xiang.</p>

    <p>However, for the sake of caution, Wang Ming still wrote down the name.</p>

    <p>I plan to find time to dig out more detailed information later.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the star-eating star of the infinite galaxy, Peng Xiren suddenly opened his eyes: "I found him..."</p>

    <p>"What is he doing?" Fenmu Shen asked.</p>

    <p>"A boring secret room game. But it is a good opportunity to erase him silently..." Peng Xiren has already thought of a way to use the secret room to quietly erase Wang Ling in it.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you want to take action in such a hurry? Why don't you just wait and see..." Fenmu Shen suggested.</p>

    <p>I have a vague feeling of bad premonition.</p>

    <p>"I have waited for this moment for too long." Peng Xiren has made up his mind and does not intend to wait any longer.</p>

    <p>In front of those ordinary people, kill this alien monster completely, clean out his heart, and then use the intestines to make a sling to hang it in the secret room...</p>

    <p>Until the end, it was completely exposed to the public eye.</p>

    <p>When I think of Wang Ling's tragic death.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was pleased.</p>

    <p>Things are changing.</p>

    <p>How cruel...Classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The next moment, his figure disappeared in the star-devouring aura.</p>

    <p>A contestant appeared quietly in the secret room.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>I'm here to kill you...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren sneered.</p>
