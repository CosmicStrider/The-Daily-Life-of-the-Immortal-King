  <h1>Chapter 1188 That slap</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The power of {blood coagulation recovery skill} is self-evident. This is Wang Zhen's great capital in the world. It is also a key skill used to measure the strength of the enemy - because he can judge the strength of the opponent based on the amount of blood he vomits. Strong.</p>

    <p>That blow just now. Even if Li Huanran only used less than 20% of his power. Calculating the strength of 10 success power in proportion, it would be much lighter than when Gu Shunzhi hit him. Wang Zhen even thought that maybe his parents Any slap you give yourself will be harder than Li Huanran's.</p>

    <p>However, having said that, Li Huanran, as the son of the famous martial artist Li Xiaokai, although lacking in strength, still has merit in terms of technique.</p>

    <p>But even so, the expression on Wang Zhen's face did not relax at all when facing Li Huanran. He was testing Li Huanran. Li Huanran informed me that he was also testing himself. In a game, the first wave is often the first wave. You can see the difference between them by playing against each other.</p>

    <p>Even though he knew there was a gap between him and himself, Li Huanran's face still showed no signs of fluctuation. This was the most frightening thing.</p>

    <p>Do you still have any hidden skills...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen narrowed his eyes slightly. He saw that the qi on Li Huanran's body was condensing. As an excellent martial artist, he could mix the qi, blood and spiritual energy in the body to stimulate blood circulation and hit the acupoints to achieve a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Is it similar to the Tiangang martial arts? Wang Zhen thought of a move used by the God of War in God's Domain. It is also a spell that intensifies and enhances one's strength by stimulating acupuncture points.</p>

    <p>However, this method of increasing one's combat power by stimulating acupuncture points usually causes great damage to the body...</p>

    <p>"This is {Ji Quan Dao}!" Xiao Yin said at this time. According to the information obtained, Li Huanran used this move to improve himself in order to open the door to the void and find his father. In order to ensure sufficient power, own fighting power.</p>

    <p>"In order to open the Gate of the Void, Li Huanran started the 12th level of Jiquan Doo, which is the highest level. This is why Li Huanran could not be saved even if he successfully opened the Gate of the Void..." Xiao Yin said. The 12th level is the highest level. A level of Jiquan Doo. It impacts the acupoints and meridians all over the body. It brings the energy of huge combat power to the body in a short period of time. It is tantamount to igniting one's own body.</p>

    <p>Every minute and every second will bring huge pain like burning.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Huanran had completed gathering Qi. This process seemed to take a long time but in fact it only took a blink of an eye. Wang Zhen could clearly feel that Li Huanran's Qi had become stronger.</p>

    <p>Three spiritual patterns appeared on his face. This is a sign that {Ji Quan Dao} has been turned on. The spiritual patterns will be displayed directly on his face in this form.</p>

    <p>The three spiritual patterns are the third level of Jiquan Doo... This is not all of Li Huanran's skills, so it is far from life-threatening at present.</p>

    <p>The body will not feel pain until it is at least 10 weights.</p>

    <p>Level 11. The burning sensation will intensify, but it is not the end of the road. But if it lasts for too long, you will die.</p>

    <p>Level 12. This is a situation of full combat power. It cannot be taken back. It can only last for a maximum of 5 minutes. Death is inevitable.</p>

    <p>Did you only open the triple layer...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt that he was still looked down upon. Li Huanran didn't seem to take him completely seriously.</p>

    <p>"Because I still have the power of Shadow, so I can definitely be more confident than me." Wang Zhen laughed at himself. He saw the conceited look in Li Huanran's eyes. It was like the first time he met Wang Ling look in his eyes when they were fighting was full of confidence and even arrogance. However, the biggest reason why cultivation has become the goal pursued by so many people is: unknown.</p>

    <p>The road of cultivation is full of unknowns. This is the important core that makes so many cultivators tirelessly pursue Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>"If you look down on me, something big will happen." Wang Zhen warned Li Huanran. But unfortunately, Li Huanran did not listen to Wang Zhen's words.</p>

    <p>He opened and closed his fists in a fighting posture. Wang Zhen saw countless black shadows pouring in nearby, above Li Huanran's fists.</p>

    <p>"Have you finally used your shadow power?</p>

    <p>"Er Ha saw a huge demonic shadow appearing behind Li Huanran. It looked like a Western demon. It had long pointed palms. This scene made Jiang Yingyue sigh slightly. She had seen the capabilities of the demonic shadow herself. Every subsequent punch that Li Huanran punches will inject the power of the two shadows into the person's heart like a syringe, causing a person's heart to completely lose control.</p>

    <p>If you continue to use melee attacks at this time, you will be completely in Li Huanran's way. However, what is unexpected to Jiang Yingyue is that Wang Zhen's choice is to bite the bullet and fight Li Huanran head-on. !</p>

    <p>"Is he crazy?"</p>

    <p>In Er Ha's internal space, Jiang Yingyue saw what was happening outside through Er Ha's spirit sharing technique.</p>

    <p>Instead of choosing to evade, Wang Zhen bravely charged forward... In Jiang Yingyue's opinion, this was an act of seeking death.</p>

    <p>"The heavy mental suppression of the demonic shadow is no joke!" Jiang Yingyue still felt incredible about Wang Zhen's choice.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, the fists of Li Huanran and Wang Zhen collided. The speed of the two was equally fast. It was so fast that it was dizzying. The flying fist shadows turned into countless big snakes and collided together in an instant.</p>

    <p>The violent collision caused the entire stalactite cave to shake. Countless broken rocks fell from the top of the cave. Each pyramid-shaped stalactite was shattered by the energy generated by the friction between the two as they approached the battle zone. !</p>

    <p>"Already lost..." Jiang Yingyue shook her head repeatedly. With such a frequency of fighting, the two of them exchanged hundreds of punches in one second. And Wang Zhen was also equivalent to having withstood the demon shadow hundreds of times. Shadow injection... This has reached the limit of a normal person. No matter how big a normal person's heart is, it is impossible for him to withstand such huge mental pressure.</p>

    <p>However, a scene that was beyond Jiang Yingyue's expectation finally happened...</p>

    <p>Under Li Huanran's heavy offensive, there was no trace of fear on Wang Zhen's face. He faced Li Huanran's fists one after another. The rhythm was appropriate and his breath was steady. There was no sign of fear.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! No one can maintain such a mentality under the weight of the demonic shadow..." Jiang Yingyue remembered that when she had fought with Li Huanran before, it was only a few dozen punches. There was already in her body I felt a deep sense of guilt and had an urge to die!</p>

    <p>"In fact, it doesn't matter who makes the move. Whether it's Wang Zhen, me or Yin Zhenren next to me, none of the three of us will feel scared." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"Why?" Jiang Yingyue was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Secret." Er Ha let it slip.</p>

    <p>The three of them. Behind them is Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>On power. Who else in this universe is stronger than Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Only those who have fought against Wang Ling know.</p>

    <p>That slap from Ling Zhenren was the biggest psychological shadow.</p>

    <p>In comparison, there are many demons. It's still nothing...</p>
