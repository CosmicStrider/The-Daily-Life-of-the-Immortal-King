  <h1>Chapter 1378 The spoiled Sun Ying'er</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Father Wang called Wang Ling to the study room. It didn't take {his mind}Wang Ling to know that Father Wang was looking for him for composition.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Wang Ling saw Father Wang's computer interface in the study room. It happened to be frozen in the background of the composition review.</p>

    <p>"Did you write this...?" Father Wang stared at Wang Ling. The expression on his face was a bit funny.</p>

    <p>There's no way he wouldn't recognize his son's handwriting.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. It was Father Wang who had been training him since he was a child.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling was able to hold a pen right after he was born. Father Wang has felt that good calligraphy with beautiful hands can affect people's lives.</p>

    <p>And this is actually a way to exercise control of strength.</p>

    <p>At least. In terms of the strength of holding the pen. Now Wang Ling is sure.</p>

    <p>The process of teaching writing is not easy. Looking back now, Father Wang still feels very bitter.</p>

    <p>Those pens that were pinched off by Wang Ling in the process. Even if calculated at 1 yuan each, they could cover his royalties for several years...</p>

    <p>"Xiao Lei sent me a text message earlier, asking me to take care of this composition. In fact, I have seen it a long time ago." Father Wang said with a smile.</p>

    <p>He lit a cigarette and took a deep breath. The nicotine breath turned into smoke dragons and was spit out from Father Wang's mouth and nose.</p>

    <p>Then, the smoke was inhaled into the lungs by Wang Ling, filtered into fresh oxygen, and flowed back into the study.</p>

    <p>Although Father Wang was smoking, the whole study had no smell at all.</p>

    <p>There is no need to worry about PM2.5 in the Wang Family Villa. So there is no need to buy an air purifier.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is ready-made.</p>

    <p>This is the benefit of raising a son.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. We are now discussing with several reviewers. We want to send this essay to the creative library. I voted against it. You should know the reason better than me. After all, I am still your father. I still have to avoid suspicion."</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"I haven't finished what I said." Father Wang said: "Although I voted against it, it's useless. According to the principle of the minority obeying the majority, your essay will still be sent in in the end."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This is the final result of your essay. But I came to talk to you today. It's not just about the essay."</p>

    <p>Father Wang thought for a moment and then raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling with a deep look. There was a hint of meaning in his eyes: "How is your matter with Miss Sun?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling is already sweating.</p>

    <p>"You have even seen big scenes like planet explosions. You are actually nervous about such a thing. As expected of you."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was happy. He put the cigarette butt in the ashtray and twisted it a few times.</p>

    <p>His eyes flashed slightly and his tone was quite free and unrestrained: "We, the boys of the Old Wang family, have never lacked love in our lives. However, we have always been more proactive. There are many active skills in love. In the end, you are all the same. I didn't inherit it. I added all the skill points to passive points."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Your temperament is a bit like your mother's. When we met, your mother was also passive, but not as serious as you. At least I wrote a song and a few poems. In the end, she was moved."</p>

    <p>Father Wang sighed and said: "Unrequited love is always the most tiring. I see that Miss Sun is deeply devoted to you. It is really not easy..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Father Wang paused. He was observing the expression of Wang Ling. When he saw that Wang Ling still looked neither sad nor happy, he said again: "I actually understand you. At this stage, you don't have good control over your power. If you date Miss Sun, you might hurt Miss Sun. In this case, it will be unrealistic to create humans..."</p>

    <p>"..." Hearing this, Wang Ling's eyes finally couldn't help but twitch.</p>

    <p>He felt that Father Wang was getting more and more outrageous!</p>

    <p>"You're kidding." Father Wang laughed. He patted Wang Ling on the shoulder: "Thank you, son."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>"I want to add a wooden supporting character like an emotional idiot in the plot of my next novel. You have provided me with very good material. I have been observing your reaction just now. Not bad! The material was successfully drawn!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang sincerely praised: "It is better to raise a son. He can be an air purifier. He can also be a tool man."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Listen!</p>

    <p>Is this what people say...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Saturday, December 5th.</p>

    <p>Last night, Sun Ying'er was tortured by Wang Ying all night. She felt that her waist was about to collapse.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until six o'clock in the morning that Wang Ying showed mercy and released her back.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong..."</p>

    <p>When Sun Ying'er returned home, she threw herself into Sun Rong's soft arms: "Wang Ying. He bullied me..."</p>

    <p>She looked like she was crying. She seemed to have been greatly wronged. But there were no tears on her face.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong On the contrary, maybe Ying'er... is quite happy?</p>

    <p>"Then I. Send a message to classmate Wang Ling?" Sun Rong asked tentatively.</p>

    <p>"Don't, don't, don't! This is a mess between the two of us. Where can I ask Ling Zhenren to take action? I think it's okay!" Sun Ying'er immediately raised his head.</p>

    <p>"How do I feel? Are you quite happy?" Sun Rong couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>"Who... who is happy! You are being held by a hand and forcibly touching your abdominal muscles. Are you willing? That's great! Wang Ying, he is a pure [beep], natural [beep], super [beep] !"</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel like you didn't say everything you said?"</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. Did you just hear the [beep] sound?"</p>

    <p>"eh..."</p>

    <p>"It's Wang Ying! He set up a keyword blocking spell for me. As long as I say he is [beep], it will become [beep]."</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. He couldn't help but laugh: "I think he's pretty good at Master of Shadows."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was about to cry but had no tears: "He said that this spell will count automatically. He also established a new rule. From now on, punishment will be based on the count. Every time he is blocked, he will receive 50 ball bangs. This Wang Ying [beep]! He is the only one [beep], can come up with such a way!"</p>

    <p>"Stop it. You just said it seven times, it seems..."</p>

    <p>"Isn't that...350 times..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er almost gave up the idea of resisting: "I chopped off the waist and gave it to him!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Actually, there is a reason why I feel so uncomfortable."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er sighed: "Wang Ying, let alone him being arrogant to me. Anyway, no one else saw me in such a mess... But last night, I was hit by him. By a person I saw it! She is still a girl! I also want to save face!"</p>

    <p>"Girl? Which girl?"</p>

    <p>"It's Miss Ajuan! The one who pushed me back with the phone screen protector!"</p>

    <p>"It's her!" Sun Rong also remembered: "But... isn't the location where the Master of Shadows took you to the ball dong deep to the west of the extraterrestrial galaxy... How could Miss Ajuan appear there?"</p>

    <p>"have no idea."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er shook her head. Then she said seriously: "I suspect she is jealous of me. She also wants to touch Wang Ying."</p>

    <p>Hearing the words. Sun Rong slowly issued a "?."</p>

    <p>Has her shadow finally been destroyed...</p>
