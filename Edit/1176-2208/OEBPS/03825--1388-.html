  <h1>Chapter 1388 Sun Rong Killing God</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It would never be possible to exert such sword energy during the normal Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>Old God looked at the girl in front of him warily. She saw the shadow of the sword spirit hidden behind Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The upgraded Aohai. She is wearing a gorgeous dark blue evening dress. Her sapphire-like eyes exude a sense of depth that is thousands of miles under the sea. Her silver-gray hair hangs down. The beautiful curls are like ocean waves.</p>

    <p>Inadvertently, a looming invisible coercion emitted. Mixed with the aura of Sun Rong. Man and sword merged into one. At this moment, there was no distinction between you and me.</p>

    <p>The bond between Aohai and Sun Rong is too deep. This is the spirit sword that Sun Rong has been using since childhood.</p>

    <p>The long-term companionship, coupled with Aohai's gratitude to the sword master after his upgrade, made the bond between the two even deeper, forming a passive version of "the unity of man and sword."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong only needs to pull out the spirit sword. Aohai's breath will automatically merge with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Old God looked at this scene in surprise. At this moment, she finally knew what the problem was: "You actually put one of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes into your spirit sword?"</p>

    <p>This operation scared the Old God out of his wits.</p>

    <p>She knows how precious the "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube" is.</p>

    <p>"What a bold human being!" On the altar, the Old God in the shape of a little girl stood on a high platform. Her figure floated up. She stared down at Sun Rong: "Did you know. Once the Rubik's Cube Imbalance. What are the consequences?"</p>

    <p>The next moment, a brilliant golden halo lit up above her head, releasing the breath of immortality.</p>

    <p>This is the unique ring of Ten Thousand Wing God, which has powerful divine energies.</p>

    <p>After Old God deduced and combined it with the memories in Ajuan's soul, he found out what happened before he was officially resurrected.</p>

    <p>The unspeakable land was destroyed.</p>

    <p>One of the nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes was taken away. This directly caused the other eight Rubik's Cubes to be in a situation out of control at any time.</p>

    <p>And the one given to her by Dao Ancestor Wang back then has fallen out of control!</p>

    <p>No wonder after she recovered, she vaguely felt that something was wrong on Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Everything is explained.</p>

    <p>No wonder Ajuan entered the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube Chamber much earlier than she expected...</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it was because of the imbalance of the Rubik's Cube that something changed. Ajuan brought a human from the Foundation Building stage here to recover the Rubik's Cube!</p>

    <p>This action disrupted the Old God's plan to absorb "Ajuan's Eternal Soul."</p>

    <p>In addition, she could no longer restrain the impulse in her heart.</p>

    <p>So even though we know that the time is much earlier than the estimated time.</p>

    <p>Old God still chose to take action and swallowed Ajuan's soul.</p>

    <p>"We didn't know this would happen. So now we need to collect the Rubik's Cubes one by one and then replace them with new ones." Sun Rong answered.</p>

    <p>"New Rubik's Cube"</p>

    <p>Old God laughed again: "You call me hypocritical. But you are even more hypocritical than me. I don't know how many years it took Dao Ancestor to create a Rubik's Cube. Do you think this Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is made of mud? It can be easily pinched?"</p>

    <p>The next moment!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The surrounding space collapsed. The Ten Thousand Winged God ring above Old God's head burst into bright light!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Er Ha saw the space scene in front of him change instantly!</p>

    <p>When they came back to their senses, they suddenly appeared in a bright world.</p>

    <p>Godly clouds are entrenched under your feet. Runes are flowing. The Old God in the form of a little girl sits in front of you. She is as huge as a mountain. She seems to be an eternal goddess. She exudes a solemn atmosphere.</p>

    <p>If the red dress and black leather shoes weren't too dramatic, this scene would be worthy of everyone's worship.</p>

    <p>"Core World..." Er Ha frowned.</p>

    <p>This is obviously not an ordinary core world, because the energy flowing in it is too huge!</p>

    <p>"Don't think that you are the only one who has the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. The love token given to me by Dao Ancestor. I have already integrated part of its power into my core world."</p>

    <p>Old God spoke. The disembodied voice came from all directions: "You are just a Foundation Building. Even with the spirit sword in your hand, how much waves can you make?"</p>

    <p>The Old God in the form of a little girl couldn't help but laugh. Being dragged into the core world during the battle is a taboo. In the core world, the master of the core world is the god here!</p>

    <p>What's more, she is a god herself!</p>

    <p>"If I point this finger, you will be wiped out. Do you have any last words?" Old God said in a deep voice. She sat cross-legged in this world full of light. Her powerful aura surged.</p>

    <p>This is the first time Sun Rong has faced an opponent that is as big as a mountain. There is a huge difference in size. No matter who you are, you will feel trembling!</p>

    <p>However, she thought that when the gate to another world came, Zhuo Yi faced such a monster king as huge as a mountain...</p>

    <p>Although. Sun Rong now knows that Zhuo Yi is the winner.</p>

    <p>But at that time. Zhuo Yi still rushed forward regardless of his own safety!</p>

    <p>Even though he clearly knew that there was a disparity in power, he still did it without hesitation!</p>

    <p>And this is also the reason why Wang Ling. chose Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Not all weak people can become heroes.</p>

    <p>As long as your heart is strong enough, no matter how weak you are, you are still a hero!</p>

    <p>At this moment.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is full of thoughts.</p>

    <p>The opinions of previous generations. And now... the power given to her by Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>It gave her great confidence at this moment.</p>

    <p>The moment he held Aohai, Sun Rong suddenly felt that there were countless people behind him pushing him forward!</p>

    <p>"It's not certain who will be wiped out!" The next moment, the girl used Aohai's sword energy to rise from the ground.</p>

    <p>Aohai's sword energy turned into two jets under Sun Rong's feet, allowing the girl's figure to fly freely in the air.</p>

    <p>She pointed the edge of Aohai's sword at the huge Old God in front of her. It turned into a brilliant blue meteor. She sprinted forward desperately!</p>

    <p>"You don't overestimate your capabilities." Old God snorted and opened his divine eyes.</p>

    <p>There were two rays of light in the pupils. They shot out like long dragons. They merged in the air and became a huge one. They quickly hit the direction of Sun Rong and exploded with immeasurable divine energy.</p>

    <p>--This is the "infinite divine light" of Old God!</p>

    <p>After merging part of the power of Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. This is equivalent to a blow from Dao God!</p>

    <p>"After all, it's Dao Ancestor Wang's old friend. It's really scary! Sun Rong This sword is so powerful that I'm afraid it's no match for me!" Er Ha was horrified.</p>

    <p>It looked up at the scene from below. At the same time, it assessed the battle situation.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong just jumped up, it had already wrapped part of the power of chaos on Aohai. It wanted to secretly assist Sun Rong in achieving a one-hit kill on the Old God.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that the power of Old God is too strong. His power alone is not enough.</p>

    <p>"No rush." Wang Ying frowned.</p>

    <p>He is here to make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>

    <p>The analysis of combat power is also more accurate.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's blow. Although it cannot kill the Old God with one blow, it can still be done by smashing the infinite divine light and returning the favor to the Old God.</p>

    <p>Because Old God was too trusting and didn't use all his strength.</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Sure enough, everything was as Wang Ying expected.</p>

    <p>The azure blue light transformed by Sun Rong was like a sharp blade. It tore the Old God's boundless divine light into pieces!</p>

    <p>Her speed is extremely fast. She is still moving at high speed. She is shooting towards the Old God!</p>

    <p>Old God couldn't dodge. He was directly scalped by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>I saw that the cross-section was as smooth as a mirror. It could disperse the light...</p>

    <p>(Wang Ling has exceeded 300,000 star points. As agreed, the single wedding dress picture of Sun Rong will be unlocked. It is expected to be released on all platforms in mid-May... (Originally, the deadline for the event was the end of June. Please rush. It's too fast. The artist hasn't finished painting yet))</p>
