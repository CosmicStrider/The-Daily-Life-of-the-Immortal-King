  <h1>Chapter 1566 The Never Impossible Fake Match</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the first round, Wang Ling won the victory effortlessly.</p>

    <p>Mainly because Sakai Kazuya was too harsh on himself. He directly hit the divine spirit with one palm. After causing damage, he held on until the start of the game.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't even move. Sakai Kazuya was bleeding from all seven holes. He fell directly to the ground with a happy face.</p>

    <p>However, this kind of self-mutilation behavior to please Sun Rong is not in Sun Rong's favor.</p>

    <p>After Sakai Kazuya was carried away, Sun Rong immediately differentiated Aohai's sword energy and tracked it to treat Sakai Kazuya.</p>

    <p>"He works so hard. Rongrong, why don't you do me a favor?" Wang Ming said with a smile in the independent spirit chat space.</p>

    <p>"If everyone uses this method, then this shortcut is too easy." Sun Rong also had a helpless look on his face.</p>

    <p>So to sum up the above.</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya. After all, I paid by mistake...</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Office. Ueki Kimisan remotely retrieved the footage of the closed-door match and projected it into the void of the office.</p>

    <p>This is a method of stealing the picture captured by the referee ball into the image magic weapon through certain technical means, and then projecting it.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan hopes that Wang Ling loses. Naturally, everyone is paying attention to Wang Ling's battle.</p>

    <p>"Sakai Kazuya from Kuwada High School lost like this." Holland, the foreign student next to him, looked very sad.</p>

    <p>He has read the paper data about Wang Ling and Alcohol Kazuya. From a data perspective, Sakai Kazuya's attributes are better than Wang Ling in all aspects.</p>

    <p>If even Sakai Kazuya loses, then Holland really can't think of any other possibility besides betraying him.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Sakai Kazuya could do such an amazing job. People in Gray Cult should not be underestimated." Ueki Kimisan was also shocked by Sakai Kazuya's self-injury operation of "weakening himself" before the start of the game.</p>

    <p>For what purpose? To allow Sakai Kazuya to do this...</p>

    <p>This incident puzzled both Ueki Kimisan and Holland.</p>

    <p>"Can you find Houlang Sang's combat power analysis data?" Holland asked.</p>

    <p>"I'm still trying to figure this out."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan said.</p>

    <p>"Now it's just a matter of stealing the screen through the referee's ball. This is already a very dangerous operation."</p>

    <p>"It will take some time to steal combat power data, Mr. Holland."</p>

    <p>"Who will this Houlang Sang face off next?"</p>

    <p>"He's still from Kuwada High School. His name is Akira Yonekura. But please don't worry, Mr. Holland, because this person is the one I arranged."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan laughed sinisterly: "To deal with such a stupid young man, it would be too boring just to let him lose the game. I want him to be ruined..."</p>

    <p>"Akira Yonekura? I seem to have heard this name somewhere."</p>

    <p>"This is a person on the Mixiu Country elite study list that I provided to the Ministry of Foreign Investment earlier. This student intends to go to Mixiu Country for further study. However, his family is relatively poor. He is not eligible to go there."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan said: "So, I offered him a walk in exchange for asking him to deliberately lose the game. In this case, the referee can determine that it was a fake game and eliminate him along with Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Holland nodded: "But such an action is an act that injures the enemy by one thousand and hurts oneself eight hundred. Akito Kurae's reputation will also be affected."</p>

    <p>"Not at all."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan shook his head and said, "When he goes abroad to study. It's a whole new identity. I promised to prepare Akito Kurae with clean materials without any background. Let him start a new life. So. The fake tournament record has no effect on him at all."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Holland breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The preparations this time sounded really thorough. There were no mistakes or omissions.</p>

    <p>After all, the judgment mechanism for fake matches is here. If one person cheats, both parties will be eliminated together.</p>

    <p>As long as they are eliminated together, no matter which side has evil intentions, they will be labeled as dishonest.</p>

    <p>People who eat melon often don't care about the truth of the matter. As long as there is a leading public opinion to lead them to eat melon.</p>

    <p>Then, the habitual thinking of most people will make these people rush to the front like hungry wolves and bite the prey hard without letting go, feasting on it.</p>

    <p>It's so tiring to know the truth. Only happiness is the most important...</p>

    <p>In a sense, Ueki Kimisan is indeed a very cunning opponent.</p>

    <p>His vision is very unique. Spotting Wang Ling is the key to everything.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling can be brought down. What Gray Cult, what support. Everything is a crushing defeat.</p>

    <p>No matter what achievements you have had before, or how many people like you, as long as you do one thing wrong, and then it will be magnified under the influence of public opinion... it doesn't matter even if you are God.</p>

    <p>Because that's the reality.</p>

    <p>But what Holland and Ueki Kimisan didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>Their seemingly seamless match-fixing plan has one very important key.</p>

    <p>That is.</p>

    <p>The referee's ball determines the initial combat effectiveness of Wang Ling. It must be lower than that of Yonekura Weiaki...</p>

    <p>They don't know.</p>

    <p>This is a fake match that will never be possible.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the cadre apartment of Huaxiu Guosonghai City. With the help of Zhou Ziyi, Zhuo Yi gorgeously completed a table of delicious home-cooked meals.</p>

    <p>While eating, Zhuo Yi turned the TV to a specific satellite channel. The picture on the TV was exactly the live broadcast of Wang Ling's closed-door match.</p>

    <p>This picture was projected after Wang Ming's brainwaves were radiated to the Office of Strategic Deception satellite in space.</p>

    <p>A password is required to enter the channel.</p>

    <p>Therefore, only a few core members of the Office of Strategic Deception know how to enter.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this classmate Wang Ling..." Jiugong Liangzi frowned.</p>

    <p>The moment she saw Wang Ling, she suddenly felt that the boy's face seemed familiar.</p>

    <p>And she didn't know why. She suddenly felt that Zhuo Yi seemed to be paying special attention to Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>Judging from a woman's intuition, she feels that the relationship between Wang Ling and Zhuo Yi is not simply a relationship between a senior and a junior.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong told her before that Wang Xiaoer and Wang Ling were secretly accepted disciples by Zhuo Yi. But Jiugong Liangzi still felt that... Zhuo Yi looked at Wang Ling There's something wrong with his eyes.</p>

    <p>How can any master look at his disciple with an admiring face?</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi's look is just like the look Zhou Ziyi looks at Zhuo Yi now...</p>

    <p>So. Why is this happening?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi began to feel a little confused.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, is this a competition?" Jiugong Liangzi asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes."Zhuo Yi nodded: "As my disciple. As a master, of course I have to care about you."</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiAfter saying this, Jiugong Liangzi fell into silence again. She took a bite of the sweet and sour pork ribs. She didn't know why the ribs today felt particularly sour.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhou Ziyi felt a little uncomfortable when he heard that Wang Ling was the disciple of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Turn out to be...</p>

    <p>Brother Zhuo already has a disciple.</p>

    <p>Hey. It's also... for a person as good as Brother Zhuo. It's not normal to have two disciples.</p>

    <p>He quickly adjusted his mentality. Zhou Ziyi's eyes quickly returned to normal. He stared at the pictures on the TV.</p>

    <p>I wanted to study the charm of Wang Ling so that he could be chosen as a disciple by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>And just when he turned his eyes away, the crisp sound of applause on the TV started to sound.</p>

    <p>Because at this very moment, Akito Kurae, who is having a second round duel with Wang Ling, is slapping himself for some unknown reason...</p>
