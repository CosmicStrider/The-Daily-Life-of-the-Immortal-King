  <h1>Chapter 1204: Combination of Man and Sword 1</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The result of the duel on the field is still a mystery. Sun Rong made some analysis of the situation.</p>

    <p>As every practitioner of martial arts continues to practice for many years, the cells in the body will also evolve as the muscles and veins are dredged and the acupuncture points are activated. These evolved cells are also called "power cells."</p>

    <p>There are 80 trillion cells in the adult body. And those masters who have been practicing the latest martial arts for many years will have a greater proportion of power cells in the body after continuous development.</p>

    <p>For example, at the level of Master Li Xiaokai, power cells account for at least half of the bodies of such masters! There are at least 40 trillion of them! These power cells can perform the work of all other cells and have powerful regulating and cleaning abilities. They can Kills all bad cells in the body.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao touched his double chin: "So, classmate Sun Rong, what you mean is that Han Yun's chaotic rain flow just activated Chen Chao's acupuncture points, thereby stimulating Chen Chao's body to transform more power. cells?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Sun Rong nodded and said.</p>

    <p>However, these power cells are only temporary. As long as they are cells, they will continue to die and replace with the metabolism of the body. Even strong power cells are no exception. Therefore, in order to maintain the number of power cells in the body all year round, martial arts masters will not weaken. Every day A lot of training is done repeatedly every day.</p>

    <p>That kind of bitterness is not something ordinary people can endure.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao has practiced spiritual practice since he was a child. He also has certain power cells in his body.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Zhu Hanyun, who possesses the "Titan Technique", is completely opposite to Chen Chao. To put it bluntly, the Titan Technique itself is a skill that relies heavily on spiritual power. Through spiritual power, it can stimulate the meridians and acupoints in the body, achieving a similar activation of "power cells" The disadvantage is that once the spiritual power disappears, the whole person will be as brittle as a piece of paper.</p>

    <p>On this side, Chen Chao seized the opportunity. He had just activated his power cells. Facing Zhu Hanyun, whose spiritual power had not yet fully recovered, he stepped forward and gave him a meal of Ola Ola.</p>

    <p>Zhu Han Yun's charging time was too long. In the state where {Titan Skill} was not reactivated, his defense was greatly weakened.</p>

    <p>Finally, he was overwhelmed and the golden protective amulet on his body lit up.</p>

    <p>The outcome of this battle was unexpected. But it was reasonable.</p>

    <p>The main reason for Zhu Han Yun's failure is nothing more than two points.</p>

    <p>First, he had already lost a lot of physical and spiritual energy before the arrival of the eighth day. Second, he was hesitant during the battle. He did not devote all his strength to kill Chen Chao before the {Titan Skill} disappeared. Instead, he wanted to kill Chen Chao. Keep your hands open for the next round.</p>

    <p>The result is now counterproductive. Not only did he not advance to the next round, but Chen Chao seized the opportunity and was eliminated in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>"This battle is really exciting. Our Titan skills are inferior to others. There is really nothing to say. Number 60 High School is a formidable young man. Chen Chao will definitely make achievements in physical skills in the future. Maybe he can really become like Li Xiaokai Such a great master." As the principal of Taitan High School, Liu Tian naturally felt ashamed when she saw her captain defeated.</p>

    <p>However, resentment is resentment. As the principal of one side, Liu Tian could not show it directly. He could only comment on the game on the spot and praised Chen Chao. It seemed that there was a sense of everyone's style in it.</p>

    <p>But as a classmate of Principal Liu Tian, Principal Chen of Number 60 High School knows very well what kind of person this old boy is. He is already so angry that he is vomiting blood at this moment.</p>

    <p>The other principals around him are not fools. You can definitely hear the sourness in Principal Liu Tian's words.</p>

    <p>If you compare a student in the Foundation Building period with the great master Li Xiaokai, isn't it clear that he has not set his position correctly... However, although the principals knew it well, their faces were still filled with polite smiles, and they all followed suit. After all, Taitan High School still has a chance at this time. But they still have a girl named Yan Xiaochun who has not been eliminated.</p>

    <p>Half time. According to the order drawn.</p>

    <p>The second round match is between Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it.</p>

    <p>This is a focused battle. As both sides prepare, relevant tactical discussions also begin. Although the six students fighting against Number 60 High School are from different colleges, for them at the moment. Number 60 High School is the common enemy...</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong can be killed, their morale will be greatly boosted! It is very likely that they will win consecutive games and defeat Number 60 High School in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong is probably the strongest person on the opposite side. As long as Sun Rong can be killed, I think we can almost push it evenly in the next few rounds!" Minami Yixiu made a judgment. Number 60 High The reason why School can still maintain abundant mental and physical energy up to now. A large part of the reason lies in the existence of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As long as Sun Rong is not eliminated, she can use her Aohai sword energy to help the team members recover a certain amount of spiritual and physical energy. The water-type sword spirit has its own so-called "nanny aura", which can be used for auxiliary treatment.</p>

    <p>So as long as the nanny can be killed, Number 60 High School's most powerful fulcrum will collapse in an instant!</p>

    <p>Now, everyone on Nan Yixiu's side has pinned their hopes on Yi Zhiyang. Even before Yi Zhiyang came on stage, Nan Yixiu also organized the other four people, including himself, to instill a little spiritual power into each person. On Yi Zhiyang. Make sure Yi Zhiyang has sufficient psychic energy when facing Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After about 10 minutes of preparation, the second focus showdown finally began.</p>

    <p>As the captain of Jian Shen Academy, Yi Zhiyang, he is already a dark horse in the competition.</p>

    <p>As the other side of the duel, Sun Rong. is the one that attracts the most attention.</p>

    <p>"Come on classmate Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was injured just now. But now he was shouting louder than anyone else!</p>

    <p>Because just now, Sun Rong used Aohai to heal some of his injuries with his own hands. The gentle feeling was like his classmate Sun Rong was touching him personally... it instantly filled him with blood.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I will definitely win this game!" Sun Rong's face was filled with a confident smile. The school uniform skirt on her lower body was swaying slightly, dancing with the wind.</p>

    <p>Opposite him, Yi Zhiyang folded his arms coldly. The pure white uniform of Jian Shen College made him look particularly dazzling when standing in the sun. He was like a son of the sun.</p>

    <p>Both sides are masters of swordsmanship. What kind of collision will happen has made many people curious.</p>

    <p>And at the next moment, with the surge of Yi Zhiyang's aura, many people's expressions suddenly changed!</p>

    <p>"Is this... the sword spirit incarnation?" Many people's eyes twitched, and they all showed incredulous expressions.</p>

    <p>It's just a Foundation Building period. How can we actually achieve the point where man and sword become one?</p>

    <p>Many people can't believe their eyes.</p>

    <p>By using the fusion of human and sword, you can fuse yourself with the spiritual sword and invisibly slash out sword energy... and this is not a bad rule. Because in theory, as long as you don't use the magic weapon of the spiritual sword, it is normal. Physical duel.</p>

    <p>"So you know how to do this." Facing Yi Zhiyang's aggressive aura. Sun Rong was naturally not at a disadvantage here either.</p>

    <p>As a talented beautiful girl, she has mastered the art of combining man and sword a long time ago. However, Sun Rong has never used it before. The main reason is that she still feels a little ashamed.</p>

    <p>Because after she merges with the Aohai Spirit Sword, it will produce a transformation effect similar to that of a magical girl...</p>
