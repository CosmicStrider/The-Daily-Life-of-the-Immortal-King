  <h1>Chapter 2067 Sword Master and Disciple's Trip to the Great Western Spiritual Sea</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu didn't know if Yi Jianchuan did it on purpose. He repeatedly asked questions and interfered with him when he was not exerting himself.</p>

    <p>He swore that he had worked really hard. He stayed calm and survived the first few problems...</p>

    <p>However, when he heard with his own ears that Yi Jianchuan wanted to help him find his biological parents, Wang Muyu finally couldn't stand it any longer.</p>

    <p>Looking at the sluice in front of him that had collapsed due to the explosion, Wang Muyu really felt like he didn't know how to explain it.</p>

    <p>Alas. After all, my mood is still not calm enough.</p>

    <p>He looked for the main reason for this failure. As for the starting move of this trick of dripping water through stone, he thought that he had reproduced it very beautifully after watching it once. The flowing clouds and flowing water were even smoother than Yi Jianchuan's own execution.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. The car overturned at the last critical moment.</p>

    <p>It's impossible to explain. Wang Muyu feels that at times like this, the only way to get through is by acting cute.</p>

    <p>"Teacher... I..."</p>

    <p>So when he looked at Yi Jianchuan with an innocent face, Yi Jianchuan saw the fear in the little guy's eyes that didn't look like a show at all. Even as a sword master, he was immediately obsessed with this cute little guy.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid Muyu. You... did a good job!" Yi Jianchuan immediately stopped looking at him like he was looking at a little monster and praised directly.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu has long been recognized by him as a peerless genius, the spiritual power that was erupted from the drop of water on his finger just now would never be achieved without reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan frowned. He released his spiritual consciousness and began to carefully sense Wang Muyu's spiritual power. As a result, he was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, the teacher is asking you, do you know your cultivation level? Have you ever practiced in particular?"</p>

    <p>"No. I haven't deliberately practiced..." Wang Muyu replied.</p>

    <p>This is not a lie, because he really has no special training. It is mainly because of his bloodline, so he is naturally strong.</p>

    <p>However, this answer gave the sword master a big shock.</p>

    <p>"Born Golden Core..."</p>

    <p>He had not checked Wang Muyu's specific realm before. But now that he had sensed it, he realized that Wang Muyu had already reached the peak of the late Golden Core at such a young age.</p>

    <p>If there is no special cultivation result from birth to now, unless one is born with a supreme master of Golden Core, it is absolutely impossible to cultivate to this level at this age.</p>

    <p>Of course, this is the result of Wang Muyu's suppression.</p>

    <p>If Yi Jianchuan knew his true state, he would probably faint from shock.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, this sluice now..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. It's just a sluice gate. This sluice gate has been in disrepair for a long time. It should have been demolished and rebuilt a long time ago. As a retired general, I care about our country's infrastructure construction. There seems to be nothing wrong with it, right?"</p>

    <p>"The teacher makes sense..."</p>

    <p>Then, Yi Jianchuan gently put his hand on Wang Muyu's shoulder: "Muyu, listen carefully. From now on, you must not do anything easily in front of outsiders. You are too dazzling and easy to be hated by others. Therefore, the teacher wants to protect yourself well."</p>

    <p>These words played right into Wang Muyu's wish. The little guy immediately agreed: "Okay. This disciple will listen to the teacher."</p>

    <p>"Very good." Yi Jianchuan nodded with satisfaction. Then he continued: "But the teacher thinks it is necessary to look for your parents."</p>

    <p>"Teacher, actually, this is not that urgent..."</p>

    <p>"Hey, I understand... Teacher, I understand everything..." Yi Jianchuan sighed.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Muyu's cute and well-behaved appearance, he felt a throbbing pain in his heart. He felt even more pitiful for Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>After all, those irresponsible parents cruelly abandoned him for many years. It is normal for the little guy to have no feelings for his biological parents.</p>

    <p>But giving birth without nourishment is a sin in itself.</p>

    <p>The modern world of cultivation is a society governed by law.</p>

    <p>He had to find these two people...</p>

    <p>As a sword master, although Yi Jianchuan is old, his passion for upholding justice has never calmed down because of age.</p>

    <p>He despises such irresponsible parents the most.</p>

    <p>After all, as a sword master, he himself has experienced it himself. For example, his son was also adopted by him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in this regard, as a sword master, Yi Jianchuan always has a special obsession.</p>

    <p>"Muyu. The teacher knows that you have no feelings for that couple. And the teacher also knows very well. The person who can give birth to you must not be an ordinary person. Although there are many people in the world of cultivation, there are also geniuses in the head."</p>

    <p>At this time, Yi Jianchuan looked at him and asked, "Tell the teacher that you have no memory at all about them?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Muyu felt extremely ashamed. He looked at Yi Jianchuan's extremely serious face and thought that if there was no ending to this matter, he might not be able to get around it.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this reality comes just in time...</p>

    <p>Because just a few seconds ago, he received an instruction from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the little guy raised his head and said without thinking: "Daxiling Sea Area...",</p>

    <p>Daxiling sea area?</p>

    <p>The legendary restricted area for sailing?</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan frowned slightly: "Are you sure, Muyu? The current location of our master and apprentice. It is half a world away from the Daxiling Sea..."</p>

    <p>"Sometimes some pictures always flash back in my mind."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu sighed: "Like Daxiling hai. I don't know if it has anything to do with my parents, but it really appears in my mind."</p>

    <p>"Fragmented memory?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, teacher... just like a while ago. I also dreamed about the pressure cooker on the bus..."</p>

    <p>"Pressure cooker?"</p>

    <p>I have to say, the little guy's acting skills were excellent. There was no sense of violation at all. Yi Jianchuan believed it and was stunned on the spot.</p>

    <p>Generally, there are only two types of people who can bring a pressure cooker on the bus.</p>

    <p>Auntie who likes to make soup...</p>

    <p>And a bomb maniac with antisocial personality...</p>

    <p>But there are no clues about the bus pressure cooker. And it's not necessarily a bus in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>There are buses traveling across the country. If this will be investigated until the Year of the Monkey and the Horse.</p>

    <p>"Then besides Daxiling Sea Area, what else can you think of?" Yi Jianchuan asked again.</p>

    <p>Because at this time, just having the clue of Daxiling Sea Area is not enough.</p>

    <p>The Daxiling Sea Area is also very vast. That mysterious maritime restricted area is one of the top ten unsolved mysteries in the world of cultivation today.</p>

    <p>Full of unknown risks.</p>

    <p>But for Yi Jianchuan, as a sword master, he is not afraid.</p>

    <p>And that place is on the high seas. No visa is required. If he wants to investigate, he can just go there with his sword.</p>

    <p>"Snow White Ship..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu gave the information again.</p>

    <p>In fact, the snow-white ship he was talking about was actually the Yueguang that Qiao Yanyuan was riding.</p>

    <p>"Is it a snow-white ship located in the restricted navigation area of Daxiling Sea...</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>It seems that their first practice mission after meeting master and disciple has come...</p>
