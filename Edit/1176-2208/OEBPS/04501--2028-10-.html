  <h1>Chapter 2028 The ancestral land of the Sun family. 100,000 mountains</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The legendary ancestral land of the Sun family. In fact, it is a maze composed of countless mountains and jungle terrain. Although there are many natural treasures inside, it is also full of dangers.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is also abbreviated as Shiwandashan.</p>

    <p>As soon as Mingyue Ye entered here, he felt that this place was a special cave. It was completely different from the earth. Because the spiritual energy of heaven, material and earth treasures mutually strengthened and erupted, the spiritual energy of the cave world in the belly of the whale was even richer than that on the earth. Come higher.</p>

    <p>The origin of this ancient whale. It seems very unusual...</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye suddenly had a plan in mind. If he could swallow most of the treasures here to regain his strength, and then find a way to stew and eat this ancient whale, it might help him directly cross a great realm!</p>

    <p>Of course, Mingyue Ye also knows that an ancient whale like this, which has been hidden on the earth for so many years and has not been discovered by human cultivators, cannot grow to this point by relying on its own strength alone.</p>

    <p>In other words, is there a powerful person behind this?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this on Mingyue Night, I felt a little vigilant in my heart.</p>

    <p>There are many people raising Kuns in the universe. Some of the top ten aristocratic families in the Divine Realm even set up special Kun farms. Those Kuns raised with good talents are trained into mounts and war beasts. Guard the family's important territory.</p>

    <p>Even if you are not very talented, you can still cook it and turn it into delicious food on the table.</p>

    <p>And the ancient whale in front of her. Although Mingyue Ye was in her belly, she could feel that the bloodline composition of this ancient whale was very complex...</p>

    <p>As a professional illusionist, it is not difficult for Mingyue Ye to guess that the appearance of himself transformed into a spiritual whale is probably just a disguise.</p>

    <p>Big skin surgery...</p>

    <p>Mingyueye immediately thought of the Heavenly Dao spell, an illusion type.</p>

    <p>Now, things get interesting.</p>

    <p>The corners of his lips curled up in the bright moonlit night. His smile gradually became cunning.</p>

    <p>An "ancient whale" that knows how to use Heavenly Dao to disguise itself. It has been hidden in the deep sea of the earth for a long time. What is its true identity?</p>

    <p>Who is the owner who can support it to survive until now? Who has been keeping it in captivity silently behind the scenes?</p>

    <p>I really want to know these on Mingyue Night.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Major skin surgery.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the submarine, Wang Ling thought of this almost at the same time.</p>

    <p>There is no way. He controls many Heavenly Dao spells. With a total of 30,000 Heavenly Dao in ten universes, the amount of data is too huge. It is a bit troublesome to compare and retrieve them one by one.</p>

    <p>Especially with illusion-type spells like Great Skin and Great Shapeshifting. It's easy to mistake the two.</p>

    <p>After all, the ancient whale that can survive for such a long time will definitely not be just a spiritual whale in its bloodline structure. This ancient whale has existed since before the earth was upgraded. The lifespan of a conventional oceanic spiritual whale is only three thousand years.</p>

    <p>Three thousand years is a critical node for the spirit whale. If it can transcend the realm and transcend itself, its lifespan can be up to five thousand years.</p>

    <p>So it is very unusual that this "ancient whale" can live for such a long time.</p>

    <p>But what exactly is the opponent's bloodline? Wang Ling plans to use the "Great Blood Source Technique" to observe it after direct contact.</p>

    <p>Measurements at close range will be more accurate.</p>

    <p>After all, this matter concerns Dao Ancestor Wang. Wang Ling feels that he cannot be careless at all.</p>

    <p>"Huh? Ling Zhenren said. Big Skin Technique? This ancient whale actually knows Heavenly Dao... It does seem a bit unusual."</p>

    <p>Within the team communication technique, Immortal Toya heard Wang Ling's analysis. He looked at Wang Ling in confusion.</p>

    <p>The Great Transformation Technique is a spell that allows one to perform plastic surgery or make fine adjustments to one's face. Generally, it is more suitable for human cultivators. In theory, as long as one masters this technique, one can change into the appearance of anyone.</p>

    <p>Moreover, most Heavenly Dao type illusions have a "real illusion" effect. Just like Wang Ling's "real clone" Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>The "real clone" has intelligence. The clone will not be forcibly recalled due to injuries to the main body. It can also bleed and be injured. Moreover, it can be moved and replaced at critical moments to bear the attack for the main body.</p>

    <p>However, the displacement substitution takes the attack for the main body. Wang Ling is not used. For Wang Ling, sending out the crispy noodles means inserting an eye at the coordinate position in advance. You can do it when necessary. Change the position at any time and teleport there. Relay the crispy noodles to complete the next battle.</p>

    <p>In this vast universe, only Wang Ling himself has changed the life-saving method of "shifting and replacing" into an offensive method...</p>

    <p>"True Illusion" is easier to understand. This is a type of illusion cracking spell that is not easily parsed by Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>If the same Heavenly Dao spell is used for analysis and deciphering, then it depends on who has more Heavenly Dao layers and is more skillful.</p>

    <p>There are many creatures in the universe. The function of the Big Skin Technique is to allow you to perfectly blend into the group. Your appearance will instantly change into the appearance of the creature you have seen. And without revealing any flaws.</p>

    <p>"In other words, the ancient whale that has been protecting our Sun family's ancestral land may not be a real spiritual whale?" Sun Rong asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren's analysis is not wrong. It is very likely that this is the case, Miss Sun. Think about it. How many spiritual beasts on this earth can understand Heavenly Dao?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya responded: "And I have an intuition. I feel that this ancient whale is not a spiritual beast. It may be a holy beast or a mythical beast."</p>

    <p>While everyone was discussing the team voice technique, Mr. Zanghu suddenly exclaimed: "Everyone, pay attention. A biological signal has appeared!"</p>

    <p>On the radar signal screen in front of them, there was a high-speed moving creature approaching their submarine as if falling from the sky.</p>

    <p>The light spot moved too fast. It made people feel a little vigilant.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling almost subconsciously used the six-pointed star array to continue to control the sea gorilla outside. He planned to fight back against the creature flying at high speed.</p>

    <p>When the creature approached, Mr. Zanghu's brows suddenly rose: "This is..."</p>

    <p>He rubbed his eyes and made sure he saw it correctly. It was a golden conch that was speeding towards us!</p>

    <p>Why would a golden conch approach them so quickly at this time?</p>

    <p>He hasn't figured it out yet. Wang Ling on the other side is already planning to take action.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to raise his hand to cast a spell to imprison the suddenly attacking creature, he saw Sun Rong suddenly grab his wrist. He quickly transmitted the message: "Classmate Wang Ling. Wait a minute! I I feel that this golden conch seems a bit familiar..."</p>

    <p>These words reminded Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, he swept it with his spiritual sense. The whole person was stunned for an instant.</p>

    <p>"It's Mr. Boss Sun." Wang Ling replied. At the same time, he was secretly relieved.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Sun Rong recognized the origin of this golden conch. Otherwise, he just took action. Although it did not directly kill Sun Yiyuan, the golden conch might not have been saved.</p>

    <p>He should have been more cautious. It was only because Sun Yiyuan arrived too suddenly. In addition, he had been thinking about the problem just now. Therefore, as soon as he saw the invading enemy, he subconsciously planned to protect the submarine. He failed to use his spiritual sense to distinguish carefully.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa... why are you here?" Sun Rong almost became nervous all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Boss Sun should already know that we are trying to find the Sun family's ancestral land." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"What should we do?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, don't be nervous. Just take it one step at a time."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. At the same time, he also said with lingering fear: "Speaking of which, classmate Wang Ling almost pinched my grandfather to death just now..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The next second, there was a bang. Sun Yiyuan's face appeared on the glass screen of the submarine.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun's hair was completely scattered by the sea water. He looked like a water ghost. His old face and octopus feet, slightly swollen by the sea water, seemed to be firmly attached to the external video recording equipment of the submarine: "Rongrong Ah. It's me. I'm grandpa... let me in quickly..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Boss Sun is a comedian...</p>
