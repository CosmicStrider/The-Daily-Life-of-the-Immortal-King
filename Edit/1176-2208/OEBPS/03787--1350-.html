  <h1>Chapter 1350 He is indeed the boy Rongrong likes!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling never expected that his Wang Ling would manifest itself in this form.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's whole body was whipped away.</p>

    <p>At that moment. Wang Ling only felt that all movements seemed to slow down.</p>

    <p>Then, Gu Shunzhi fell into the water with a 360Â° full rotation, causing a huge splash...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the scene in the Love Pavilion began to become chaotic. Liu Qingyi didn't know why he made these thoughts and actions that were completely inconsistent with his intentions.</p>

    <p>It was a chaotic scene. Countless people's gazes came over.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi covered her face and quickly fled the scene.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now?" Fang Xing was speechless for a while.</p>

    <p>"I'll go take a look..."</p>

    <p>"What about Gu Shunzhi?"</p>

    <p>"I need to trouble Brother Fang to keep an eye on him for me. I'll settle the score with him when I come back!"</p>

    <p>"Okay." Fang Xing nodded.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen estimated that Gu Shunzhi most likely did something to apologize to Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, how could Liu Qingyi get so angry on the spot and get so angry in front of everyone?</p>

    <p>There was no time to think about it. He immediately put down what he was doing and chased after him.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Zhen is also thinking about what kind of grudges happened between Liu Qingyi and Gu Shunzhi...</p>

    <p>He remembered what Liu Qingyi had just shouted.</p>

    <p>Two boats?</p>

    <p>What does this mean...</p>

    <p>Is there really any relationship between Gu Shunzhi and her?</p>

    <p>Was he discovered by Liu Qingyi?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was really angry.</p>

    <p>The majestic orderer!</p>

    <p>He would actually do such a ridiculous thing!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Gu Shunzhi got up from the water, the director of the aquarium also came after hearing the news.</p>

    <p>The curator is settling the losses.</p>

    <p>This broken glass wall needs to be completely replaced.</p>

    <p>This piece of glass alone costs 500,000...</p>

    <p>In addition, there are five sea lions floating in the water that were frightened and fainted...this mental compensation is also needed.</p>

    <p>They were frightened during the mating process. This group of sea lions are likely to have sexual dysfunction!</p>

    <p>On the premise of one-on-one mating. Why might five sea lions develop mental disorders?</p>

    <p>The answer is simple...</p>

    <p>Because among them, three sea lions chose to have a meeting together.</p>

    <p>"Hey. The cost of recovery is a lot of money!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the curator with a goatee looked at the scene in front of him with a worried look on his face.</p>

    <p>He was holding a calculator in his hand and was calculating the losses.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stepped forward and patted the curator on the shoulder. </p>

    <p>Things have reached this point. This is something Wang Ling did not expect...</p>

    <p>The cost of the loss. Wang Ling feels that Gu Shunzhi should not bear it alone.</p>

    <p>This is a huge expense. With Wang Ling's limited pocket money, it is definitely not something we can afford.</p>

    <p>However, equivalent exchanges are still possible.</p>

    <p>The goatee-bearded aquarium curator felt someone tapping his shoulder. When he turned around, he spotted Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's Mr. Wang mentioned in the previous group report!</p>

    <p>The curator reacted immediately.</p>

    <p>Although he has never seen Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, when Wang Ling entered the museum, his mobile phone also received a notification from the group.</p>

    <p>Although there are many people in the venue today, the most senior customer who can come in through the VIP channel is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Plus this VIP location map in the hand of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This allowed the aquarium director to lock his identity instantly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made a silent gesture. Then he looked at the messy scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>Then a Talisman was handed over to the director of the aquarium.</p>

    <p>This is a scapegoat that Heavenly Dao drew for Sun Rong before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling currently has more than 60,000 sheets in the drawer...</p>

    <p>This talisman is worthless in Wang Ling's hands. But it is priceless when placed outside.</p>

    <p>The director of the aquarium is a fairly knowledgeable person.</p>

    <p>He distinguished the talisman carefully.</p>

    <p>I quickly recognized the Talisman in his hand. It might be the legendary "death charm"...</p>

    <p>The value of one piece is hundreds of millions!</p>

    <p>Not to mention compensation for losses.</p>

    <p>You can also build a new aquarium next to it...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Wang. Wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>The curator hurriedly chased after him and took Wang Ling to a secluded location. He respectfully whispered to Wang Ling: "If these people are acquaintances of Mr. Wang, the library will not pay compensation. Let's pursue it again. Mr. Wang's death talisman is priceless. I'm so flattered. I really can't bear it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>This incident happened because of him. He should be compensated for the losses.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the death talisman in his hand is not worth much in the first place. As long as he is not asked to hand over the crispy noodles, everything is easy to talk about.</p>

    <p>The curator does not dare to accept money from Wang Ling. Mainly because he is afraid of being blamed by his superiors.</p>

    <p>However, now that he saw "Mr. Wang" in front of him with such a decisive attitude, he hesitated for a moment.</p>

    <p>"How about accepting it first and then asking the upper management to return it?" the curator thought to himself.</p>

    <p>This is probably the best way to handle it right now.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mr. Boss Sun was deeply moved after learning what happened in the aquarium.</p>

    <p>Originally, the relationship between Wang Ling and Wang Zhen was that they were classmates.</p>

    <p>So Mr. Boss Sun came to help Wang Ling. He didn't think there was anything strange about it...</p>

    <p>Weird place.</p>

    <p>In fact, Boss Sun actually doesn't care what happened to Liu Qingyi and the others.</p>

    <p>All his thoughts were focused on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"As expected of classmate Wang Ling!" Mr. Boss Sun slammed the table excitedly. I don't know how happy he was.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I just help my classmates lose money..." Jiang Xiaoche wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>"What do you know! My classmate Wang Ling was actually able to intervene in the emotional disputes of several classmates in the aquarium... Such a sense of loyalty. I have the demeanor of my youth."</p>

    <p>After Boss Sun finished speaking, he showed his mobile phone and said, "Do you know what this is?"</p>

    <p>This is a photo of Talisman taken by the aquarium curator.</p>

    <p>Because he didn't know how to deal with the "death talisman" better, the curator immediately sent it to Boss Sun after taking the photo.</p>

    <p>"This seems to be...a scapegoat?"</p>

    <p>When Jiang Xiaoche saw the photo, he was also shocked: "How could this kid have such..."</p>

    <p>Death talismans are notoriously expensive in the industry.</p>

    <p>And some people can't buy this kind of life-saving thing even if they spend money!</p>

    <p>Because the number of people who can draw this kind of Talisman is extremely limited!</p>

    <p>The number of scapegoats currently circulating outside is pitiful.</p>

    <p>"This talisman is very capable of being drawn by someone. Based on the family conditions of classmate Wang Ling, I inferred that this talisman should be a family heirloom of classmate Wang... Unexpectedly, classmate Wang actually used scapegoat for other classmates. Fu compensated them for the damage to the venue. What a stupid kid..."</p>

    <p>"He should know that he is already a senior VIP of our group. There is no need to spend this wasted money." Jiang Xiaoche frowned.</p>

    <p>"The problem arises here. Classmate Wang deliberately left this death talisman. This is because he does not want to owe our group a favor. With the value of this death talisman, classmate Wang is enough to become our VIP user. This shows. My classmate Wang is still a very understanding and sophisticated person!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Mr. Boss Sun sighed: "And if you look at the photos taken by the curator...this talisman is clean and tidy. It's as good as new. It's like it was newly drawn..."</p>

    <p>The old man said no more.</p>

    <p>A super Talisman like the Death Talisman cannot be drawn easily.</p>

    <p>In most cases, death talismans are drawn by powerful people who know that their end is approaching but cannot break through, so they spend their entire lives drawing it.</p>

    <p>These death talismans can then be passed on to one's disciples and grandchildren for use in critical moments to save one's life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the death talisman is also called "the ultimate thing." Its gold content is extremely high.</p>

    <p>What shocked Mr. Boss Sun was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is actually able to preserve his family heirlooms as if they were newly painted...</p>

    <p>Such love and cherishment makes Boss Sun even more happy.</p>

    <p>He is indeed the boy that his precious granddaughter Rongrong has fallen in love with... indeed extraordinary!...</p>
