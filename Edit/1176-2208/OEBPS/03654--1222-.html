  <h1>Chapter 1222 The boss of the killer world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>During class that day, Wang Ling stared at the blackboard with his head upright. His eyelids were beating wildly. Even when he went to the toilet and looked in the mirror, he could see his frown and dark clouds covering his head, which seemed like a sign of death. It felt like the stars were coming... It wasn't until the afternoon when school was almost over that my eyelids stopped twitching abnormally.</p>

    <p>The negotiations between Sun Yiyuan and Principal Chen, Lao Gudong eventually broke up.</p>

    <p>Principal Chen failed to agree to Boss Sun's conditions because he could not make the decision on behalf of Wang Ling in this matter.</p>

    <p>The behavior of paying to accompany students is a bit of class-based privilege. The Sun family is from a superior family. Using money to find a student whose family is not as well-off as the Sun family to accompany them to study. Doesn't this really affect a child's self-esteem?</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School teaches and educates people. Results are important. But Chen Tianxiang actually pays more attention to the psychological development of children.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he thinks Mr. Boss Sun's behavior is a little excessive. If he just suggested that the teachers from Number 60 High School take time to provide tutoring, he thinks this is still okay. And tutoring is tutoring. The teacher who provides tutoring cannot charge a single point. Money. Otherwise, this matter will go sour.</p>

    <p>On the way back, the air pressure in the private car was very low. Lao Gudong stared out the window. His voice was as calm as when he left: "Is this really good?"</p>

    <p>Principal Chen skillfully took out a cigarette from the inner pocket of his clothes. He lit the cigarette using the rapid friction of his index finger and thumb to generate heat. He took a deep breath. There was a bit of a bitter smile on his face: "I have mine. The bottom line of principles is to teach and educate people. If even I, the principal, don't have the rules, how can I lead the teachers and children below."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Lao Gudong nodded.</p>

    <p>However, after this trip, he and Principal Chen can be sure that even if the negotiations fail to reach an agreement, the Sun family will not lose a penny for the investment in the construction of Number 60 High School. With the Sun family's financial resources. I won't even think of retracting my previous promise just because of this trivial matter.</p>

    <p>For businessmen, breaking trust is a taboo.</p>

    <p>"Do you think Mr. Sun's personality is the kind of person who makes unreasonable demands?" Lao Gudong suddenly asked after the car was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Principal Chen frowned: "It seems that you have noticed it too."</p>

    <p>"Is the Sun family in trouble?"</p>

    <p>"It should be a big trouble." Principal Chen nodded: "A trouble that would make Sun Yiyuan sick and seek medical treatment in a hurry. This trouble must be closely related to Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. But I still have a question."</p>

    <p>"You said."</p>

    <p>"How strong is Sun Yiyuan?"</p>

    <p>"Above me. On the same level as the Ten Generals."</p>

    <p>"The same level as the Ten Generals?" Lao Gudong was surprised.</p>

    <p>No wonder Mr. Sun, the boss, felt confident about the sword master just now.</p>

    <p>It turns out the answer is here.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was sitting cross-legged on his bed with bare feet. He was trying his best to figure out the reason why his eyelids were twitching wildly in the afternoon. Then all he could think about was the face of Mr. Boss Sun, who looked kind-hearted but had a hidden smile.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... visiting Sun Rong the day before yesterday still produced a butterfly effect. Trouble began to come one after another. However, Wang Ling on Sun Rong had already used King's Eyes to detect her. There was nothing strange about his body, nor was there any curse. So he didn't really understand why Mr. Boss Sun was so nervous.</p>

    <p>Some charlatans say, I have heard it and let it pass. If you take yourself too seriously, you will often be the one who gets hurt.</p>

    <p>However, the older generation seems to have a little bit of superstition in them. This superstition used to be reflected in various unrealistic folk remedies. Now it is reflected in all kinds of lavish health care articles in the circle of friends.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is the only granddaughter of Mr. Boss Sun. It is understandable that the old man loves Wang Ling so much. This kind of doting across generations. Wang Ling has also felt it in Mr. Wang.</p>

    <p>Even though Mr. Wang has Alzheimer's disease, he still remembers to give himself fruits to eat. He pedaled a tricycle from the village to the door of the villa. This incident gave Wang Ling a big shock at the time. He felt that he I will never forget it for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tonight. The person cooking is Father Wang.</p>

    <p>It was less than a month before the due date. Mother Wang needed a quieter time to raise her baby. So Father Wang obediently took over the housework, including laundry, cleaning, and even cooking.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Father Wang has never cooked...</p>

    <p>So the night before, Mother Wang personally found Wang Ling to have a heart-to-heart talk. She had no other request. She only asked Wang Ling to help decorate the kitchen utensils at home. Try not to discourage Father Wang from cooking. of positivity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is an obedient child. He will naturally act according to Mother Wang's wishes.</p>

    <p>So tonight, the dishes Father Wang served out were indeed very good. But these dishes were all made with the effect of "Legendary Kitchen Utensils." With these kitchen utensils in hand, even people who can no longer cook can make them. The dishes that come out look like the female anchor has added a beauty filter.</p>

    <p>Sour potato shreds, spicy oil-boiled fish, grandma's braised pork, steamed gluten balls, cold assorted vegetables...</p>

    <p>"It tastes good!" Mother Wang picked up a chopstick, with a happy smile on her face.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. Is this true? This is my first time cooking here. I just followed the steps in the video. Who thought I was so talented?" Father Wang was also shocked by his skills.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling took another look at the pots, pans, ladles and shovels that he had inspired... According to the feedback from King's Eyes, the durability of these kitchen utensils has dropped to 1/99...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was eating dishes that were almost the same as those made in restaurants. I sighed in my heart. Fortunately, Father Wang later became an Internet writer. Otherwise, he would definitely be a good idea to make nuclear bombs... I only made one It was just a meal. The kitchen utensils he had cooked with his own hands were almost scrapped. This shows how amazing Father Wang's destructive power is.</p>

    <p>Father Wang has the habit of turning on the TV and listening to the news while eating.</p>

    <p>Just as we cut to Mao Channel 1, the dignified and well-dressed female anchor suddenly received an urgent document from the side. The female anchor's face was calm. This reflected her extremely high professionalism: "The following is an urgent news."</p>

    <p>"Songhai City has just uncovered a criminal case of pretending to be a killer. The criminal suspect Ke is under emergency interrogation in the Number 1 Prison in Songhai City. It is reported that Ke has planned many professional assassination criminal activities and pretended to be the leader of the killer industry. Challenge. Earn illegally high challenge fees..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang watched the news and was amazed: "These days, when did Zhenyangtai speak for the killer world..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang smiled and said: "Dear, you don't understand this. I heard that since Shadow Stream was taken away, the killer circle has started to become more virtuous. In the past few months, we have solved many cases with the Xiuzhen Police Department."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang clicked her tongue: "This boss of the killer world is really weird!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This boss is you!</p>
