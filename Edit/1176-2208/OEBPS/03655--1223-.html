  <h1>Chapter 1223 The person pretending to be Ghost Ax Spirit Mother</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After dinner, we verified with Wang Ling and the Office of Strategic Deception. The prisoner mentioned by the female anchor of Zhenyang Channel is actually the person who has been pretending to be Mother Wang and acting as the "Ghost Ax Spirit Mother."</p>

    <p>This person's full name is Keorn Duncan. He is a blond and blue-eyed foreign cultivator. Lord Diulei sent the photo to Wang Ling for a look. This person is thin and does not look like Wang Ling to the West. The inherent impression of a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling also admits that he seems to be a bit rigid in this regard. However, in his understanding, Western cultivators do have certain requirements for bodybuilding.</p>

    <p>During the meeting of the International Cultivator Alliance, Western cultivators can tell by the size of their muscles. In contrast, Eastern cultivators pay more attention to the beauty of their bones, because the muscles on their bodies will naturally grow as they practice cultivation. But you can use magic to condense your muscles so that you don't look so exaggerated.</p>

    <p>So in comparison, the cultural differences between the East and the West can be seen in the "muscles." One is reserved and the other is unrestrained and enthusiastic. However, it is not ruled out that there are a small number of Eastern or Western cultivators who are influenced by each other's culture. Choose to go the other side's route.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, he was not like this before." Lord Diulei sent Keorn's current photo. Then he gave him an ID photo of Keorn. The Keorn in the ID photo is exactly what Wang Ling originally thought. It really looks like a bunch of muscles.</p>

    <p>But appearance is not the key. It is the document itself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised to find that this Keorn is actually from SBP!</p>

    <p>"SBP. What is this?" Er Ha was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said during the call: "It is an investigation organization that is parallel to the SCP Foundation. SCP is committed to investigating various unconfirmed cultivation secrets, magic weapons or mutant spiritual beasts. The SBP is equivalent to a detective investigation organization. It is affiliated with the International Cultivating Institute. They are under the Alliance of Explorers. However, the things they investigated are all based on evidence. This time they visited the Huaxiu country, they must have another purpose. Now they are sending Keorn to engage in espionage."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gently touched his chin. He felt that Keorn might be carrying an ulterior secret.</p>

    <p>"According to the clues obtained so far, Keorn has been in Huaxiu country for a long time in order to investigate something. In order to completely confirm his identity as a local cultivator, he changed his appearance and disguised himself as an Oriental. He also pretended to be the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Fraudulent activity funds and investigation funds."</p>

    <p>"This SBP is so stingy? It won't even give you any money?"</p>

    <p>"Obviously. Keorn doesn't intend to take this risk. Once caught, he will be deported directly." Lord Diulei actually felt a little confused when he said this.</p>

    <p>Judging from what we know so far, Keorn actually didn't do anything bad when he was pretending to be Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Most of the people he killed were wanted criminals, including those who died in the stalactite cave before being resurrected before appearing. The Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao also died at the hands of Keorn.</p>

    <p>This person's strength is also very strong.</p>

    <p>If Diulei's combat power had not been superior, it would not have been possible to find clues and capture Keorn in such a short period of time.</p>

    <p>"Did he explain anything?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"Not a word has been mentioned so far. Moreover, a powerful forbidden curse has been planted on him. If he speaks even half a word, he will die. Forcibly breaking it will also trigger the effect of the forbidden curse. So this time I called Brother Ling. I also wanted to ask Ling. Brother, do you have any good ideas?" Lord Diulei said on the phone.</p>

    <p>Although his level is high now, there are many kinds of forbidden spells in the world of cultivation. In addition, Lord Diulei is not particularly proficient in spells and other things. Now he is trapped in this dilemma.</p>

    <p>If possible, Diulei actually doesn't want to trouble Wang Ling. But the problem is that this SBP is a bit cunning. Even violent demolition will endanger lives. This is a bit difficult to handle.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, there must be a way.</p>

    <p>But what exactly is this forbidden curse? Wang Ling still needs to wait and see before we can be sure.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So that night, Er Ha received instructions from Wang Ling. Instead of Wang Ling, he came to Songhai City Number 1 Prison. Two guards at the prison gate saw a green dog with fluorescent hair all over its body under the night. Appear here. Open the gate immediately to let out.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, it is somewhat famous in the Office of Strategic Deception. This feeling of being respected by others makes Er Ha feel comfortable. It feels that it has found the same sense of social status as when it was the demon king in the demon world."</p>

    <p>Fistula in the prison. Lord Diulei was guarding the door. When he saw Er Ha appeared, he immediately stepped forward to greet him: "Brother Ling is not here?" Although it was a smile on his face, it was obvious that Er Ha could read a hint of disappointment in his tone.</p>

    <p>Er Ha walked in without raising his head: "Little Master Ling still has unfinished homework. He doesn't have to do these trivial matters himself."</p>

    <p>"It's not a little bit..."</p>

    <p>"New question type. I haven't fully mastered the two monsters yet. I need Little Master Ling to do it first."</p>

    <p>This reason is very good. For a moment, Lord Diulei was unable to refute.</p>

    <p>As expected of your brother! Even if the sky falls, it can't stop him from finishing his homework!</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Lord Diulei said: "If brother Ling doesn't come, who else can break this forbidden curse?"</p>

    <p>"It can be solved." After saying that, Er Ha spit out a glass bottle from his mouth. Lord Diulei saw that there was a floating eyeball in it... Although it had been taken out, Lord Diulei still glanced at it. I recognized it as the dead fish eye of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Little Master Ling asked me to wear an eyeball. It is enough to lift the forbidden spell."</p>

    <p>"As expected of your brother..." Lord Diulei held the glass bottle religiously and couldn't help but praise.</p>

    <p>"Don't do weird things to the glass bottle. Although this eyeball has been peeled off, the Little Master Eyeball also has feelings."</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog filtered it. How could a person like me do strange things to Brother Ling's eyes? The only person in the world who can do strange things is Brother Ling's brother."</p>

    <p>Er Ha ha ha. I thought that the crow laughing at the pig black is also very interesting.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>One person and one dog came to the interrogation room. Keorn was wearing a spirit chain and eating the box lunch provided by Warden Liang. Because of the forbidden spell, Warden Liang knew that even asking himself would be useless. It was better to let Keorn eat something first to avoid the foreigner. After the curse was lifted, I found excuses to shirk the blame.</p>

    <p>You must know that their prison's attitude towards prisoners has always been good.</p>

    <p>It's just that Warden Liang didn't expect Keorn to eat an astonishingly large amount of crispy chicken drumstick rice. He has already eaten more than 120 servings.</p>

    <p>The eaten lunch boxes piled up into a hill next to Keorn...</p>

    <p>"This SBP is too stingy. They don't even pay for meals. Look, this kid is hungry."</p>

    <p>When Er Ha arrived, he was shocked by the scene in front of him, "This guy is a match for the wildebeest."</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin's food intake has also decreased recently. He said he wants to lose weight. He doesn't even order takeout." Lord Diulei said: "He only grew taller by eating meat. His wings didn't grow at all. He can hardly fly anymore."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Keorn." At this time, Er Ha stared at the blue-eyed young man grabbing rice in the interrogation room.</p>

    <p>As soon as the young man raised his head, Lord Diulei opened the stopper of the glass bottle. Wang Ling's King's Eyes turned into a ray of light and flashed in front of Keorn!</p>

    <p>Buzz! The color of the King's Eyes begins to turn white. It emits a holy radiance!</p>

    <p>The entire interrogation room was suddenly shrouded in a dazzling light!</p>

    <p>"As expected of your brother..."</p>

    <p>"This is the effect of eye purification. It can purify all spells. It is a normal ability. Previously, the Lord's eyes had the effect of pregnant eyes. But this ability was removed by the Lord."</p>

    <p>"Pregnancy eyes?"</p>

    <p>"Just stare at whoever is pregnant."</p>

    <p>After Er Ha finished speaking, I felt helpless.</p>

    <p>It feels like Wang Ling is still prescient.</p>

    <p>If we really have the ability to "pregnant eyes" and let a few more little Wang Ling appear in this world for no reason... the earth will probably be directly exploded!</p>
