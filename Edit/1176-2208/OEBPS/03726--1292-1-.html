  <h1>Chapter 1292 Just shout once!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Daoxuan Hall. The monks and Miss Ajuan carry several of them each. The seven Dao Gods are piled up like corpses here.</p>

    <p>After going through the monk's "East Wind, 100% blood-blocking and stunning, Thousand Miles Head Hammer Technique."</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Gods have become what they are now. And they are still in a coma until now.</p>

    <p>Blood mixed with yellow liquid flowed out...</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan noticed that it was coming from the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>Among the seven Dao Gods, the head of the Zhou family is the worst.</p>

    <p>It was also a backlash injury. Only the head of the Zhou family's Dao God's brain was directly pierced by Wang Ling's finger.</p>

    <p>In other words. This backlash hurts and fills up.</p>

    <p>After suffering the most severe backlash injury, he also experienced a headbutt from the monk, which directly caused a bone fracture on his head.</p>

    <p>In other words, among the Seven Dao Gods, only the head of the Zhou family is cracked.</p>

    <p>"Monk, what's leaking out is not brain matter..." Miss Ajuan frowned and pinched her nose and asked.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Miss Ajuan. This is Dao God. You won't die if you shed some brains."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng's face was full of kindness: "And it's flowing out. There are only benefits."</p>

    <p>"What does this mean, monk?"</p>

    <p>"The brain fluid flowing out now may be the water flowing out of my brain when I chose to take action."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>Look at the Wang family, the Gu family and the Liu family. How can the heads of these three families understand it so well? Isn't it possible to just stay in seclusion?</p>

    <p>If you are not good at cultivation, you still have to intervene...</p>

    <p>This is great.</p>

    <p>The body suffered backlash. This week, the head of the Zhou family alone lost 100 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Of course, other family heads are not much better. On average, there are still seven Dao Ancestors in 80 lifetimes.</p>

    <p>The Liu family's ranking among the ten major families in God's Domain is originally tenth.</p>

    <p>And after this wave.</p>

    <p>The head of the Liu family will directly replace the Zhou family and successfully jump to third place.</p>

    <p>The monk seemed to be able to think of the way the head of the Liu family couldn't help but laugh out loud in the forbidden area.</p>

    <p>Now. The overall situation has been decided.</p>

    <p>After the seven Dao Gods were severely beaten, it indicates that the upgrade of the earth has become a certainty.</p>

    <p>"All clan elders, please come out."</p>

    <p>The monk turned the rosary beads in his hand and scanned a direction with his peripheral vision without raising his head.</p>

    <p>"Master..." Several Dao Supremes walked out of the ruins. Facing the scene in front of them, their hearts trembled.</p>

    <p>They would never have imagined that today's scene would happen...</p>

    <p>Jin Deng took out a contract from his sleeve: "You are all family elders. Now your family head is obviously incapacitated. You will be the representative. You will sign your blood on the contract."</p>

    <p>"Painting..."</p>

    <p>"After the painting is completed, it will be deemed that you have agreed to the earth upgrade plan...and you can receive a corpse of the head of the family as a reward."</p>

    <p>The corners of Dao Supreme's mouth twitched: "..."</p>

    <p>At present, this is obviously a helpless move.</p>

    <p>Their head of the family is seriously injured. If it continues to be delayed, something might happen...</p>

    <p>Losing a lifetime of cultivation means that their family heritage will be reduced.</p>

    <p>They cannot afford such a loss.</p>

    <p>"I'll go first!"</p>

    <p>"No! Don't fight with me! I'll sign first! My head is the most seriously injured!"</p>

    <p>"Fart! The leader of the Sheng family is obviously the worst offender! Didn't you see that his neck was hit so hard that it dug into his collarbone?"</p>

    <p>Then, this contract began to be snatched up by the Seven Dao Supremes.</p>

    <p>This situation couldn't help but make the monk sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>If we had known about this, why did we do it in the first place...</p>

    <p>Just like that, it took nearly half an hour.</p>

    <p>The seven Dao Supremes had another fight at the scene to compete for the right to give priority to the painting. The painting had just been completed.</p>

    <p>When everyone returned to their clan with their respective heads of family, their noses were bruised and their faces were swollen.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, walk slowly! When your master wakes up, remember to tell him that it was the monk who bumped into him. It has nothing to do with me!" Miss Ajuan looked at the departing figures of several clan elders and waved from a distance.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So far.</p>

    <p>The work before upgrading the earth was ready. The monk put away the contract and was about to go back. At this time, a stream of light suddenly fell from the sky.</p>

    <p>What was beyond the monk's expectation was that this person did not dress like a family elder. He seemed to be just an old servant.</p>

    <p>But this old servant's combat power is surprisingly strong.</p>

    <p>It has actually reached the level of Dao Supreme.</p>

    <p>You must know that the elders of the seven major families who took action earlier were still the elders of the major clans.</p>

    <p>Most of them are just the lower class of Dao Supreme. The strongest Zhou family is always the middle class of Dao Supreme.</p>

    <p>The monk turned his beads and figured out the origin of this old servant: "Are you from the Wang family?"</p>

    <p>"I have met Master Jin Deng. The master knows things like a god. The old man admires him." The servant's face was peaceful. He didn't come here just for the pottery stand.</p>

    <p>After all, the Wang family, the Gu family and the Liu family are all sensible families. They are not as skinny as the remaining seven families.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the servant also took out a contract from his lapel. This was the three heads of the Wang family, the Gu family and the Liu family. They personally agreed to the contract with the joint signatures stamped by the heads of the family.</p>

    <p>Now it is delivered by this old servant of the Wang family.</p>

    <p>The old man presented the joint contract with both hands. At the same time, there was an apologetic look on his face: "When the seven families took the initiative, the three masters did not help the master. I hope the master will understand..."</p>

    <p>"The poor monk won't mind."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "The most taboo thing in retreat is to have a shaken mind. It makes sense that the Gu family and the Wang family have been the top two in the divine domain for many years. The poor monk also thanked the three family heads for sending this joint contract. As a token of appreciation. Sincerity."</p>

    <p>"The master's magnanimity makes the old man admire him."</p>

    <p>After the old man finished speaking, he glanced around again.</p>

    <p>The monk knew who he was looking for: "Ling Zhenren. has gone back."</p>

    <p>"It's a pity that I couldn't meet Ling Zhenren." The old man from the Wang family sighed.</p>

    <p>He killed the Zhou Dao God when he appeared on the scene. Then he defeated the six Dao Gods with only the power of his body... What kind of shocking and terrifying power is this?</p>

    <p>When the head of the Wang family stamped the joint contract, he specifically told the old man to say hello if he saw Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>But now, it seems that fate has not come yet.</p>

    <p>Some things cannot be forced after all.</p>

    <p>"Although Ling Zhenren left, he left something behind. He asked me to give it to the elders of three wealthy families. I also hope that the old gentleman can hand it over on his behalf." At this time, the monk's words made the old man's eyes light up.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren actually left something behind. What is it?"</p>

    <p>"In fact, this is also the humble monk's suggestion."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said: "The three family heads are still in retreat. They have never taken action from the beginning to the end. Therefore, the poor monk thinks that the remaining seven major families will not give up. If they join forces to retaliate at this time, I am afraid it will be another disaster."</p>

    <p>"That's what the master said!" The old servant of the Wang family nodded.</p>

    <p>"Therefore, the monk asked Ling Zhenren to leave three golden talismans."</p>

    <p>The monk said. He moved his fingertips. Three streams of light flowed out from between his fingers and hit the old servant's hand in front of him.</p>

    <p>The old servant held the golden talisman in his hand. His hands were trembling: "May I ask Master, how to use this golden talisman?"</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "If you encounter trouble, just shout: Go and invite me Wang Ling Buddha! That's it."</p>
