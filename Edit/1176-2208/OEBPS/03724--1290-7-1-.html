  <h1>Chapter 1290 The End of the Seven Gods</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk fought against the two Dao Gods. This scene shocked all the cultivators in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>In an instant, spiritual consciousness became a sea, and countless eyes converged on the Daoxuan Hall.</p>

    <p>Although few cultivators in the divine realm dare to approach the core area where "Dao God's Will" strikes, they still use their spiritual senses to watch the battle remotely.</p>

    <p>The monk holds the sky with one hand, teasing the will of the two Dao Gods in the midst of applause. This makes countless cultivators in the divine realm unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Even the cultivators living in seclusion in the deep mountains and dense forests of God's Domain raised their heads one after another. They were alarmed by this powerful aura.</p>

    <p>Countless spiritual birds were surprised from the forest. They were chirping and densely covering the entire sky.</p>

    <p>It creates a magical scene as if darkness has fallen.</p>

    <p>"Is this a cultivator on Earth?"</p>

    <p>"When did such a famous figure appear on earth..."</p>

    <p>The sage of Buddhism. Terribly powerful!</p>

    <p>Obviously, the two heads of the Zhou family and the Li family did not expect that the monk would be so tyrannical.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, there was a loud noise and the sky collapsed.</p>

    <p>The monk's giant hands holding the two Dao God brains were freed.</p>

    <p>In the sky shrouded in blood, the huge hoof prints of a wild beast appeared. It was as huge as a mountain and rushed towards the monk's palm.</p>

    <p>The giant beast had a huge horn on its head. Its face was ferocious. Its whole body erupted with the thunder of divine will brought by the will of God, and was surrounded by black lightning.</p>

    <p>This is a creature summoned by the two brains of Dao God to get out of trouble.</p>

    <p>"Even the mythical beasts have appeared..." Many powerful men in the God's Domain exclaimed. They were shocked by the scene in front of them.</p>

    <p>It is rumored that the seven Dao Gods all have their own captive mythical beasts. The first one was an egg bred by extracting the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>After thousands of years of incubation and a lot of hard work, it has achieved its current combat strength.</p>

    <p>Although the will of the two Dao Gods came together, in fact they still fought independently.</p>

    <p>They didn't expect that the monk could catch them so quickly.</p>

    <p>In order to get out of trouble, I chose the method of summoning together.</p>

    <p>This Hunyuan Alicorn was raised in captivity by the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, the two Dao God's will is very clear. This summoned beast can only help them temporarily.</p>

    <p>The monk is too strong...</p>

    <p>Stronger than they imagined.</p>

    <p>Summoning it now is to buy time for the Dao God will of the head of the Li family to finally take shape.</p>

    <p>"A mythical beast born from chaos..."</p>

    <p>The monk was silent for a while.</p>

    <p>He actually has one too.</p>

    <p>But his mythical beast is still egg-shaped. It has been hatched for almost 300 lives and has not yet hatched...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the Hunyuan Alicorn belonging to the head of the Zhou family, with hoof prints as huge as mountains and a huge body tens of thousands of feet high, rushed towards his palm.</p>

    <p>This scene shocked everyone in the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>The monk didn't take it seriously at all. He slapped the beast away with his backhand.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise. A huge crack appeared in the sky.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought that this Hunyuan Alicorn might be of some use.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that this beast would be sent back into chaos with a slap from the monk.</p>

    <p>"This monk. It's terrible..."</p>

    <p>All the powerful men in the Divine Realm were amazed.</p>

    <p>This is the real immortal fight!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi are all stunned.</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng. So powerful!" Although Sun Rong has long known that the monk is very strong. He is not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>But as for "strong", this concept is very vague.</p>

    <p>Now I am immersed in the scene, witnessing with my own eyes the famous scene of a monk fighting two Dao Gods and swatting the flying mythical beast with his backhand.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's thoughts were racing for a moment. He truly felt the terror and shock of the power that transcended dimensions.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although the head of the Zhou family already knew that the Hunyuan Alicorn would not last long.</p>

    <p>However, as soon as he appeared on the scene, he was sent away by the monk.</p>

    <p>This is something the head of the Zhou family never expected.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, the will of Dao God of the head of the Li family has quickly taken shape in this short period of time.</p>

    <p>Now, two fully formed Dao God brains descend into the sky and join forces to fight against the monk.</p>

    <p>This made the monk look a little more serious.</p>

    <p>His palm once again bloomed with immeasurable Buddha light.</p>

    <p>Endless Buddha seals were densely packed along his fingers and covered his entire arm like insects crawling.</p>

    <p>"Infinite Buddha Seal!"</p>

    <p>This is a skill that the monk uses to press the bottom of the box. When the Buddha's seal is fully covered, it can greatly increase his combat power.</p>

    <p>Now instill all the Buddha's seals into your right hand! Gather strength!</p>

    <p>Became a real Buddha palm!</p>

    <p>I saw that the monk's palm swelled again and he grabbed the two Dao God's brains.</p>

    <p>In the palm of his hand, a "Âçç" character appeared!</p>

    <p>The swastika seal suppresses everything!</p>

    <p>The scene is like the impact of a comet, impacting the soul of every viewer.</p>

    <p>The monk has a clear assessment of his own combat power.</p>

    <p>Not to mention two Dao God brains.</p>

    <p>Even if the three of them were in their complete form, they would not be able to withstand his palm.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't previously damaged his cultivation for three thousand lifetimes, even the ten Dao Gods gathered together would not be his opponent!</p>

    <p>But at this moment.</p>

    <p>Two explosion-like sounds were heard in the sky again.</p>

    <p>A new Dao God has joined!</p>

    <p>And there are two of them!</p>

    <p>Countless people were shocked.</p>

    <p>"The head of the Wu family and the head of the Zhao family also joined..."</p>

    <p>"Quickly retreat!"</p>

    <p>The seven Dao Supremes who were watching on the side were frightened.</p>

    <p>They are very close to the battlefield.</p>

    <p>The will of the two Dao Gods impacted the core area of Daoxuan Hall. They could barely withstand the radiation.</p>

    <p>However, the four Dao Gods came...</p>

    <p>They already had a premonition that they would be unable to bear it next!</p>

    <p>If we wait for the Dao God will of the head of the Wu family and the head of the Zhao family to be fully formed.</p>

    <p>Even if they are Dao Supreme, if they are too close to the core area, they will lie on the ground like toads and cannot move...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Four gods come to the world!</p>

    <p>The terrifying mental pressure shook the divine realm to pieces!</p>

    <p>With Daoxuan Hall as the center, the ground there split open on the spot and stretched for thousands of miles.</p>

    <p>Powerful spiritual energy spreads out. It is a destructive force, destroying everything around it.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled bitterly in his heart. Unexpectedly, he actually forced out the four Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>The scene gradually got out of control.</p>

    <p>"You are going too far!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, a holy feather rose from the sky and pierced the sky!</p>

    <p>As the feathers shuttled through the air, they grew from small to large at a speed visible to the naked eye. Finally, they turned into an astonishing thousand-foot-long feather sword, slashing towards the brain of Dao God!</p>

    <p>From the west of Daoxuan Hall!</p>

    <p>It was Miss Ajuan who joined the fray.</p>

    <p>The monk saw the girl waving her wings behind her and soaring up with her petite body. She rose to the sky without fear of the oppression of the four Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>She used her spiritual thoughts to control the feather sword. She slashed it in the air!</p>

    <p>Exuding a terrifying divine aura!</p>

    <p>Countless angel feathers fell from the sky like rain...</p>

    <p>"King of the God Realm... this matter is a dispute in our cultivation world. Do you want to get involved..."</p>

    <p>Collapse!</p>

    <p>The soul-stirring voice of Dao God in the void sounded from all directions.</p>

    <p>Just use Dao God's sound wave to directly disperse the girl's sword light!</p>

    <p>Because it was so chaotic and ethereal, it was hard to tell which family leader's voice belonged to it.</p>

    <p>"Ah? I'm here to persuade you to make peace... even if you four are having a lot of fun right now, you may have to pay the bill later!" Miss Ajuan reminded kindly.</p>

    <p>The girl's attitude is already obvious.</p>

    <p>Compared to the Dao God in these divine realms, she certainly doesn't want to offend the hot man who is peeking at the screen on earth...</p>

    <p>Intervening at this time was actually something the girl was considering.</p>

    <p>She knows her own strength.</p>

    <p>Before she grows into Ten Thousand Winged God, she cannot be the opponent of these Dao God. In fact, she cannot help the monk at all.</p>

    <p>But Miss Ajuan also knows it very well.</p>

    <p>These Dao Gods would not dare to touch her.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it will trigger a war between gods, and the gods will not be able to bear it.</p>

    <p>In order to deal with a monk. The fate of the four Dao Gods...</p>

    <p>This is something that all cultivators in the divine realm have never thought of.</p>

    <p>Normally, the heads of these big families would not show up easily.</p>

    <p>If the monk dies in this battle, it will also be a legendary battle...</p>

    <p>Is it too much?</p>

    <p>It seems to be quite excessive...</p>

    <p>However, what people didn't expect was that something even more extreme was to come.</p>

    <p>Not long after Miss Ajuan, the King of the Divine Realm, kindly reminded me.</p>

    <p>Three more Dao Gods have joined the battlefield...</p>

    <p>From the Ai family, the Ou family and the Sheng family!</p>

    <p>Now!</p>

    <p>This is the end of the Seven Gods!</p>

    <p>Except for the Gu family, Wang family and Liu family...</p>

    <p>The heads of the other seven major families all took action!</p>

    <p>"Are you going to compete with the poor monk to see who is more outrageous?" the monk asked.</p>

    <p>"So what..."</p>

    <p>The voice of Dao God echoes.</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Gods took action. Their attitude was already very clear.</p>

    <p>If they don't move, that's it. If they do, the monk will be put to death.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk stared at the scene of the fate of the seven gods in the sky. He smiled bitterly in his heart: "Ling Zhenren... you can take action! If you don't, this poor monk is really going to see the Buddha..."</p>

    <p>The monk just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>In the God's Realm, a hand can wrap around the entire God's Realm.</p>

    <p>It stretched out from an unknown direction.</p>

    <p>Join the fray!</p>

    <p>With just one middle finger, he pierced the brain of the head of the Zhou family on the spot...</p>
