  <h1>Chapter 1282 Death is coming</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This chilling feeling went straight to the soul. It gave Fan Xing goosebumps all over his body.</p>

    <p>However, he still did not give up the idea of seeking information.</p>

    <p>Although there are rumors outside that Sun Rong is critically ill, this matter is of great importance. The young man cannot just listen to the outside world's words. That's why he thought of coming to the villa where Sun Rong lives to find out the truth.</p>

    <p>There are ten thousand sincere thoughts in his heart. Sun Rong It is best to die.</p>

    <p>As long as we can get confirmation of death.</p>

    <p>He can immediately ask several stock traders under the company to accurately cash out from the stock market.</p>

    <p>If we act now, there are actually risks.</p>

    <p>The young man's savings are not very large. He wants to do something big this time and invest all his funds.</p>

    <p>Therefore. This requires more robustness.</p>

    <p>For the past two days, he continued to stay here and cause trouble. He used various rogue methods to try to anger the head maid here and the maids below, so as to find out the truth.</p>

    <p>However, everyone here is tight-lipped. No matter what he asks, he refuses to say more than a word.</p>

    <p>This makes Fan Xing feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>This is. Fan Xing turned his attention to Zhuo Yi who was standing next to Aunt Qiu.</p>

    <p>He knew that Zhuo Yi was Sun Rong's senior. There must be some connection between the two.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zhuo Yi also has a special work permit from the Huaguo Shuilian Group hanging on his chest.</p>

    <p>This suddenly gave Fan Xing new hope.</p>

    <p>Maybe. Zhuo Yi might know something.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the young man did not realize that his behavior was seeking death.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this Zhuo General Administration?"</p>

    <p>Fan Xing said with a hint of contempt: "I don't know why an outsider from the General Administration Zhuo came to my Sun Rong sister's place? My sister and I have already made a private life. You come here now to show your courtesy. Isn't it too late? A little more?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's mouth twitched fiercely. Not to mention Aunt Qiu. He couldn't help it anymore!</p>

    <p>But in this matter, senior Heavenly Dao has already taken action. Zhuo Yi just needs to be patient and watch the show.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by the young man in overalls.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. He felt a biting chill when he looked at this young man.</p>

    <p>So Fan Xing frowned again and said, "General Director Zhuo is also the senior of my Sun Rong junior schoolmate. This great master came out of nowhere?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>Fan</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Fan Xing felt that his body was getting colder and colder for some reason.</p>

    <p>He snorted and stood up from the sofa. He glanced at the maids and said, "I seem to have caught a cold. I'm going back to my room first. Make me a bowl of ginger soup and prepare a typhoid recovery pill for me." Otherwise don't ask for a tip!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, the young man left with a few bodyguards in black and arrogance on his face.</p>

    <p>"Senior...you won't do anything?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi can't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao's voice was cold: "The timer has started. In less than 24 hours, he will be sent to the hospital..."</p>

    <p>Previously, Heavenly Dao did have the urge to stare Fan Xing to death with one glance.</p>

    <p>His eyes are: Heavenly Dao·Direct Gaze·Devil Eye of Death...</p>

    <p>As long as you activate the force and stare at a person for more than 10 seconds, the person will die immediately.</p>

    <p>However, due to Fan Xing's continued provocation, Heavenly Dao changed his mind.</p>

    <p>Just stare this guy to death. It's a bit too easy on him...</p>

    <p>Being half dead is the greatest torture.</p>

    <p>In the mental space. Sun Rong asked curiously: "Senior. What will happen to my cousin?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "Don't worry, Miss Sun. He won't die. But this life is over."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed: "I didn't expect him to be so vicious."</p>

    <p>As soon as Fan Xing left, Aunt Qiu naturally apologized.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing has been staying here for the past two days, which has given her a headache.</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu: "I made you two laugh.</p>

    <p>It's my fault. I shouldn't have let him in in the first place. "It's okay, Aunt Qiu. Such people will naturally have their retribution." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fan Xing felt uncomfortable all over when he returned to the room.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. It's getting colder and colder.</p>

    <p>He was lying on the bed in the guest room. His body went limp. He felt like he had lost all his strength.</p>

    <p>"Oops. The young master seems to have a fever. Go ask the private doctor in the villa to come and take a look."</p>

    <p>"No. I've inquired before... This private doctor has also been transferred to the hospital for a meeting to discuss."</p>

    <p>Several accompanying bodyguards were discussing.</p>

    <p>"What nonsense are you talking about! Why don't you rush those maids when you have the time!" Fan Xing shouted in a low voice. After hearing this, several bodyguards stepped back and left the room.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fan Xing was the only one left in the room.</p>

    <p>Murderous intent. Coming quietly...</p>

    <p>His head rested on the pillow.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Fan Xing feels that today's pillow seems to be particularly soft.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes and rested for a while.</p>

    <p>However, not long after, the young man began to feel a sense of stuffiness.</p>

    <p>He felt that his breathing was starting to become difficult.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Fan Xing suddenly jumped up from the bed like a dying salted fish!</p>

    <p>"What...is going on?"</p>

    <p>Then he was surprised to find out.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when the pillow actually got a big hole!</p>

    <p>All the loose cotton wool flowed into his nostrils and mouth!</p>

    <p>"Bah, bah, bah... ugh..."</p>

    <p>Try to dig out the foreign objects in your mouth and nose.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing knelt on the ground. He stared at the ground and dug out the clumps of cotton wool soaked with his saliva and nose from his mouth and nose.</p>

    <p>The strange sight in front of him made him feel frightened.</p>

    <p>He realized he couldn't stay alone in the room any longer!</p>

    <p>"Come on! Come on!" he shouted.</p>

    <p>However, there was no movement at all outside the guest room door.</p>

    <p>The bodyguards were scolded by him and sent away to urge the maids to prepare soup. No one was left to guard him...</p>

    <p>"Damn it!" Fan Xing gritted his teeth. He threw himself on the door and angrily turned the door handle.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>A loud sound!</p>

    <p>The entire handle was twisted off by him.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>However, the young man didn't realize why he could unscrew the bedroom door handle so easily.</p>

    <p>A screw on the door suddenly fell down at this moment and rolled down to the young man's feet.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing was in a trance and didn't even notice the situation under his feet. He stepped on the screws with his bare feet.</p>

    <p>The severe pain came instantly!</p>

    <p>Access the whole body!</p>

    <p>Amidst the screams, the young man lost his balance.</p>

    <p>While stumbling, I saw myself about to hit the edge of the bed!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing used the last of his strength to instill spiritual energy into the top of his head!</p>

    <p>Strengthened the hardness of my head!</p>

    <p>The next moment, his "iron head" hit the edge of the bed.</p>

    <p>The huge impact caused the entire bed to be lifted up. Thomas completed a perfect 360° full rotation in the air and then pressed heavily on his lower body...</p>

    <p>"Master! The medicine is here!"</p>

    <p>The bodyguard has rushed back. He is holding medicine in his hand.</p>

    <p>Hearing the movement inside the door, he quickly kicked the door in and said, "Master, what's wrong with you!"</p>

    <p>The bedroom door was kicked open, like a spinning guillotine, hitting Fan Xing directly on the top of his head.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the bedroom was filled with blood...</p>
