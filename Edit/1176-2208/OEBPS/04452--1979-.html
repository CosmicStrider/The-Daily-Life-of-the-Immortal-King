  <h1>Chapter 1979 The genius disciple sent by heaven</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Today's visibility on the streets of Songhai City is frighteningly low. In some areas, air traffic control and traffic suspension announcements have been issued.</p>

    <p>A man carrying a guzheng bag, wearing round sunglasses and a gray cotton coat was walking on the street. He looked calmly at the pedestrians walking around wearing masks. Then he sighed slightly and shook his head.</p>

    <p>The mist condensed by mana is very clean. In fact, there is no pollution problem.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that today's young people lack common sense. They seem to be afraid that their spiritual roots will be polluted and affect their cultivation...</p>

    <p>However, the modern world of cultivation is completely different from the past. In modern cultivation society, people often say that only when you enter the Golden Core can you truly begin the path of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Because under the modern cultivation system and the realm before Golden Core, the price of the elixir used to break through the bottleneck has almost reached the point where even ordinary people can afford it.</p>

    <p>If resources are equal, all that remains is to look at talent. If talent is good enough, you can generally become a Golden Core cultivator before entering college.</p>

    <p>But obviously, not everyone has such self-knowledge.</p>

    <p>"The weather forecast is getting increasingly inaccurate! What should I do if such a severe haze has polluted my children's spiritual roots?"</p>

    <p>"This city is really harmful to people! It's killing people!"</p>

    <p>A bejeweled middle-aged woman held the hand of a little boy less than five years old while walking hurriedly on the road.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that this is a mother who is in a hurry to send her child to kindergarten.</p>

    <p>She cursed and complained.</p>

    <p>The man in Mao suit stood still. It wasn't until the middle-aged woman passed by cursing that he let out a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>The life of seclusion in the mountains and forests is indeed more suitable for him. Modern cultivators...especially those living in fast-paced metropolises have really bad tempers.</p>

    <p>The scene just now made Luo Lan a little panicked.</p>

    <p>He rarely sets foot in the city. Because he has severe social phobia, he will feel uncomfortable as soon as he enters the city.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he used secret techniques to create this foggy scene. In such fog, it was his best protective color.</p>

    <p>But this time, Luo Lan did not hesitate to go out and come to Songhai City. In fact, it was related to a magic ball that was anonymously sent to him.</p>

    <p>The man obviously knew that he was not good at operating modern technology, so he burned the video in the orb for him to watch.</p>

    <p>It was a video of a dense forest.</p>

    <p>In the video, Luo Lan recognized at a glance the person who was known as a high school student genius across the country, Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>When he first watched the video, Luo Lan was a little confused. But when he looked at him, his eyes were immediately attracted to the young man fighting Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>He actually used the art of mist-resolving...</p>

    <p>Looking at the magic ball, Luo Lan was horrified.</p>

    <p>He has never accepted a disciple, and he has never taught the art of mist-resolving to others.</p>

    <p>But this young man directly understood the highest state of the mist-resolving art "Water Mist Mirror Flower" by his own efforts.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>At that moment!</p>

    <p>Luo Lan was moved.</p>

    <p>Mist spell is a very idiosyncratic spell. It has the same origin as water spell but is different in form. It is very difficult to control.</p>

    <p>Those who are proficient in water magic may not be proficient in fog magic. But those who are proficient in fog magic must have top-notch water magic abilities.</p>

    <p>It took him decades to come into contact with the art of Mist Removal. It took him another few decades to practice the Mist Removal Art to the highest level.</p>

    <p>Now, a boy who is only seventeen years old can actually have such an amazing talent. How can Luo Lan not be moved?</p>

    <p>So here he comes.</p>

    <p>Even though he has complete social phobia.</p>

    <p>But in order to accept this "genius" as his disciple, he decided to take the risk and set foot in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>But in this vast big city, finding someone is like finding a needle in a haystack, so how easy is it?</p>

    <p>If there is no one to guide him, no matter how long he stays here, it will be useless.</p>

    <p>Therefore, before coming to Songhai City, Luo Lan made some preparations. He used the most primitive communication method, flying sword to pass letters, to contact a young Taoist friend he had met many years ago...</p>

    <p>It is said that this man is doing well in the city recently. Maybe he can help.</p>

    <p>Venus Moon Tower.</p>

    <p>This is the tallest landmark building in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>Under the hazy mist, Luo Lan appeared in front of the Venus Moon Tower.</p>

    <p>Soon, a familiar voice came from afar.</p>

    <p>"A broken heart..."</p>

    <p>Luo Lan raised his head in surprise and responded to the code: "Where is the world...looking for a soulmate!"</p>

    <p>"Master Luo Lan, the hero of the city, has come from afar. I am disrespectful."</p>

    <p>The curly-haired young man came from a distance with a smile on his face. Then he took the initiative to shake hands with Luo Lan and said, "I'm Zhuo Yi. I've been waiting here for Master Luo Lan for a long time."</p>

    <p>Luo Lan looked at Zhuo Yi's hand. He took a deep breath. Then he tried to hold it. But he only touched it briefly. Zhuo Yi didn't even shake Luo Lan's hand. It slipped out of his hand like a fish.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is not stupid. After so many years of working experience, he has seen all kinds of people. His ability to observe words and emotions tells him that the master Luo Lan in front of him is probably a senior patient with social phobia.</p>

    <p>Uh. Why do there seem to be quite a lot of people he knows who are socially afraid?</p>

    <p>Take his master as an example. Isn't he just a typical social phobia patient...</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I'm here to disturb fellow Taoist Zhuo Yi." Luo Lan said politely.</p>

    <p>"No, no. Master, you're welcome. Just call me Zhuo Yi." Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>In fact, his meeting with Zhuo Yi was a little awkward.</p>

    <p>He met Zhuo Yi when the fifth-level demon king Tuntian Ha came to Songhai City many years ago.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, he was selected as a city hero together with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>However, because he was too scared and ashamed to appear in the media, when he received the award, Zhuo Yi picked it up on his behalf and then mailed it to him.</p>

    <p>Since then, he has had no contact with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>So much so that now he doesn't even know what Zhuo Yi does. He just heard that Zhuo Yi is a very distinguished person in the local area.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Luo Lan actually felt a little ashamed.</p>

    <p>Sometimes relationships still need to be maintained by oneself.</p>

    <p>He usually never greets Zhuo Yi during holidays. Now when something happens, he thinks of Zhuo Yi. It is actually a bit shameless.</p>

    <p>This kind of behavior is actually no different from those old classmates who have not been in contact for 800 years and ask you to borrow money as soon as they contact you...</p>

    <p>Of course. Luo Lan is an introspective person.</p>

    <p>He has his own thoughts in his mind.</p>

    <p>Now, Zhuo Yi came to help him regardless of past grudges. This friendship made Luo Lan deeply moved.</p>

    <p>"Fellow Daoist Zhuo is so polite. This huge crowd... if I hadn't been unfamiliar with this place, I wouldn't have the shame to ask for help from Daoist Zhuo," Luo Lan said.</p>

    <p>"Master Luo Lan is very thirsty for talents. Of course I understand that."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "In addition, I have found the person you are looking for."</p>

    <p>"So fast?"</p>

    <p>This is a first-tier metropolis...</p>

    <p>Just by relying on the clues in the video, he could accurately find the student who fought against Qu Shuling. This made Luo Lan stunned by Zhuo Yi's interpersonal skills.</p>

    <p>"Does Master Luo Lan want to investigate in secret? Or go to him directly?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Please, Fellow Taoist Zhuo, please take me there directly. Time will not wait for me." Luo Lan bowed to Zhuo Yi respectfully and said sincerely.</p>
