  <h1>Chapter 2044 Wang Ling vs Decay and Fengnian</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: When the long-dormant Xifengnian was reactivated by the forbidden curse of the Sun family's ancestor, the faint power of the bloodline of the alien gods immediately attracted the great attention of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The destruction of the Outer Gods preceded those of eternity. Those who can be infected with the blood of the Outer Gods. There is undoubtedly only one answer. That is, the dead and rich years must have broken into the Palace of the Outer Gods back then.</p>

    <p>And therefore, those inside received part of the inheritance from the outer gods.</p>

    <p>The mere fact that he was able to walk out of the palace of the outer gods was enough to prove the extraordinary qualities of Xifengnian.</p>

    <p>After all, there are only a few people who can break into it and come out. It is basically impossible for anyone to have the leisurely experience of strolling in the garden in the palace of the outer gods like Wang Ling. The vast majority of people are buried inside after entering.</p>

    <p>Only a handful of people can come out alive, not because of their strong strength, but because they are favored by the will of the alien gods, making this group of cultivators their affiliates to continue to spread the Heavenly Dao tradition in the world of human cultivation.</p>

    <p>However, the human body is still weaker than the outer gods. Therefore, the will of the palace of the outer gods will definitely be selected from the best. And only a very small part of the power of the Taoism will be passed down.</p>

    <p>If all the cells are transplanted, the successor will die on the spot if they can no longer bear it. But the transplant will pass little by little, and they will continue to be cultured and reproduced in the body over time. In the end, the foreign system will be completely inherited.</p>

    <p>But in this way, the time span is very long. It is impossible to inherit the complete Heavenly Dao tradition without tens of millions of years.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Ru felt that Xifengnian was more terrifying than the legend. Just looking at him like that, a chilling aura permeated from his whole body.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A black light rushed out from Xufengnian's body, directly opening up a piece of heaven and earth. An independent space in another world was formed on the spot.</p>

    <p>This space is located above the big world. It is the highest world. A space of endless darkness.</p>

    <p>In the dark purple sky, the black clouds are very low, as if they will collapse at any time. The wind is howling here, and there is no light. If you look closely, your whole spirit will collapse.</p>

    <p>Because those densely packed in the deep purple sky are slightly invisible purple pupils. They are densely packed with the whole world, and together they focus their attention here.</p>

    <p>The last time Wang Ling entered the Supreme World was when he fought against Fenmu Shen. Normal cultivators would never be able to summon the Supreme World.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Xianfengnian is much more powerful than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru's knees have become weak. In such a supreme world, the fighting instinct of the young and delicate Sun family has no effect at all.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Wang Ling quickly took her into his core world to avoid the sharp edge brought by the supreme world of decay and abundance.</p>

    <p>"Master, be careful! He has become more terrifying than the legend! He must have become stronger while sleeping." Sun Ru said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heartily agrees with this view.</p>

    <p>Although Xuefengnian was suppressed and "trained" into a puppet by the ancestor of the Sun family, the bloodline of the Outer Gods he inherited was indeed genuine.</p>

    <p>For the founder of the Sun family back then, perhaps the suppression was really just a helpless move. He used this method because he had no means to really kill Xufengnian.</p>

    <p>However, during such a long period of time, even in a state of suppression, the solid outer god cells in his body were still helping him move closer to a complete outer Heavenly Dao system.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling is like Tang Monk who unlocked the Wuzhishan talisman for Sun Wukong, allowing Xianfengnian to emerge from the suppressed state effortlessly.</p>

    <p>Of course. In fact, Wang Ling also has an intuition.</p>

    <p>That is, the decadent harvest is actually intentional.</p>

    <p>With such strength, even if you rely on yourself, it won't be difficult to ask the Sun family's ancestor to suppress you.</p>

    <p>But Xifengnian did not do that.</p>

    <p>"I was waiting for you on purpose."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying also had an insight into Xifeng Nian's intention. He couldn't help but sneered: "To be able to knock down the gate of the Immortal Palace is definitely not a good thing. He must think that he is very strong. He has no interest in the weak."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>The voice of Xianfengnian suddenly sounded. It was cold and ruthless: "I have been waiting for so long. Finally, someone interested me..."</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The black light leaped. A strong sense of oppression was conveyed on Xufengnian's body. He stepped out with an astonishing aura. In this black and supreme world, all the eyes of insight in the sky were monitoring Wang Ling from all directions. Every action.</p>

    <p>"I hope you can last a little longer."</p>

    <p>He moved directly sideways, almost sticking to Wang Ling. His silver-white eyes were filled with arrogance and indifference. He wrapped the shackles on his hands around Wang Ling's neck.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling's body disintegrated like the wind directly in front of him.</p>

    <p>Xufengnian's face became even more excited. After all, the man in front of him was still standing after being pulled into the "Dark Place" of the highest world. Normal cultivators would have long been unable to bear the mental pressure and fell to their knees.</p>

    <p>Today's Xufengnian is very confident in his own strength. Even if the ancestor of the Sun family comes again, it will be impossible to defeat him.</p>

    <p>You must also kneel down in his supreme world and bow your head to him.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The next second. The fierce battle begins.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned into a golden light. It collided with the black aurora that was the incarnation of the decadent harvest year. The collision between the two produced a bright flame. It was like the celestial body in the universe cracking apart.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru and Immortal Toya were both dumbfounded. This was a battle at a level far beyond what they could understand. Every move seemed to reconstruct their world view.</p>

    <p>Just a few seconds of back and forth collision. It was already more than ten times!</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng, as the sage of Buddhism, also has the supreme world passed down from generation to generation. Even the monk himself received only ten palms from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although I didn't take it too seriously, but faced with the decadent years when I could easily take over my ten palms, Wang Ling really felt that this ancient genius was extraordinary.</p>

    <p>"Tsk. You don't want to fight with the talisman." Wang Ying looked calm. He couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>Although it is just a tentative attack, the immortal Fengnian is indeed stronger than the opponents it has encountered before. Not to mention other attributes. At least the standard of double A in power and speed has definitely been reached.</p>

    <p>"Wait a little longer."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied in his heart.</p>

    <p>The battle may seem intense, but in fact it has just begun for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's rare to encounter a relatively strong opponent. Just lift the talisman and fight. Maybe the battle will be over in a second.</p>

    <p>Duixifengnian. Wang Ling also wants to dig out more secrets about him.</p>

    <p>Since this person has stayed in the ancient tripod for so long without coming out. www.uukanshu.net, then he must know the situation of the Sun family's ancestral land very well.</p>

    <p>In other words, whether the ancestor of the Sun family that he speculated was actually implanted by a soul. Maybe Xifengnian also knows some inside information.</p>

    <p>The next second. Wang Ling's eyes became more serious.</p>

    <p>He opened his eyes. The King's Eyes erupted with bright divine light and illuminated the entire sky. For just a moment, the eyes of insight in this supreme world were swept away by the King's Eyes. All of them closed their eyes...</p>

    <p>A purple downpour fell instantly. It was the dense pupils of the entire supreme world. Blood seeped out from the corners of the eyes.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Xian Feng Nian noticed something strange.</p>

    <p>The power of just one eye actually caused all his eyes of insight in the supreme world to become useless.</p>

    <p>Where does this person come from...</p>
