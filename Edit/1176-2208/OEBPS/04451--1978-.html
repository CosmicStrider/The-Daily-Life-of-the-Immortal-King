  <h1>Chapter 1978 Experimental Version Number 1 Talisman</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Almost less than a few minutes after Wang Ling arrived home, Zhai Yin came to the door at the same time. She came specially to see Talisman off.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling had been holding back in the spirit world. In fact, it was to protect the stability of Talisman. Now Talisman is becoming less and less disabled. The effective sealing time after each replacement is getting shorter. This makes Wang Ling A little worried.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there are still many people who care about him.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin did not disturb Father Wang and Mother Wang. She was dressed like a heroine in night clothes. She climbed directly into Wang Ling's bedroom through the window.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling had already added Zhai Yin to the whitelist in the villa's defense mechanism after returning from Sun Island. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, if outsiders wanted to break into the villa directly through the window, the end would be tragic.</p>

    <p>"Is it okay for you to come here? You are Mr. Ming's bodyguard."</p>

    <p>Er Ha yawned. He squatted at Wang Ling's feet and lazily looked up at Zhai Yin and said.</p>

    <p>"He can protect himself. And I'm not here to save the earth... obviously this is more important."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin said: "This new Talisman has added a little bit of material extracted from the meteorite called Eternity. The lasting effect should be stronger than before."</p>

    <p>"It was extracted and produced so quickly?" Er Ha was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's just test item Number 001. But it is also a necessary test. Otherwise, there will be no subsequent updates on the problem. In addition, because the meteorite is very radioactive, it is necessary to conduct subsequent purification of the radioactive contamination generated during the extraction process. That's why he couldn't come over in person."</p>

    <p>As Zhai Yin spoke, a look of worry began to appear on his face.</p>

    <p>"Any other questions?" Wang Ling asked softly.</p>

    <p>"After all, this is a trial version of Talisman. You may encounter some bugs in the process of posting Talisman...but what the specific problems are. It's hard to say yet."</p>

    <p>As he said that, Zhai Yin took out a jade jar with a seal on it from the storage bag. He handed it to Wang Ling: "The one in the jade jar is the latest version of the regular Talisman. I'll swap it with you." What comes down is the same. No matter what, keep it with you to be prepared. It's always good to be just in case."</p>

    <p>"Thanks."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took it with both hands. Thank you very politely.</p>

    <p>He stared at the smiling Zhai Yin. He was stunned for a few seconds. Then he added in a strange way: "Sister-in-law..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's face immediately turned red.</p>

    <p>She had no idea that Wang Ling would call her that.</p>

    <p>Does this mean...that I have been approved by my brother-in-law?</p>

    <p>For a brief moment, her mind was almost blank, but her body had already reacted unconsciously. Her face was red and she almost turned out of the window as if she was running away.</p>

    <p>Such a true emotional reaction actually makes Wang Ling a little envious.</p>

    <p>Because of Talisman, his emotions are suppressed and difficult to release.</p>

    <p>Even if there is even the slightest fluctuation sometimes, it will calm down quickly.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ming still lived up to his expectations. He soon cooperated with Shou Chong to extract the sealed substance in the eternal stone.</p>

    <p>I just hope that after changing into this experimental version of Talisman, I won't become too weird...</p>

    <p>In front of the bathroom mirror.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Under the protection of Er Ha. He carried out the operation of replacing Talisman on himself.</p>

    <p>The moment the new Talisman covered it, Wang Ling felt an almost suffocating and powerful suppressive force. His eyes turned black in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>This is something that the regular Talisman has never done before.</p>

    <p>A few drops of cold sweat instantly flowed down his forehead.</p>

    <p>This reaction is very similar to hypoglycemia.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is actually Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This duration probably only lasted about three seconds, and then it was relieved immediately.</p>

    <p>Gradually Wang Ling straightened up in front of the mirror.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the suppression power of the experimental version of Talisman surprised him.</p>

    <p>This time, he felt that this experimental version of Talisman should be able to be worn for a long time.</p>

    <p>As for adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Except for the three seconds of discomfort that occurred the moment I put it on, everything else is basically normal at the moment.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling looked at Er Ha. Clenched his fist: "Can you let me punch you?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha's head suddenly broke out in cold sweat: "What's going on? Is this necessary..."</p>

    <p>"I promise to be gentle." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"No! Absolutely not!" Er Ha said rejection written all over his face.</p>

    <p>Although the enhancement effect of the experimental version Number 001 Talisman does look powerful, the person standing in front of him is Wang Ling after all. This punch will not directly kill him.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's boring."</p>

    <p>Seeing Er Ha's frightened eyes. Wang Ling sighed in his heart. In the end, he didn't embarrass Er Ha anymore.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to test how much destructive power he could cause with one hundred millionth of a force after replacing it with the new experimental version of Talisman.</p>

    <p>But now, it seems that this experiment can only be put on hold for the time being.</p>

    <p>"Go to sleep. There isn't much time left. I have to go to class later." Wang Ling complained while lying on the bed.</p>

    <p>The stronger Talisman's suppression, the more peaceful he sleeps. And whether he can quickly enter sleep state is also one of Wang Ling's tests.</p>

    <p>For now, he feels that Talisman has no weird bugs yet. It's pretty good.</p>

    <p>On the other side, at this time, Er Ha opened his mouth in astonishment, looking at Wang Ling who was already lying on the bed, closing his eyes and falling asleep.</p>

    <p>If it heard correctly...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just said a total of four lines.</p>

    <p>Four lines in total!</p>

    <p>And it's still the kind that doesn't use sound transmission technology...</p>

    <p>Is this an illusion?</p>

    <p>Could this be a bug in the experimental version of Talisman?</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha looked at Wang Ling, who had fallen asleep at the speed of light. It's not a reminder. It's not a reminder...</p>

    <p>Because who the hell would have thought of that.</p>

    <p>The bug in this experimental version of Talisman is that the Little Master Lingzi adds lines!</p>

    <p>It won't develop into social nerdiness...</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly had an ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's still Friday, January 17th. Early in the morning.</p>

    <p>The city of Songhai is covered with clouds. The entire city is permeated with mist. It makes people feel like they can't breathe.</p>

    <p>Many people are wearing masks when going out.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling only slept for two hours, the quality of sleep in these two hours was the highest in this month.</p>

    <p>He clearly felt that he was very energetic today.</p>

    <p>If the weather could be better this morning, maybe my mood would be better.</p>

    <p>"Such fog is rare." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling also saw it. This is man-made.</p>

    <p>All the out-of-town students who were forced to leave the spirit world trial site yesterday stayed in the hotel arranged by Jiutian Jingmi Academy to rest.</p>

    <p>So. Li Changzhe did not leave Songhai City yesterday.</p>

    <p>And there is probably no one else but the legendary fog god who can cause such a natural fog to affect the entire city...</p>

    <p>In other words, the Mist God may have arrived in Songhai City at this moment.</p>
