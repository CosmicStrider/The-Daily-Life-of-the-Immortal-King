  <h1>Chapter 1267 A small and ruined temple in a remote area</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It is not uncommon for Heavenly Dao messengers to travel to the lower world. In fact, every year there are messengers transformed from Heavenly Dao little Golden Men into the human world to inspect.</p>

    <p>However, these inspections are relatively free. Any Heavenly Dao Golden Men who have ideas can submit application materials to the Heavenly Dao Committee. After passing the review, they can go to the next level.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao, the main character, is usually busy with official duties. The number of visits to the lower realm is relatively small.</p>

    <p>And this time, the brothers Heavenly Dao went to the lower world especially for one person. This is really the first time.</p>

    <p>At the entrance of the Wang family villa. Zhuo Yi has been waiting for a long time.</p>

    <p>Seeing Death, Heavenly Dao walked out of the door. Zhuo Yi quickly clasped his fists: "I have seen Lord Death..."</p>

    <p>"My brother and I look exactly the same. With your level and strength, how can you tell it's mine?" Death Heavenly Dao was very curious.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said with a bright face: "It's Master. He gave me permission to receive you two adults."</p>

    <p>"Permissions..." Death Heavenly Dao immediately understood.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid this is the role of the {Great Sharing Technique} in Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>There is a branch of this spell called {Knight Contract}, which binds the designated person, thereby allowing the other person to gain part of his power.</p>

    <p>Now. Zhuo Yi was sent out by Wang Ling to do something. He has given Zhuo Yi part of the authority of the other King's Eyes to share.</p>

    <p>However, this authority is only used to distinguish the brothers Heavenly Dao from life to death.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi currently has too much strength. Too many permissions have been granted. The body can easily fall into overload.</p>

    <p>Lead the Death Heavenly Dao on the way to the hospital where Sun Rong is.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi handed the prepared identity document to Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>"Lord Death. Here are your credentials."</p>

    <p>The names above. One is Wang Sheng and the other is Wang Shi. They are very simple and crude.</p>

    <p>When entering the name, the police officer responsible for registering the identity information was also surprised.</p>

    <p>The king is dead...</p>

    <p>There are still people with such unlucky names!</p>

    <p>"I knew my name would be talked about." Heavenly Dao muttered. He accepted his ID card.</p>

    <p>He picked up his brother's ID card and threw it out of the window. The ID card immediately turned into a golden light and flew towards the location of "Wang Sheng."</p>

    <p>"Well. How does Lord Death know what I'm thinking..."</p>

    <p>"Nonsense. I am Heavenly Dao!"</p>

    <p>"oh..."</p>

    <p>"Actually, I also think this name is unlucky. Even if it has a homophonic sound, it's fine. But it's been done, so forget it." Death Heavenly Dao sighed.</p>

    <p>As Death Heavenly Dao. In fact, he does not shy away from death at all.</p>

    <p>In the past, when I went to the lower realm, I always used the pseudonym "Wang Shi."</p>

    <p>But this time after Wang Ling put a sword on his neck. Death Heavenly Dao finally felt the fear of death...</p>

    <p>As expected, there is still something to pay attention to when it comes to naming!</p>

    <p>"How is Miss Sun's current situation?" Death Heavenly Dao asked.</p>

    <p>"Same as the same. The condition keeps coming back and forth. The heartbeat keeps stopping..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi answered truthfully: "There are about forty expert teams gathered in the hospital now. They are all discussing countermeasures."</p>

    <p>"I can't find the reason. What's the use of getting together. This is not a group fight."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao sat in the passenger seat and hummed: "I'll sit next to Miss Sun's bed later! I want to see who the hell dares to do something in front of me."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao used foul language. This should be unprecedented.</p>

    <p>However, it is not entirely unreasonable for Heavenly Dao to be so excited about death.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi understands this feeling very well.</p>

    <p>After all, people will always gain new insights into themselves after experiencing the danger of death.</p>

    <p>And obviously. The same is true for Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A small village in the southern suburbs of Songhai!</p>

    <p>The dusty Spirit Bus drove through the rugged concrete road. A cloud of dust was thrown up in the violent tremors.</p>

    <p>Nantian Village Spirit Bus Station. This old Spirit Bus finally stopped at the roadside. A handsome man with long hair reaching his waist got off the bus. He was dressed in white and had beautiful hair. He was really Lord Diulei himself.</p>

    <p>The clothes you wear when going out are far less formal than when you were in the sect.</p>

    <p>Considering that what I want to see is a Zen monk.</p>

    <p>So Lord Diulei deliberately chose such an extremely simple-looking outfit.</p>

    <p>Nantian Village belongs to the air control area. There is a huge shipyard nearby. Countless aerial immortal ships pass by every day.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when there is a flight ban, Lord Diulei can only come by Spirit Bus.</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei recalled this Dharma name carefully and confirmed that he had never heard it before.</p>

    <p>Based on his experience in the world of cultivation, if there really is such a hidden and strange person, Diulei feels that he will not know about it.</p>

    <p>And on the way, he even asked many friends.</p>

    <p>The result is the same. No one has heard of the name "Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>"I hope this trip will be fruitful." Lord Diulei thought to himself.</p>

    <p>According to the address provided by Dr. Liu Min, Lord Diulei officially entered Nantian Village to look for clues about Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>At the entrance of the village, an old man with his shirt exposed was playing chess alone.</p>

    <p>He was smoking a cigarette. One person played four roles, fighting each other. He was very involved.</p>

    <p>Looking at it from a distance, Lord Diulei thought he had met some divine being.</p>

    <p>Then I walked over and saw that this old man was actually playing Ludo by himself...</p>

    <p>"Sir..." Lord Diulei asked tentatively.</p>

    <p>The old man glanced at Lord Diulei and replied: "Jungle? I haven't been in the jungle for a long time. My teammates are too weak. I can't even lead them in the jungle."</p>

    <p>Helpless. Lord Diulei had to ask the key point: "How to get to Kaiguang Temple?"</p>

    <p>The old man was furious: "Shitless pants? I'm a lot older. Why should I wear crotchless pants? Young man, don't make fun of your uncle!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei supports his forehead.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that as soon as he entered the village, he would meet an "empty-eared demon"...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head in disappointment. He planned to go into the village to find other villagers for clues.</p>

    <p>I heard the old man behind him suddenly say as if his ears were healed again: "If you are going to Kaiguang Temple, go straight in for 800 meters. It is the broken house on the right."</p>

    <p>"Thank you sir."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei crossed his fists and walked away.</p>

    <p>According to the instructions of the uncle Kong'er at the door, he successfully found the broken house that the uncle mentioned.</p>

    <p>The wooden temple door has several rivets missing. There is even a gap on the door. Through the gap, you can see the inside of the temple.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei just wanted to knock on the door.</p>

    <p>Then I heard an old voice coming from inside.</p>

    <p>"The True Lord has come to visit. The small temple is in full bloom. The door is open. True Lord, please come in and talk."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was startled by this sound.</p>

    <p>It seems that Zen Master Jin Deng in the temple had expected his arrival a long time ago?</p>

    <p>He was amazed at the power of this Zen master. He was about to open the door and go in. But he felt that the seemingly shabby door was extremely heavy!</p>

    <p>I only use one hand. I can't push it at all!</p>

    <p>At this time, laughter came from the door again: "I forgot to tell Zhenjun. You have to push the door a little harder. This door has also been opened."</p>
