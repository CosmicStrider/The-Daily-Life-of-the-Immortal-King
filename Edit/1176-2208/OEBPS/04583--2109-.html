  <h1>Chapter 2109 Wall Breaker</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling The person recommended is none other than the famous self-media author of self-media popularization of cultivation science who is very famous on the modern cultivation network. Infinite Xiaoliang teacher... people gave him the nickname: Mr. Hidden Fox.</p>

    <p>Mainly for this Mr. Tibetan Fox. Wang Ming also knows about the existence of this figure. He has never been interested in Internet celebrities who are popular on the Internet. Internet celebrities are popular in self-media, Internet celebrity milk tea Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming feels that anything that has anything to do with the word "Internet celebrity" is more or less disgusting. At least he himself is such a person.</p>

    <p>In a sense, the birth of the Internet celebrity phenomenon is due to the development of the modern information industry on the one hand. On the other hand, it also represents a part of the public's aesthetics.</p>

    <p>But with the intervention of capital, everything has become different. From the beginning, internet celebrities can represent a part of the public's aesthetics as a neutral term. Gradually, they have become more derogatory. Each internet celebrity is selling like hotcakes. Behind the product. God knows if it is an IQ tax scam?</p>

    <p>Those Internet celebrity milk tea shops that hire people to queue up to buy milk tea. Are they really that delicious?</p>

    <p>Are those pills that claim to be able to lose weight without exercise, diet, or lying down really that effective?</p>

    <p>Therefore, as a rigorous scientific researcher, Wang Ming's aversion to such things is almost burned into his DNA.</p>

    <p>But let's talk about it. Wang Ming currently recognizes Shou Chong as one of his top researchers who has been newly recruited... He was also an internet celebrity before.</p>

    <p>So why did Wang Ming open up to Shou Chong?</p>

    <p>I really have to break it down in detail. It seems that it is also because of this Mr. Hidden Fox.</p>

    <p>And the bad relationship between him and Mr. Zanghu completely originated from Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin is his fan.</p>

    <p>I always stay tuned to watch his videos. Like, vote, and add to favorites with one click. Sometimes he even gives a reward of one or two yuan during the live broadcast.</p>

    <p>The amount was not big. But everyone in the Old Wang family knew how to be jealous (only Wang Ming at the time would never admit that he was jealous).</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ming was very curious. Which man could make Zhai Yin admire him so much.</p>

    <p>He doesn't believe in evil. He went to ruin the show with a fault-finding mentality. He also deliberately stayed at the other party's broadcast time several times.</p>

    <p>During various introductions, Wang Ming was already ready to criticize. He was like a black fan. He was just waiting for Mr. Tibetan Fox to make a mistake. Then he immediately typed a message to correct him.</p>

    <p>As a result, when he looked at it later, he found that Mr. Zanghu, an Internet celebrity... was really not an ordinary person. He was actually a person with something special!</p>

    <p>The other party's knowledge reserve was much richer than Wang Ming imagined. He even had deep insights into the history of cultivation in modern and ancient times.</p>

    <p>Then there is no more...</p>

    <p>At first, Wang Ming watched the live broadcast simply because she was jealous and wanted to find fault.</p>

    <p>Later, after he had to admit Mr. Zanghu's knowledge, he simply gave up the resistance and became a fan of Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Now that I think about it carefully, that was when he started to have a vague affection for Zhai Yin. In fact, this incident also reflected the truth of some things.</p>

    <p>In addition, it was also because Zhai Yin paid attention to this "Mr. Zanghu" that Wang Ming got to know more about Mr. Zanghu. And he also began to have a further change in his view of Internet celebrities.</p>

    <p>Everything has two sides. It cannot be generalized.</p>

    <p>And this also laid a foundation for the subsequent addition of Internet celebrity scientist Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>"Life is a circle..." After seeing Wang Ling's recommendation, Wang Ming couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>After knowing that Mr. Zanghu was going to join the "Spiritual Wall Breaking Project", the most excited person was naturally Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>On one side is my boyfriend. On the other side is my idol.</p>

    <p>This is simply a dream collaboration within a dream collaboration!</p>

    <p>"So. Mr. Zanghu will be a key person in the plan?" Zhai Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Not bad." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>Although their big plans are already set.</p>

    <p>The "Spiritual Consciousness Wall Breaking Plan" is basically based on Bai Qiao's game {Itinerant Immortal} which has not yet been released to public beta.</p>

    <p>When Heavenly Dao Yun quietly intervened, Brother Michu inside the wall of spiritual consciousness would also unconsciously enter the preset game world while resting, such as taking a nap, such as sleeping. They were trapped. Within the wall of spiritual consciousness. Therefore, it is also called the "wall-facer."</p>

    <p>Therefore, in order to break the wall of spiritual consciousness, there needs to be a key person to guide you!</p>

    <p>This person must have enough knowledge and eloquence to convince these people to follow his instructions and guidance and realize the plan step by step.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Mr. Zanghu is indeed the most suitable person as this key person.</p>

    <p>That's right. Mr. Zanghu, who is now the key person, also has a very important mission code name - Wall Breaker!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base, Mr. Zanghu was secretly invited here. During the entire process, he was put on a special eyepatch and was guided into the underground laboratory on the same floor as Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The existence of the causal base is top secret. Therefore, even if Mr. Zanghu is invited by the plan, careful protection must be implemented.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu was very cooperative throughout the whole process.</p>

    <p>He remained silent. He didn't even ask where he was going and why he was wearing a special eyepatch.</p>

    <p>Because the party that asked him to participate in this "Spiritual Wall Breaking Plan" through the "Wall Breaker" action is Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance was actually able to find him...</p>

    <p>At that time, Mr. Zanghu was all stunned.</p>

    <p>And this matter is genuine. Because the first place he went to was the Huaxiu Alliance headquarters. He also saw with his own eyes the legendary leader of the ten generals, Baoxing.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at that time, Mr. Zanghu knew very clearly that this plan was a top secret of Huaxiu Alliance. He was a smart man. Since it was a top secret, it should not be something he knew. He should not have asked more questions. Otherwise, the other party would definitely I will tell myself in advance.</p>

    <p>At present, the mission that Mr. Zanghu has learned about is probably in the form of a holographic game. Let the stubborn and stubborn monks in the game take the initiative to break open the thick and high wall in the game world.</p>

    <p>As long as a hole is made in the wall. No matter how big or small the hole is, his mission will be considered a success!</p>

    <p>And once the wall is destroyed, it means that...the monks' thinking will become clearer and they will no longer be deceived by false information.</p>

    <p>In the opinion of Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>There is also some philosophical thinking in this.</p>

    <p>You are willing to live in a constructed world of lies forever.</p>

    <p>Or do you want to face the real world?</p>

    <p>Finally, Mr. Zanghu was brought to a holographic cabin in the Karma Base. This was the same cabin developed by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>At this time, his blindfold was also taken off.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhai Yin, and Shou Chong each wore a mask. They stood in front of him wearing lab coats.</p>

    <p>"Can I just lie down in it?" Mr. Zanghu asked.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zanghu, you have to take the pill." Zhai Yin suppressed his excitement and spread his hands and said.</p>

    <p>In her hand. There is a blue pill and a red pill.</p>

    <p>This is a mental stabilization capsule developed by Wang Ming through the divine brain. It has also undergone the latest version of the enlightenment technique from Wang Ling. After all, Shou Chong's consciousness will be directly connected to the Heavenly Dao cloud. With a mortal body. I'm afraid there will be risks.</p>

    <p>After swallowing the capsule, he can temporarily cut off the extra pressure caused by the cosmic miracle Heavenly Dao cloud on him.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu felt that this scene was a bit familiar. He couldn't help laughing: "So. If I take this blue pill, I will see the false world. If I take this red pill, I will see the real world?"</p>

    <p>"No. Mr. Zanghu."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied: "There is no difference between these two pills. It's just that one is blueberry flavored and the other is strawberry flavored. You can choose the flavor you like."</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu: "..."</p>
