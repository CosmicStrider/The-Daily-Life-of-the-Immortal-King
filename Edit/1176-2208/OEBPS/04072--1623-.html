  <h1>Chapter 1623 Horror Story</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What kind of experience is it for four people to squeeze under one bed? Jiugong Liangzi didn't know this before.</p>

    <p>Now. She knows...</p>

    <p>Because Jiang Yingying's bed is not wide enough, it can only fit two adults at most.</p>

    <p>So the situation under the bed now is like this.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Junko Zhongchun are lying at the bottom. This is the first floor.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui and Jiugong Liangzi were lying on their backs respectively.</p>

    <p>The picture is so beautiful that it once made people afraid to look directly at it.</p>

    <p>The four of them have decided one after another that they will never tell this matter to anyone.</p>

    <p>"Senior Li Xian...what are you doing here?" Jiugong Liangzi didn't know Zhang Zhui. But he still knew Li Xian. She had heard before that Li Xian was the person sent by Sun Rong. The great hero who helped the Jiugong family tide over the difficulties.</p>

    <p>Therefore, she respected Li Xian very much. She didn't expect that Li Xian's behavior today would surprise her.</p>

    <p>Li Xian's face turned red. Although he had ten thousand reasons in his mind to explain that things were not what Jiugong Liangzi thought, but now he knew that his image in Jiugong Liangzi's mind was probably ruined.</p>

    <p>"No need to explain. Senior Li Xian, I understand everything." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"..." Li Xian.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiugong Liangzi's current situation is actually not very good.</p>

    <p>Because Junko Zhongchun was placed underneath her, she felt that the upper body area seemed to be particularly crowded.</p>

    <p>"Junko. Don't raise your upper body." Jiugong Liangzi said secretly.</p>

    <p>Junko Zhongchun replied with an innocent look: "Miss. I really didn't raise my upper body on purpose..."</p>

    <p>In an instant, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>She seemed to know something. She gritted her teeth and said, "Are you giving me a hint? Or showing off?"</p>

    <p>"No...no miss..." Junko Zhongchun was helpless.</p>

    <p>She clearly didn't raise her upper body intentionally. It wasn't her fault.</p>

    <p>But this posture now really makes Jiugong Liangzi feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Junko Zhongchun is also very guilty about this.</p>

    <p>After thinking carefully, she quietly sent a message and replied: "Miss, why don't we change positions? Anyway, you are flatter. It will be more comfortable down there."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi clenched his fist instantly and pinched Junko Zhongchun's buttocks hard: "If you dare to scream, you will be dead!"</p>

    <p>"Miss...I..." Junko Zhongchun suppressed his blush. At the same time, he felt aggrieved. He also felt that Jiugong Liangzi was pinching him quite comfortably.</p>

    <p>It looks like a lot of force was used.</p>

    <p>But she is in the Nascent Soul stage. In fact, it doesn't hurt at all. Instead, it feels very comfortable. It feels like acupuncture.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi pinched him for a while. He noticed that Junko Zhongchun looked like he was enjoying himself. He suddenly felt bad all over.</p>

    <p>She pinched Junko Zhongchun's face hard and said fiercely: "I will teach you a lesson when I get back!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, there was complete silence in Jiang Yingying's room. A new door opened again.</p>

    <p>It was an unfamiliar breath. Judging from the results of spiritual perception.</p>

    <p>This person has never been seen by the four people under the bed.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi shared vision through the spirit ghost arranged in the corner of the room and saw the appearance of the visitor.</p>

    <p>This man has his face covered. Judging from his body shape, he is a man with a strong figure.</p>

    <p>There is a slight sleazyness in his temperament. You can tell at a glance that he is not a good person.</p>

    <p>Really.</p>

    <p>Just after Jiugong Liangzi made this judgment, the wretched masked man took off his mask.</p>

    <p>He has an ordinary appearance. He is the kind of popular face that will be lost in the crowd at a glance.</p>

    <p>The only distinctive feature is a hairy black mole on his chin.</p>

    <p>He seems to be talking to someone. And he was talking very loudly. There was no concern that Jiang Yingying would be woken up. Suddenly he looked as if he was awakening: "I didn't realize that high school girls are so easy to fool these days. Boss, don't worry. I'll bring her back to you."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Jiugong Liangzi raised his forehead on the spot.</p>

    <p>Fortunately Sun Rong called her and asked her to come over and take a look.</p>

    <p>This girl is too careless.</p>

    <p>Without the slightest defense. She fell asleep and was devoured without even realizing it!</p>

    <p>Three steps to the bed. The man with the mole lifts the covers. He found Jiang Yingying sleeping soundly. He was stunned by the sweetness of her sleeping face.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds of silence. The man with the mole swallowed his saliva: "Boss... This Sun girl is too beautiful. It's a shame to break her up."</p>

    <p>When the person on the other side of the phone heard this, he couldn't help laughing on the spot: "This is the last vote. This vote is done. We can never have to do it for the rest of our lives. So-called. Anyway, this girl is gullible just to compete with others." My folk remedy that can improve combat power in a short period of time ended up screwing me up. Anyway, it's still early. You can use her."</p>

    <p>"Okay! Okay! Thank you, boss!"</p>

    <p>"Is half an hour enough for you? I want you to bring her over within the agreed time."</p>

    <p>"That's enough, that's enough!" The rogue man nodded repeatedly, wiping his own saliva as he spoke.</p>

    <p>When the four people under the bed heard this, they understood instantly.</p>

    <p>Sorry, this is another group of people who mistook Jiang Yingying for Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>In fact, she didn't think there was much similarity between Jiang Yingying and Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Especially after getting to know the two people thoroughly and knowing their personalities well, Jiugong Liangzi will not have the illusion that the two people look alike.</p>

    <p>In addition to the silver-skinned man last time, this is already the second wave of people admitting their mistakes...</p>

    <p>This man, and the man among the aliens. Could it be that all of them are blind...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the ruthless man once again let out a burst of evil laughter: "Miss Sun, I have offended you. I have been a virgin for hundreds of years. I will dedicate it to you today!"</p>

    <p>He was just about to throw himself on the bed.</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, Li Xian's Zhang Zhui had already teleported behind him. One of them grabbed his shoulders.</p>

    <p>Then, a crisp sound like firecrackers came from the man's left and right arms.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui both held back. They didn't rip off each arm. Otherwise the spilled blood would have stained Jiang Yingying's house.</p>

    <p>They just used their strength to crush the bones in the man's arms.</p>

    <p>The movement was so fast that Jiugong Liangzi was stunned.</p>

    <p>And when Jiugong Liangzi came out from under the bed, he felt goosebumps all over his body when he faced the rogue man in front of him: ""Perverted... so perverted! Junko. Come on!"</p>

    <p>As Jiugong Liangzi's female bodyguard for so many years, Junko Zhongchun started from a female perspective. This attack seemed to be much more ruthless than Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>She opened her arms like a hawk and instantly grasped the vital part of this rogue man. A painful scream resounded throughout the room.</p>

    <p>This move, "Egg Yolk and Egg White Separate Hands", is her secret weapon against wolves.</p>

    <p>"..." Li Xian and Zhang Zhui felt pain just looking at them.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the scoundrel man's miserable scream was too shrill, which finally alerted Jiang Yingying in the deep water.</p>

    <p>Her brows twitched slightly. Then she slowly opened her eyes.</p>

    <p>Right in front of her window.</p>

    <p>Counting the man Li Xian was carrying, who was frothing at the mouth and passed out, there were five people in total. They formed a circle around her bed and looked directly at her with what they thought were kind eyes...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next day.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was sent to the hospital for psychological treatment.</p>

    <p>Lying on the bed next to her is Yi Zhiyang, who was not completely cured last time...</p>
