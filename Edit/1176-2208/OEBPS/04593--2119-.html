  <h1>Chapter 2119 What should I do if I have more and more identities?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Wang Ling never expected that I would inherit a brand new identity [General Chen of Fuyun Town]. The abbreviation is: [General]...</p>

    <p>He stared at the general's armor in front of him and lost in thought. Now he is both a general and a prison chief. This kind of start is dreamy enough and magical enough.</p>

    <p>It was so magical that the old hole in Wang Ling's heart was stuck in his heart like a bath of blood and he couldn't let it go. He didn't know what to use to describe his mood at this moment. The ellipses flying through his heart could circle the earth several times.</p>

    <p>But what exactly is this [hidden mission]?</p>

    <p>You won't really let him raise a child...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is panicking.</p>

    <p>Although, the current Wang Ling is not inexperienced in raising babies. After all, Ah Nuan girl is still at home. When he is at home, he often takes his sister with him to change Ah Nuan girl's diapers and feed Ah Nuan girl. milk powder.</p>

    <p>The little girl is very good at acting coquettishly. She obviously knows everything, but she can't walk when she sees Wang Ling. She likes to cling to him.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, I actually enjoy the feeling of being an older brother.</p>

    <p>He always thought that he was a "monster" with no emotions. But it wasn't until he met Sun Rong, Chen Chao, Guo Hao... that he finally understood what a friend is.</p>

    <p>Now, he has Ah Nuan girl again. Naturally, he understands the magical power brought by blood relationship. He confirms that he is not a monster without emotions. It is just because of the seal that most of his emotions are suppressed. state. This puts him in sage mode all the time.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Ah Nuan girl is a special existence.</p>

    <p>Because in Wang Nuan, Wang Ling can transcend Talisman's emotional limitations. I can truly feel my love for Wang Nuan on a blood level.</p>

    <p>Just for now...</p>

    <p>These eighteen babies are still too many...</p>

    <p>I was stunned. The system prompt came again.</p>

    <p>[System: You have received the limited time task]</p>

    <p>[Within 3 days of game time, eighteen children were successfully taught spells of level 3 or above. Additional hidden task rewards will be obtained]</p>

    <p>"A limited time mission..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look at the task. It seemed that the task was not difficult at all.</p>

    <p>He felt helpless. "With tears", he picked up all the relics of General Chen in Fuyun Town. General Chen's body also disappeared with it.</p>

    <p>In addition to the dropped two pieces of more advanced equipment, the Fuyun Town General Chen's Tiger Helmet (green) and the Fuyun Town General Chen's Tiger Head Armor (blue). Wang Ling also found a piece of equipment from General Chen's relics. A General Huwei mask (purple) that can cover the entire face.</p>

    <p>He is indeed a general-level figure. He actually drops purple equipment directly...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>He put all the relics of General Chen into the inventory. He did not directly change into the general uniform. Instead, he put on the mask of General Huwei in addition to the blank equipment of the prison head.</p>

    <p>This piece of purple equipment directly brings an extra 50 points of strength and defense attributes to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In addition, the blood volume has also been increased by 500 points on this basis.</p>

    <p>At this time, the total health bar of Wang Ling has reached 1500.</p>

    <p>This is an ordinary start for novice players. A height that is difficult to reach...</p>

    <p>He has no interest in three wives and four concubines. He is a little interested in raising children...but he doesn't have much confidence in raising eighteen children. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is still very curious. If he completes the task, what kind of reward will the system arrange for himself.</p>

    <p>You say that curiosity killed the cat. Wang Ling has actually suffered many losses in being a curious baby. But there is no way...Humans are originally creatures that are keen on exploration.</p>

    <p>What's more, the current identity of [General] has already given Wang Ling a perfect start.</p>

    <p>In addition to the entire remote General's Mansion in Fuyun Town, it also means that Wang Ling controls the military power of the entire Fuyun Town. Although the overall quality of the soldiers in Fuyun Town is not high when looking at the entire game world, as long as there are He is training these soldiers into a tiger and wolf division. It shouldn't be difficult.</p>

    <p>So when I thought of this, Wang Ling was relieved. These eighteen children were just doing exercises before being trained as soldiers.</p>

    <p>Wearing the mask of General Hu Might, Wang Ling looked at the follower beside him.</p>

    <p>The system displays the name of this NPC: Liu Jun.</p>

    <p>"Liu Jun. Bring the children."</p>

    <p>"Back to the general. Apart from the seventeenth and eighteenth young masters just now, only the twelfth young master is in the house at the moment."</p>

    <p>Are there only three people at home...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a moment. Then he quickly understood.</p>

    <p>After all, these are the children of generals. They have lived a privileged life since they were young. They live in a wealthy environment and live a free and carefree life. Their love of playing must have been a habit for a long time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what the basic cultivation talents of these 18 children are. But after all, this is just a game. It is not a real person. Their cultivation talents are all set by the system.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling wants to complete is a hidden mission. That means teaching these 18 children third-level spells. There is definitely still a certain degree of difficulty.</p>

    <p>So no matter how many people are at home at the moment, Wang Ling plans to first see how talented the children in this general's mansion are.</p>

    <p>He observed Seventeen and Eighteen who were standing in the yard. Then he chose to click on their attribute panels. The pale attributes really surprised Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>With such attribute values, it can almost be said that there is no cultivation talent at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what the situation is like with other children. But if they are all in the same situation as these two, then it can be said that this general's mansion is completely extinct.</p>

    <p>But there's no harm in cultivating talented people. After all, he's still here. With a little training, there should be a bright future.</p>

    <p>"Bring Twelve."Wang Ling took a deep breath and said to Liu Jun beside him without saying a word.</p>

    <p>After saying that, Liu Jun shouted at the top of his lungs. A bald man as strong as a mountain ran out from the backyard.</p>

    <p>The floor tiles under his feet shook and loosened as he ran. They floated upward slightly, and then fell back to the ground again.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this is a heavyweight figure. Wang Ling originally thought that this was an entourage from some general's palace.</p>

    <p>When he saw Liu Jun standing in front of him respectfully, he bowed deeply and said, "Go back to the general. The twelfth son has been brought here."</p>

    <p>At this point. www.uukanshu.net Wang Ling took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>He doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>Why are Seventeen and Eighteen just kids...but this Twelve Young Master is actually so big.</p>

    <p>"How old?" Wang Ling asked casually.</p>

    <p>"Eight years old." Liu Jun replied respectfully.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>What the hell is this eight years old?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mouth twitches</p>

    <p>"General, have you forgotten? The Twelve Young Master is suffering from a serious illness. He developed prematurely. He is born with an aging constitution. That's why he behaves like an adult."</p>

    <p>After Liu Jun finished speaking, he sighed: "General, your memory is too bad."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
