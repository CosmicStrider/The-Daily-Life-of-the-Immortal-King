  <h1>Chapter 1920 Hello classmate Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Su Xingyue's gaze swept over everyone here. Wang Ling found traces of blue fragments of light streaking across her pupils.</p>

    <p>If you look carefully, you can see that it is a series of data rolling in her eyes.</p>

    <p>This is not an electronic eye or some kind of pupil technique. It is a scientific magic weapon developed by Shengke. It is a multi-functional scanning contact lens. It can be used to detect terrain or detect combat power.</p>

    <p>Magical weapons are originally one of the key elements for cultivators to improve their combat effectiveness. Therefore, having magic weapons on your body does not count as cheating.</p>

    <p>This is also true in some competitions.</p>

    <p>As long as there are no restrictions, it is a directional duel competition that must use physical skills or designated spells.</p>

    <p>Under normal free play conditions.</p>

    <p>If you take out a 400-meter sword, no one would dare to object. As long as you can control it, it will be fine.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue was using her Shengke contact lens to scan the combat power of everyone here. After learning the exact data, she stood up with a happy face. She directly talked to Sun Rong who was the first in the team, and shook hands: "Classmate Sun Rong. I've really admired this name for a long time."</p>

    <p>Then out of politeness, she started to shake hands along Sun Rong. This move was very natural. It couldn't be said to be deliberate. But it felt like Su Xingyue was deliberately testing something.</p>

    <p>"Hello. Classmate Gu Shunzhi."</p>

    <p>"Hello. Classmate Chen Chao."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>These short words directly penetrated the hearts of Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>This voice was so sweet... it made Chen Chao and Guo Hao blush instantly.</p>

    <p>Such a loud voice.</p>

    <p>Are they the kind of people who can listen to it without paying?</p>

    <p>This is a sugar-coated bullet that belongs exclusively to Su Xingyue. Su Xingyue is not only good-looking. She is definitely a god-given benefit to the majority of the voice control party.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong's voice is also very nice. Chen Chao and Guo Hao even thought Sun Rong had received voice actor training when they first started school.</p>

    <p>But when Su Xingyue came, Sun Rong was eventually outclassed.</p>

    <p>After all, they have listened to Sun Rong's voice for most of the semester. But Su Xingyue's sweetness is new. No one will refuse the wonderful experience brought by this new thing.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue sent sugar-coated bullets one by one while observing everyone's reaction.</p>

    <p>When her hand reached Wang Zhen's, she suddenly felt that Wang Zhen's expression seemed a little nervous.</p>

    <p>It was not the nervousness of shaking hands with her, but the nervousness of being stared at by some kind of danger. As if he was about to lose his life in the next moment. Big beads of sweat rolled down his cheeks.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue immediately smiled and said: "Classmate Wang Zhen, are you okay?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen didn't dare to look in Liu Qingyi's direction. He knew what he should do. So he didn't wait for Su Xingyue to shake hands. He just clenched his hand into a fist and touched Su Xingyue: "Prevent and control the epidemic. Everyone has a responsibility. Let's skip the handshake..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue felt frustrated for the first time. But she still tried her best to keep smiling.</p>

    <p>She suddenly discovered that the people at Number 60 High School seemed to be different from those she had met before. Except for Chen Chao and Guo Hao, whose reactions were expected and normal, everyone else who came into contact with her was so sparse. Not the usual look.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School has improved its ranking rapidly in the past six months, but it has not reached the level of Shengke, right?</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue originally thought that everyone in Number 60 High School looked like Chen Chao or Guo Hao. However, during the handshake, she found that these selected 60 elites all had a dull reaction.</p>

    <p>It seems like someone who is used to big scenes...</p>

    <p>Each one of them seemed to have saved the universe.</p>

    <p>However, as a student of Shengke, Su Xingyue still worked hard to maintain her self-cultivation. Even if she was exhausted, she still used her professional expression management to control her smile well.</p>

    <p>"Hello. Classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>The last one is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She noticed it from the moment Wang Ling entered the door.</p>

    <p>This is the first person from Number 60 High School to rise up the ranking list this time. And Wang Ling has also appeared in several major competitions before.</p>

    <p>Although he looks weak, his usual results are not particularly outstanding. But every time there is a competition for Wang Ling, it seems that Number 60 High School has won.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue was particularly concerned about this. She took the initiative to shake hands with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the invisible skin sensor on the palm is also running.</p>

    <p>This is the second black technology of Shengke. The skin-type gloves are like a thin film on the hands. No one will notice that Su Xingyue is wearing such a magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Skin gloves are used in combination with contact lenses. They can locate a person's state more accurately.</p>

    <p>She shook hands one by one before. This was the purpose.</p>

    <p>This group of elite students from Number 60 High School are all in the late Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Su Xingyue was a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>This is the only average strength of the elite.</p>

    <p>Their first-year students in Golden Core all started in the middle of Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Some can even break through to Nascent Soul in their senior year of high school.</p>

    <p>At this time, Su Xingyue felt slightly disappointed. However, to be cautious, she still conducted the test according to the plan she had made before.</p>

    <p>The moment she shook hands with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue suddenly felt that her palms were heating up rapidly!</p>

    <p>This, this, this... what's going on?</p>

    <p>The sudden scene surprised Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>After confirming that Wang Ling's level was only in the mid-term of Foundation Building, she quickly let go of her hand.</p>

    <p>At this moment, everyone's focus has also shifted. Even Chen Chao and Guo Hao have woken up from Su Xingyue's gentle land.</p>

    <p>Because they found that Su Xingyue's eyes were actually smoking...</p>

    <p>Contact lenses and gloves broke at the same time!</p>

    <p>This is a situation Su Xingyue had never thought of.</p>

    <p>But Su Xingyue deserves to be Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>As one of Shengke's trump cards, even in this situation, she still moved forward and retreats freely and remained calm.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I need to go to the bathroom." She almost ran away. She quickly went to the bathroom, took off her glasses and gloves, and put them into her storage bag.</p>

    <p>Because these two things are so easy to use. Su Xingyue uses them very frequently. In addition, she often travels abroad to compete. She has no time to maintain...</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the chain dropped at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she has already tested everyone at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>These sixty elites are still far behind compared to Shengke.</p>

    <p>This time they are going to the center of the earth for the competition. The Huaxiu delegation can bring an extra team of seven students. As the number one university, Shengke will definitely go.</p>

    <p>Then the remaining seven-member team will be selected from the top thirty universities in the country.</p>

    <p>That's right. Top 30!</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is currently ranked 37th in the country. Not even qualified to go there!</p>

    <p>It even stands to reason that Number 60 High School and Shengke are incompatible with each other.</p>

    <p>But she doesn't know why. This time, the name of Number 60 High School is included in the official recommendation list...</p>

    <p>So almost as soon as the game was over, Su Xingyue received an order to come to Number 60 High School for testing.</p>

    <p>And the person who ordered her to come here is none other than the current principal of Shengke. Dai Tianchun, known as Dai Crazy Devil...</p>
