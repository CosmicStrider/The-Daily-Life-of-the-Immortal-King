  <h1>Chapter 1784: A powerful dragon cannot suppress a local snake. So what if it suppresses it...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is obviously the person who was arranged here. Even if Wang Ling doesn't read the other person's mind, he will know that this person is here to deliberately cause trouble. The force he belongs to may be Tengu. It may also be other organizations.</p>

    <p>After all, Glio City is a foreign country. The internal structure of the city is very complex. The Tengu are just one of the forces. The rest include mercenaries, news organizations, local gangsters, and cultivation scientific research institutions stationed in Glio City all year round.</p>

    <p>These organizations usually do not deal with each other. But one thing they have in common is that they are all exclusive. They even do not hesitate to fabricate news and create lies to cover up some of the bad acts they have done.</p>

    <p>Take a small number of news organizations as an example. The fake news they broadcast is almost all filtered by the underworld. There is no sense of disobedience at all when paired with suona music. It feels like it will send people away just by looking at it.</p>

    <p>"Is this person deliberately looking for trouble?" At this time, Li Youyue asked, breaking the silence in the private room.</p>

    <p>"Obviously there is a problem. Now the Huaguo Shuilian Group under Boss Sun has a cooperative relationship with the Office of Strategic Deception. It is already attracting attention. In addition, it has acquired many hotel chains in Glio City. Such behavior may be of interests to some people here who have been touched." Guo Hao analyzed calmly: "In the future, there will definitely be many people who come to make trouble."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue: "I heard that many people in Glio City are very xenophobic, especially against Asians. Even the old lady walking along the road may suddenly encounter one or two losers and kick her down with flying legs."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Fang Xing sighed helplessly: "This is the chain of discrimination in the world. And this chain of discrimination will always exist. It is difficult to change in a short time. The only way is to strengthen oneself. And get stronger and stronger. So strong that one day they follow their heart."</p>

    <p>"Follow your heart?"</p>

    <p>"It means cowardly."</p>

    <p>"So it is..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened to the debate among several people in the private room. At the same time, he also noticed that the man outside was driven away by the hotel manager in a kind and forceful manner. He finally left the restaurant cursing.</p>

    <p>The people were gone. But the noise still had an impact on the surrounding customers. Facing the mess in front of him, the hotel manager couldn't help but sigh. He shook his head and ordered people to clean up the mess. It was very helpless.</p>

    <p>"I wonder if the man just now has any secret filming equipment." At this time, Li Youyue suddenly said: "Nowadays, there are many evil people who complain first. If the man just filmed something, he would then add it to the malicious editing and publish it on the Internet. I'm afraid it will have a serious impact on Boss Sun."</p>

    <p>"This is too cheap..." Chen Chao was surprised.</p>

    <p>"But you can't help it that some people do believe in it. Whether it's at home or abroad, people only believe in what they believe in. When rumors start, the truth is not so important to some people, they just want to vent their anger at that moment of pleasure. They just want to get off on the wrong foot, and when they've said what they want to say, they don't care what the truth is."</p>

    <p>"Do you want me to take care of it?" Fang Xing looked into Wang Ling's eyes and said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly shook his head.</p>

    <p>He has already sent a text message to Wang Ming. Check the coordinates of that person. Make sure nothing weird has been secretly photographed.</p>

    <p>And with Wang Ming's personality, while hacking into the other party's device, he will also publish some strange things saved in the other party's device... and forward them to the Internet for public display. It will be a social death.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao took a bite of the vegetable, and it was like chewing wax in his mouth. Sure enough, after being stirred up, he didn't even like eating anymore. He couldn't help but complain: "People like this don't know what to do with their lives..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>It was eight o'clock that night. That was when Sun Rong had just arrived in Glio City.</p>

    <p>On the way to the hotel Sun Rong saw the news on the local news station.</p>

    <p>The news claimed that when leaving the hotel, a man named Meili failed to pay attention to the traffic information because he was cursing and was directly hit by a truck...</p>

    <p>Thomas fell into a sewer under maintenance right in front of him in a full rotation position. Finally, he fell into a deep septic tank. Due to the acceleration of gravity, he sank too deep. Finally, after a few flops, he suffocated. And died.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Uncle Lin. Is this Meili the one who came to our hotel to cause trouble before..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin glanced at the portraits on the screen and frowned: "It's broken. It seems to be true."</p>

    <p>"Why do you say it's broken?"Sun Rong was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Miss, I don't know. The power in Glio City is complicated. We just took over the hotel and this guy came to cause trouble. It was obviously arranged by a small group of power organizations behind the scenes."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said: "Although this man did not die directly in our hotel, and judging from the surveillance footage, it was a 100% accident. However, the forces behind it must have believed that this man was causing trouble, so we Secretly sent someone to kill him."</p>

    <p>"This works too..." Sun Rong was shocked. She didn't expect that she had just arrived in Glio City and would be involved in such a thing.</p>

    <p>She just wanted to come here to take everyone to have fun, travel, and help Wang Ling use the world's snack coupons... She didn't expect that as soon as she landed, she would be directly involved in a power dispute.</p>

    <p>"Miss, I'm afraid the road ahead is not going to be easy. The hotel has just been acquired. We must be extremely careful next time."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin worriedly said: "These people may retaliate against us or the people around us at any time. Miss has her own master. Regarding safety issues, I can relax a little. But Miss, those of your classmates..."</p>

    <p>"Youyue is staying with me these two days, itâ€™s no problem. I can protect her." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"But what about Guo Hao..."</p>

    <p>"He has many uncles. Maybe there are uncles of his in those powerful organizations..."</p>

    <p>"Fang Xing?"</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin should know, right? He is actually Immortal She Pi's son. There must be no problem in protecting himself."</p>

    <p>"What about Chen Chao?"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong heard this and fell silent.</p>

    <p>Because she couldn't speak openly about Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Although she could vaguely feel that Meili's death might have something to do with Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Look, miss, there are always things we can't take care of." Butler Lin frowned: "What I'm most worried about is Mr. Wang Ling and Mr. Muyu. Look at them. They all look so weak. Something might happen at any time!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, only these two are the most dangerous.</p>

    <p>One is a little dragon man formed by combining the excellent genes of the dragon clan. The other is an immortal king whose strength has no upper limit...</p>

    <p>Then here comes the problem.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong herself knows it too. A strong dragon cannot overwhelm a local snake.</p>

    <p>But there are two people there.</p>

    <p>She was actually quite curious. Even if she was suppressed, what could these people do to them...</p>
