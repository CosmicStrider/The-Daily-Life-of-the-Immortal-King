  <h1>Chapter 1841 Be cautious. It's always right.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at the ivory-colored three-person long bicycle in front of them, Wang Ling and Sun Rong fell into deep thought at the same time.</p>

    <p>It is really hard for Wang Ling's to imagine what it would be like to ride this bike on the street... Wouldn't they really be regarded as lunatics!</p>

    <p>And if he was caught between two girls, how would passers-by look at him? He is obviously not Neptune. Will he be regarded as Neptune...</p>

    <p>What if he is photographed by some nefarious person and posted on the Internet? He will die instantly?</p>

    <p>After all, some current news media can directly publish news about heavyweight academicians in reports without verification. It is really a very low-level behavior! It has seriously reduced the credibility of domestic media!</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that after it is posted, it is discovered that there was an error in the report. Immediately deleted the post and pretended that nothing happened. Don't even apologize. It was so shameless!</p>

    <p>A great man once said that the current journalism world needs to learn more. After all, it is too young. It also needs to improve its knowledge level. Otherwise, there will be deviations in future reports. You must be responsible! Don't think about it all day long.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this instruction is absolutely correct.</p>

    <p>So, it's always right to be cautious.</p>

    <p>"Don't look at this bicycle as ordinary. It's actually very flexible. I nicknamed it Little White Dragon." You Yueqing smiled and said: "Of course. I know you may not be used to it, so I gave it in advance. You have your helmets ready."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she took out the motorcycle helmet in an unusually "considerate" manner. You Yueqing knew Wang Ling's socially anxious personality very well. If Wang Ling was allowed to ride the motorcycle around in broad daylight, he would definitely not be used to it.</p>

    <p>So as long as you have a suitable covering, a motorcycle helmet is a good choice. It can also ensure safety while riding.</p>

    <p>After all, when the bicycles in the world of cultivation actually work, how fast they ride depends entirely on the level of the rider. You Yueqing was actually measuring the strength of them.</p>

    <p>They are all the pinnacles of the late Foundation Building period. The three of them riding together can make Xiao Bailong's driving speed directly exceed 600 kilometers an hour.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong both sweated.</p>

    <p>Of course they also know the hidden rule of riding a bicycle based on their realm... So if Wang Ling is allowed to ride a bicycle, even Sun Rong can hardly imagine what kind of experience it will be like. Going beyond the speed of light is just a basic operation. How many times the speed of light can be is the question.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took the motorcycle helmet. He couldn't help sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>We haven't seen each other for many years. You Yueqing's brain circuit is still as novel as ever. Fortunately, she is covered by a motorcycle helmet. Wang Ling feels at least not so ashamed.</p>

    <p>Before getting on, Wang Ling shook his finger and used the lowest intensity enlightenment technique on the little white dragon to prevent it from directly disintegrating while the little white dragon was traveling at high speed.</p>

    <p>Then he put on his helmet and headed straight for the front of the bicycle. Just in case, You Yueqing planned to take the driving right of the bicycle into her own hands.</p>

    <p>However, this action was directly seen by You Yueqing. She immediately intercepted it and said, "Wait a minute Wang Ling! Do you know the way? Otherwise, I'll do it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Of course he knew the way. If You Yueqing hadn't insisted on following, he might have found a remote corner and teleported directly with Sun Rong according to the coordinates.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling being asked by You Yueqing and in a dilemma. Sun Rong immediately stood up to smooth things over: "How about I do it. I've been to that place before. I know the way."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure?" You Yueqing confirmed again.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I'm sitting at the front." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then Wang Ling is sitting in second place. I'm sitting at the end."</p>

    <p>The calm discussion is over.</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was about to sit at the front, she suddenly realized a very serious problem!</p>

    <p>That's when Sun Rong suddenly realized that this seemed to be plotted by You Yueqing...</p>

    <p>First of all, Wang Ling, who is sitting in the second seat, is definitely not holding her waist... Then You Yueqing, who was sitting in the third seat! She'll probably hug Wang Ling's waist! And then she'd call him "giegie<sup>1</sup>" in an extremely intimate manner...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("哥哥" meaning "older brother")</dfn>

    <p>That strong sense of imagery occupied Sun Rong's mind almost instantly...</p>

    <p>It turns out that Daoist You is waiting for me here!</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>You Yueqing must not be allowed to succeed.</p>

    <p>So before getting on, Sun Rong changed her mind again: "Director You, there is a section of the road that I don't remember very clearly. Why don't you sit in the second seat? It's convenient for you to give me directions..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. No problem."</p>

    <p>To Sun Rong's surprise, You Yueqing agreed happily. There was no trace of regret on her face.</p>

    <p>At that moment Sun Rong's heart was touched.</p>

    <p>She felt that maybe she was just thinking too much. She shouldn't be so petty...</p>

    <p>But sometimes she still feels that she should be more cautious as a person. This is always right.</p>

    <p>Just like that, a Taoist priest and two high school students from the "Foundation Building Period" of a cultivation college officially rode the little white dragon and embarked on the road to find the video blogger named Li Xuan.</p>

    <p>After getting on the road, Wang Ling could feel the strong sense of shame through the motorcycle helmet. The eyes of the people around him seemed to fall on him through the motorcycle helmet. Wang Ling's forehead is covered with sweat.</p>

    <p>He had no choice but to pedal hard to complete his mission. After many twists and turns, he finally arrived at the address previously registered in the Taoist temple at almost 7:30 pm.</p>

    <p>It was an apartment. The three of them came downstairs. The apartment manager immediately opened the door. His eyes were very alert: "Who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>"We are looking for a resident named Li Xuan. Can you let us in?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"You're not from this apartment, are you? I haven't seen you. Unless she comes down to pick you up, I can't let you in." The apartment manager said strictly, "And lately there are some criminals who like to disguise themselves as the poor student body to sneak into the apartment to steal... Of course, I'm not doubting you, it's just that there's been a lot of panic lately, and it's our job."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>At this time, the apartment manager said again: "By the way, if you can find the landlord of this apartment, and if the landlord allows it, I can let you in. I am just a part-time worker. I really can't bear the responsibility if something happens."</p>

    <p>"The landlord? Are all the apartments tenants?" You Yueqing asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes." The apartment manager nodded: "This is a group apartment for white-collar workers. It is specially rented to migrant workers. There is only one landlord. He owns this building."</p>

    <p>"That's easy to handle." Sun Rong heard this and instantly became happy.</p>

    <p>When she took out her phone, Wang Ling already knew what Sun Rong wanted to do.</p>

    <p>They just heard Sun Rong make a phone call to Mr. Boss Sun. She said: "Yes. Grandpa! Have you heard of an apartment called Conch Apartment? It's on Beihai Road. Yes. I like this building. Okay. Grandpa, can you put it down? It can be done in ten minutes, right? Uh-huh... ok. I'm waiting for news from grandpa!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, You Yueqing and the apartment manager were dumbfounded at the same time.</p>

    <p>From their perspective, it seems that what Sun Rong just bought was not an apartment, but a walnut...</p>
