  <h1>Chapter 2116 How tacit understanding is there between Wang Ling and Sun Rong?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong was pushed away by the heavy-armored monk who came to deliver the message. She felt unhappy in her heart, but she still held it back.</p>

    <p>They are all guards. How can this seem like a sense of superiority?</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong is also extremely cautious about the next task, because she knows very well that as the opening plot of the early game, judging from her character setting, it is definitely more beneficial to the future process to hide her gender.</p>

    <p>And once she is exposed, it means that her identity is exposed. The ancient world of cultivation has always advocated the misunderstanding and bad habits of male superiority and female inferiority. In this drama full of male chauvinism, her identity will be exposed. If you poke it, it will make it even harder to mix.</p>

    <p>Especially in a remote place like Fuyun Town, a cold place that is not very prosperous, this kind of discrimination becomes more and more serious.</p>

    <p>She saw the joking smile under the heavy-armored monk's helmet. She felt less like a guard and more like a prisoner.</p>

    <p>In his spare time, Sun Rong actually likes to play games. Not for anything else, but to have a better relationship with Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>These are the two buddies that Wang Ling has the best relationship with at Number 60 High School. So Sun Rong feels that the investment in interpersonal relationships in Chen Chao and Guo Hao is very worthwhile!</p>

    <p>Therefore, no matter what games they play, Sun Rong can always find a topic to keep up with. Nowadays, she has played a lot of online games, stand-alone games, mobile games... with Guo Hao and Chen Chao. Now. You are all familiar with all major categories of games. Master them proficiently.</p>

    <p>So in last year's corporate financial report of Huaguo Shuilian Group, everyone was surprised to find that as a well-known pharmaceutical research and development group in the cultivation world, Huaguo Shuilian Group has also begun to make plans in entertainment.</p>

    <p>It has invested in many excellent studios. It has even unilaterally conducted special project evaluations and angel round capital injections for high-end game producers to assist in development.</p>

    <p>The proposer is Sun Rong. The person who finally approved it was Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>This is not because Sun Yiyuan dotes on Sun Rong. It's because he thinks Sun Rong's proposal makes sense.</p>

    <p>As for the proposal... I understand everything. The reason must be very high-level. Otherwise, how can I convince other shareholders?</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong directly wrote a paper {On the Impact of Expanding the Development of the Game Industry on the Future Strategic Layout of the Cultivation World}.</p>

    <p>The total number of words in the paper is between 50,000 and 60,000. It lists the current status of the game industry, its future development, and in-depth analysis of its strategic significance from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>In the report, Sun Rong emphasized the strategic significance. That is, once a holographic game is developed in the game industry and can be connected to the nerves of human monks, it may directly solve the problem of peacetime problems. Next. The monks' actual combat and close combat training issues. The entire strategic sandbox simulation can even be completed directly in the game.</p>

    <p>In this way, the drill problems of the monks in peacetime will be greatly improved. And as long as the information security is in place, in the holographic game cabin, some modern combat deployments can be directly simulated physically in this way.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the concept of this paper is a fantasy. It is even a bit funny in the eyes of many experts...</p>

    <p>But the bosses won't care, because what they want is a concept, and it's best if it's controversial. It can also make most people understand the concept but not understand it.</p>

    <p>The holographic game cabin is essentially similar to the concept of the Metaverse. No one knows whether it is possible. But now {Itinerant Immortal Ring} is out. This proves that it is really possible...</p>

    <p>Sometimes technology advances, often just overnight.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Let's get back to the subject. On the way to see the prison boss. Sun Rong was not noticeable either.</p>

    <p>She knew she couldn't just let it go. She had to find some way to disrupt the current rhythm of the game or at least ensure that she had a trump card.</p>

    <p>But she is an ancient heavy-armored monk. She only has special bonuses when holding heavy weapons! Otherwise, she is just a human shield with thicker initial HP and slightly higher defense...</p>

    <p>Wrong...</p>

    <p>Who said that heavily armored monks must wear heavy weapons?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong checked his [Inventory]: Ancient Silver Scale Armor (white), Ancient Silver Scale Helmet (white), Ancient Silver Scale Spear (white).</p>

    <p>These three items are all blank equipment, and they bring a high load to her. The helmet and armor are okay. The load of this spear is 150 points! Wearing it on her body seriously affects her speed!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong still wants a lighter weapon.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the game itself has no restrictions on the choice of weapons across professions. It just loses the bonuses that come with the profession.</p>

    <p>Who says mages can't wear heavy armor?</p>

    <p>Who said that an immortal sword must have a gourd on the waist? A barefooted old man who smells of alcohol and smells bad?</p>

    <p>So the next second, Sun Rong's idea became very clear. She decided to practice swordsmanship on her own.</p>

    <p>Although she currently does not have any in-game channels for acquiring sword skills, she knows about the channels outside the game! The developer of this game is Bai Qiao. Although she does not understand games, she understands Bai Qiao!</p>

    <p>This is the sheath spirit in Wang Ling's hand!</p>

    <p>And as an investor in the game, Sun Rong also has a very good relationship with Bai Qiao. I know that the spells, mental techniques, and skill settings in Sun Rong in {Itinerant Immortal's Magic Ring} all come from Heavenly Dao. Yes Adapted from existing stuff.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this. At this moment, Sun Rong made his own inference in his heart.</p>

    <p>Since the skills and mental skills are all designed based on Heavenly Dao, then the sword-related things... could they also be related to the Sword King Realm?</p>

    <p>Although sword spirits are all born from chaos, swordsmanship still comes from the root system of Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>While walking, Sun Rong, like Wang Ling, began to repeat what Wang Ling did in prison - trying to recite the swordsmanship formulas he knew silently!</p>

    <p>However, her knowledge is very limited. She definitely doesn't know as much as Wang Ling. But after all, Sun Rong has the passive ability of "integration of man and sword" with Aohai. maintains it in real life In the state of "human and sword unity", Aohai's learning is also of great benefit to herself.</p>

    <p>Aohai now has nine cores in his body. His strength is extraordinary. He is already superior to most sword spirits in the Sword King Realm. His knowledge is extensive. He can be compared with extraordinary sword spirits.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sun Rong knows hundreds of millions more sword techniques than regular cultivators.</p>

    <p>What surprised Sun Rong was that when she silently recited the third item, the relevant display about the skill appeared in the skill column.</p>

    <p>"Skill name: [Sword Coming Skill]."</p>

    <p>"Level: God level."</p>

    <p>"Explanation: The damage caused to you by all sword attacks will be reduced by 75%. You can obtain the skill of extracting any sword spirit and use it for your own use. When you are attacked by a sword weapon, the passive layer of this skill will be +1. Every point of passive layer gained will be regarded as gaining a point of agility attribute. At the same time, your passive layer will also determine the number of spiritual swords you can control at the same time..."</p>
