  <h1>Chapter 1450 Party A and Party B</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"My research and development has always been rapid. It only takes one week to have the experimental version of the magic weapon. Until then, please be patient, Ms. Jiugong."</p>

    <p>At this time, Shou Chong stood up and said with a smile: "I already have a general design idea. So Miss Jiugong, I will leave first."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master Shou Chong. I look forward to your research and development results." Jiugong nodded. She tried her best to smile. But it was a pity. The expression on her face was still stiff.</p>

    <p>"Easy to say." Shou Chong smiled.</p>

    <p>"Later, I will arrange for someone to go to Master Shou Chong's research institute to sign a contract. Five billion R&amp;D expenses will be paid immediately."</p>

    <p>"Miss, you are so happy." Shou Chong bowed.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly excused himself.</p>

    <p>Five billion R&amp;D expenses. This is something Shou Chong never dreamed of.</p>

    <p>After all, it is the Jiugong family. It is different to be generous. Compared with self-employed people like Fan Xing, the abundant supply of funds makes Shou Chong very satisfied.</p>

    <p>With such huge research and development costs, he is one step closer to his "big plan."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong's big plan originated from an extraterrestrial meteorite wrapped in black light. This meteorite is still sealed in his research institute. Although it is only 0.5g in size, it contains huge energy.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this small meteorite has an amazing amount of radiation. It also has the magical power to decompose spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>If you can make good use of it.</p>

    <p>Maybe this little black meteorite can provide wireless energy.</p>

    <p>Just like the legendary "artificial sun."</p>

    <p>And this is Shou Chong's "Infinite Energy Plan."</p>

    <p>He gave this black meteorite, which was only the size of a grain of sand, a nice name. It was called: Eternity.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family spent 5 billion to develop a magic weapon to find the dead fish-eyed boy. In fact, Shou Chong thinks that developing such a magic weapon would only cost tens of millions...</p>

    <p>As for the remaining funds, he can invest them all in his big plan.</p>

    <p>Between Party A and Party B, Party B seems to be a vulnerable group. But in fact, as long as they are good at calculation, they will not suffer too much.</p>

    <p>Especially scientific research expenses like this.</p>

    <p>The exact amount of investment is up to Shou Chong himself.</p>

    <p>Even if it is finally evaluated, there won't be any problems.</p>

    <p>After all. Knowledge is priceless.</p>

    <p>However. Regarding his "Infinite Energy Plan", Shou Chong estimates that his research funding will be at least around 20 billion before it can be documented.</p>

    <p>Although he received R&amp;D funding of 5 billion from the Jiugong family, in fact it was far from enough.</p>

    <p>So. About that night.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong went to another person's home.</p>

    <p>That is the villa of the Sun Rong family...</p>

    <p>"Hello. I have heard about Master Shou Chong for a long time." As soon as they met, the girl took the initiative to step forward and shake hands with Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>This surprised Shou Chong. He deliberately made himself look sloppy. On the way, many passers-by pinched their noses and rolled their eyes when they saw him.</p>

    <p>When he first arrived at Jiugong's house, Shou Chong could clearly feel that Jiugong Liangzi was trying his best to endure it.</p>

    <p>At that time, he secretly admired the cultivation of the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family. Unexpectedly, Sun Rong's generous and warm handshake gave Shou Chong a completely new impact.</p>

    <p>It is said that this young lady from the Huaguo Shuilian Group is generous and decent. It is indeed true...</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun Rong, wait a moment."</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Rong being so enthusiastic, Shou Chong naturally couldn't be rude. He took out the spray and sprayed his hands. He cleaned them briefly. Then he held them back and said, "I hope Miss Sun won't be offended. I just came from Coming out of the lab, it's a little messy..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I understand."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled and nodded: "Master, please sit down."</p>

    <p>Then she snapped her fingers.</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu, who had been waiting behind for a long time, brought prepared tea and cakes.</p>

    <p>In fact, this meeting with Sun Rong was an impromptu decision by Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>After leaving Jiugong's house, he actually had several investors he wanted to meet. These investors were all very interested in his novel magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Although RMB 20 billion in research funding is an astronomical amount, it can only be collected if we find a few more Party A dads.</p>

    <p>However, what Shou Chong didn't expect was that as soon as he came out of Shou Chong's house, Ms. Sun from the Huaguo Shuilian Group actually contacted him...</p>

    <p>This is a big fish!</p>

    <p>One person can be responsible for hundreds or even thousands of investors.</p>

    <p>For such a capable customer, for the sake of his own research funding, Shou Chong would certainly not miss it just like this.</p>

    <p>"I'm not a person who likes to beat around the bush. I came here today to ask Master Shou Chong. I want to ask, classmate Jiugong, what kind of magic weapon I want you to invent." Sun Rong was wearing a blue gauze dress. One hand is holding the tray. The other hand is holding the black tea cup. The waist is straight, showing the figure and demeanor of a young lady.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was silent. He smiled bitterly: "This matter involves customer confidentiality..."</p>

    <p>"I guess I haven't signed the relevant contract yet. Since I haven't signed it, then the contract is just a piece of waste paper. It's not a leak of secrets." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>"But even so, I can't say..." Shou Chong frowned, but decided to remain silent.</p>

    <p>Although his purpose is to raise funds, he still has professional ethics.</p>

    <p>"Even if Master doesn't say it, I still know."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong looked at Shou Chong and said, "Did Ms. Jiugong Liangzi commission the master to create a magic weapon that can find boys with dead fish eyes?"</p>

    <p>These words instantly made Shou Chong's pupils tremble.</p>

    <p>"This..." Shou Chong opened his eyes wide with disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>He didn't know where Miss Sun in front of him got the news.</p>

    <p>I was even more amazed at the girl's ability to control information.</p>

    <p>Of course. Such intelligence control capabilities cannot be achieved without alerting the family's power. Sun Rong alone is of course impossible.</p>

    <p>Jiugong is a dangerous person.</p>

    <p>So after Jiugong Liangzi left school, Sun Rong immediately contacted Lord Diulei and asked him to activate the Office of Strategic Deception's intelligence network and monitor all Jiugong Liangzi's actions.</p>

    <p>During this period, what Jiugong Liangzi said, what he did, and who he met... In fact, everything is within the control of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In fact, there is already an undercover agent arranged by the Office of Strategic Deception in the Jiugong family's villa.</p>

    <p>"It seems that what I said is completely correct."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled indifferently: ''I actually understand if the Master refuses to talk about it. However, this intelligence leak has nothing to do with Master. And the purpose of me coming to find Master this time is also very simple, that is, I hope that Master can develop a magic weapon that interferes with the opponent's magic treasure."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun means..."</p>

    <p>"What it means is that if Jiugong wants you to develop a magic weapon, just go in the opposite direction and develop a restraint magic weapon." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Reverse research and development... It's difficult. And the research and development costs are not cheap..."</p>

    <p>"Didn't she quote you five billion?" At this time, Sun Rong raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Could it be that Miss Sun can also pay such a price?" Shou Chong was curious.</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>The girl put her black tea cup back on the coffee table. She just smiled and said, "I'll pay three times."</p>

    <p>"What did Miss Sun say..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong couldn't believe his ears: "Three times?"</p>

    <p>"Now, I am also trying to learn to keep a low profile. But sometimes I have to take action."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Sun Rong smiled calmly: "Jiugong wants to play. Then I'll play with her."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>Now, he completely understood. This is basically a war between women!</p>

    <p>Women are so scary...</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he hasn't married a wife yet.</p>

    <p>From this point of view, for the rest of his life, he will still be like Gong Xuan, who was not willing to break out at his birthday party. He will live well with the ten-finger girl...</p>
