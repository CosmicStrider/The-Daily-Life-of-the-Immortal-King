  <h1>Chapter 1693 Old Avengers formed by victims</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chaos, darkness, and the fear of drowning...</p>

    <p>This pain is a lingering effect on all those who have fought Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just one second before being killed by Wang Ling, Master Wu Xin used his last strength to separate his brain waves and became a floating thing in the universe.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to quietly possess the minds of the members of the Office of Strategic Deception and wait patiently for a counterattack. The result was the moment he separated.</p>

    <p>This free brain wave was captured by an inexplicable force. It was like being wrapped in a sky net, wrapping it up airtight.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..." Wu Xin found it hard to believe that he would be caught.</p>

    <p>"We are just like you. We are avengers waiting for the opportunity." The voice laughed. It sounded directly from the depths of his mind. However, he was too weak at the moment and could not completely discard this voice.</p>

    <p>"The most urgent task right now is to restore your mind."</p>

    <p>The voice continued: "But your body is no longer there..."</p>

    <p>"Do you have any ideas?" Wu Xin asked.</p>

    <p>Intuitively speaking, he can actually judge that the person who captured him is definitely not from the same school as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And somehow he had a strong intuition.</p>

    <p>I feel that the person I am talking to has also been "persecuted" by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is a communication activity between victim and victim. Although they do not know each other well, they have a wonderful telepathic communication induction.</p>

    <p>"It's not difficult to solve the physical problem. I have time cells that can allow you to use the power of time memory to change back to your original appearance after the recovery of your mental brain." At this time, another voice came from his mind.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Wu Xin was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Both of us are victims. All you need to know is that we will help you."</p>

    <p>"But God's brain is broken. What I retain here is just a section of isolated brain waves. It's not easy to restore it."</p>

    <p>"It's actually not that difficult. You just need to find the right match."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen said: "And this matching is actually on the earth... if you are possessed by a person now, how long can it last?"</p>

    <p>"No more than half an hour at most."</p>

    <p>"That's enough."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe nodded and said in harmony with Fenmu Shen: "Next, we will help you transfer this memory to a person quietly."</p>

    <p>"who?"</p>

    <p>"This is a citizen of your city. He is also a wealthy businessman in the core area. His name is... Jia Bugui."</p>

    <p>"Jia Bugui?" Wu seemed to have some impression of this person.</p>

    <p>But he couldn't figure out why him.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you don't know yet. Your world has long been invaded by people using brain waves."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe laughed: "This person's name is Wang Ming. He is also one of the opponents we will face in the future..."</p>

    <p>"So what's the current plan?"</p>

    <p>"This person is a perfect match for you, so you just need to cooperate with us to complete this plan of swapping a cat for a prince unnoticed, so that your brainwaves can quietly enter his body, and then, take over his body."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe said: "Of course. The conditions for realizing all this are not without."</p>

    <p>"Then... let's talk about the conditions." Wu Xin knew that in his current situation, he actually had no choice.</p>

    <p>"Join us."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe and Fenmu Shen said in unison: "Our name is. Old Avengers..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Riding the space elevator on the way, Sun Rong connected the Sun family big family Sun Yiyuan's phone, words with a few points of urgency: "Grandpa, I would like to ask you ..."</p>

    <p>She originally didn't want to trouble Boss Sun, but now the situation is urgent. Wang Ling's birthday is coming soon, which makes her feel panicked. She doesn't know what to give to express her feelings.</p>

    <p>"You said you wanted to give a gift to your classmate Wang Ling. You don't know what to give, right?" This question also stumped Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>He knows Wang Ling's character. Being too outgoing and high-profile will definitely not work.</p>

    <p>"How about sending an aircraft carrier?" Sun Yiyuan thought for a moment and said seriously.</p>

    <p>"Aircraft carrier..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt like he was choked on his unspoken words: "Grandpa... Isn't this aircraft carrier too high-profile?"</p>

    <p>"Isn't this high-profile? Isn't it just a yacht... I didn't send a spaceship or anything like that..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is speechless.</p>

    <p>It seems that her grandfather has some misunderstandings about keeping a low profile.</p>

    <p>However, given that Mr. Sun's wealth can rival that of the country, an aircraft carrier is indeed like a yacht, and in just one of the harbors that cooperates with the Huaguo Shuilian Group, there are no less than sixty of them parked.</p>

    <p>"But grandpa, even if this is not high-profile to you, a gift that can be bought with money is not considered sincerity." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Sun Yiyuan nodded meaningfully: "Oh... yes. How about... a few earthy love words?"</p>

    <p>"Old... earthy love words?"Sun Rong looked confused.</p>

    <p>"For example, Rongrong. What is your favorite wine?" Sun Yiyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa. I'm still a student..."</p>

    <p>"I know. So, this is just an example." Sun Yiyuan said: "If these words are what you said to classmate Wang Ling, classmate Wang Ling must not know how to answer. Then when the time comes. You can confess your feelings by ear."</p>

    <p>"Then what should I say next?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"This question is very simple."</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed: "Of course I will be with you forever (wine)."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, the rest: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan: "Another example. You can tell your classmate Wang Ling that you are Linger. He is Dingdang."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Because the bell wants to jingle."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, the rest: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Oh, by the way. Regarding this earthy love story, I know another one. You can say, you are the immortal sword. He is the hero. Because the immortal sword is the hero."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, the rest: "?"</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong didn't understand much, she felt that something was wrong with Er Ha...</p>

    <p>After asking several times, I didn't get the answer I wanted. Sun Rong hung up the phone with some disappointment.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that she feels that if we continue talking, her mind will collapse even more.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi suggested: "Seriously Rong Rong, do you want to deliver yourself and surprise Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushed instantly: "Is this... is this really okay?"</p>

    <p>To be honest, she had this idea before. She just didn't know if it was feasible...</p>

    <p>"I think it's feasible."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi continued to make suggestions: "Look. Then you can find an excuse and say that classmate Wang Ling won the prize with crispy noodles. In addition to giving him a limited edition crispy noodles, he will also receive a beautifully packaged one. Big gift box. But you are hidden in the big gift box..."</p>
