  <h1>Chapter 2155 Hello. Boss Qin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>According to game terminology, Mr. Zanghu's behavior can be regarded as moving bricks. It's just that the method of moving bricks is much more advanced than ordinary players.</p>

    <p>In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, one of the most common tricks is to capture spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>Players with a guild have a high probability of receiving the task of capturing spiritual beasts during daily guild tasks. Some players will go to the market to buy ready-made ones directly with cash for the sake of convenience.</p>

    <p>As a result, a brick-moving industry chain was born.</p>

    <p>Catching spirit beasts is not without risk. Therefore, usually the price of the spirit beast in guild missions will be increased by 10% on the basis of the spirit beast itself.</p>

    <p>And Mr. Zanghu's refining of medicine seems even more advanced.</p>

    <p>His thinking is very clear.</p>

    <p>He first relies on selling at a discount to accumulate customers. When he makes money, it means that he can refine higher-level medicinal materials. When the time comes, the price will be raised. The other players who buy will not have any objections.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that there is no limit to blood replenishment. It is really quite tempting.</p>

    <p>It's much more cost-effective than buying it directly from the drug store.</p>

    <p>In addition, Mr. Zanghu's hunger marketing scheme directly caused long queues for his small medicine stalls in towns.</p>

    <p>The pharmacy next to it was open, but no one came to buy medicine. This made the NPC who is the owner of the pharmacy very depressed.</p>

    <p>In the end, the drugstore owner really couldn't hold on any longer.</p>

    <p>He saw that Mr. Zanghu's handicap was getting bigger and bigger. He couldn't help but applied to Mr. Zanghu and planned to rent out the shop.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the plan was successful, Mr. Zanghu couldn't help laughing. He is obviously a very reserved person. He will never laugh no matter how funny it is.</p>

    <p>For Mr. Zanghu, buying this store was not the key. It was that he fell in love with the ready-made medicinal herbs in this pharmacy.</p>

    <p>This means that Mr. Zanghu no longer has to hire a convoy to risk his life to collect spiritual plants in dangerous places in the jungle as before. This medicine shop has a mature supply chain. The system will refresh the medicinal materials every day. And he only needs to be responsible. Just refine and sell it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The sight returns to Itinerant Immortal, the most futuristic and technological mechanical city in the world.</p>

    <p>Shortly after the kidnapping incident ended, news came from Fuyun Town that the Xiongwu people fled in panic. As a member of the Four Elephants, Li Ziye, a player of the Immortal Sword, simply couldn't accept this result.</p>

    <p>Originally, being pressed to the ground and rubbed by Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi was already a blow. Unexpectedly, this double blow came so quickly...</p>

    <p>The Four Elephants suddenly went from the peak to being the object of criticism. This feeling of disparity is felt by every Sword Immortal player who joins the Four Elephants.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Li Ziye is in a very low mood. But what kind of organization is the Sixiangzhong? Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi know more or less.</p>

    <p>They took Ling Ziye to a high-end inn in a mechanical city. The price of staying here for one night was 1,000 taels of silver.</p>

    <p>Normal players would definitely be reluctant to part with it.</p>

    <p>But Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi have a lot of money. Even if they live alone, it won't be a big problem.</p>

    <p>When the innkeeper met Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi was of a low level. He felt that he was a newcomer and was easy to fool. He also asked the two fools to apply for a card. He said that as long as he recharged the full amount, he would be able to participate in cashback activities. The maximum cashback could be 300%. Also You just get back what you charge. And the boss promises that all the money in the card can be withdrawn at any time.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong became excited when he mentioned the lottery. He had never seen such a man come to his door and ask for a lottery by himself.</p>

    <p>I charged two million into it in one breath.</p>

    <p>As a result, now, Qin Zhong not only has six million taels of silver, but also becomes the owner of this inn...</p>

    <p>This made Ling Ziye completely unstoppable.</p>

    <p>He found that this man's luck was simply terrifying.</p>

    <p>I can seal the sword immortal myself. I won't talk about it if I can't seal it. Even a high-end inn like this can be won by lottery...</p>

    <p>He had never seen such an outrageous operation.</p>

    <p>A high-end inn located in Machinery City. You can buy it directly for 5 million.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong's wave of lottery bankrupted the entire inn, so he was forced to become the new owner here.</p>

    <p>"Boss Qin, this is your tea." The former female boss obediently picked up the tea and put it down one by one in front of Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi and Li Ziye. Then she turned her graceful posture and left respectfully.</p>

    <p>"Who are you two..." Li Ziye was shocked.</p>

    <p>He was extremely scared.</p>

    <p>Especially when facing Qin Zhong, a man whose fate is unknown, I feel a deep sense of fear.</p>

    <p>"You don't need to know who we are. But you'd better give yourself a chance." Qin Zhong took a sip of tea and said to Li Ziye.</p>

    <p>"Brothers... I'm stupid. I don't know if I can explain it more clearly..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi looked at each other. Then Xiang Yi took the initiative to speak: "You should know what kind of organization the Four Elephants are in reality."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know this."</p>

    <p>Li Ziye nodded and answered fluently: "This is the branch left by Immortal Fan Rui, who created the Wuji Sword Sect. It is said that it was founded by one of his disciples, Xie Jian Shen. It is a pity that this branch does not follow the right path. causing chaos everywhere."</p>

    <p>"Since you know so clearly, why do you still choose to join?" Xiang Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"This... is just a game... does it need to be so serious?" Li Ziye was stunned.</p>

    <p>"What else do you know about the Four Elephants?"</p>

    <p>"I also know that in the legend, the leader of the Four Elephants is Xiong Wu. Behind him are three people who stand side by side with Xiong Wu. Zhu Zhen, Xue Hu and Qing Jiao. These four people respectively master different swordsmanship and have superior strength. In real life He was once a Class A wanted criminal..."</p>

    <p>"It seems that you know the situation of the Four Elephants very well."</p>

    <p>At this time, Qin Zhong took a deep breath, looked at Li Ziye and said, "What if I tell you that the Four Symbols in the game now were founded by these four people?"</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, Li Ziye was dumbfounded on the spot: "No... it can't be right? How is this possible... doesn't all games have to be real-name?"</p>

    <p>"These days, naughty kids know how to use their grandparents' ID cards to log into the game and pretend to be adults."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi complained: "You should know the grandparents and grandmothers who are racing in Summoner's Rift these days. There may be a naughty kid standing behind them."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words left Li Ziye speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <p>If the Four Elephants in the game are really played by criminal gangs, then it would be much easier for them to obtain false identities than for normal people.</p>

    <p>"Then... what do the two brothers want me to do..." Li Ziye was stunned.</p>

    <p>I never thought that something so outrageous would happen to me.</p>

    <p>"It's simple. Just give yourself a chance."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong responded: "You are an old member of the Four Elephants. So it stands to reason that it shouldn't be difficult to introduce us to the Four Elephants, right?"</p>
