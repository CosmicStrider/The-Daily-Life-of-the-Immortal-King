  <h1>Chapter 1516 You will eventually live like Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The internal structure of Jiudaohe High School is more complicated than Sun Rong imagined.</p>

    <p>Looking at the Rainbow Seven Sons gang members who were continuously flowing towards the Wang Ling dormitory.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suddenly felt regretful that he had not investigated the matter earlier.</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a conspiracy.</p>

    <p>Jisaki can securely occupy the position of student council president.</p>

    <p>In addition to his own efforts and strength, his vice president codenamed Ma Jiao is the real role.</p>

    <p>This man-eating Ma Jiao. drew all the attention to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And the real purpose is probably aimed at her.</p>

    <p>Recalling the grudge between himself and Jisaki back then. Sun Rong couldn't help but let out a long sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>It seems...</p>

    <p>It's time to find a chance. Talk to Jisaki.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to find that Jisaki?" Wang Ming seemed to have expected Sun Rong to make this decision long ago.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoer, how do you know?" Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"I can't read minds."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and pointed to his brain: "I'm just using mental deduction."</p>

    <p>"After I input your temper, personality and various measurements."</p>

    <p>"Many lines of words suddenly appeared in my mind. Clearly list the decisions you might make. Then sort them according to probability."</p>

    <p>"And among these rankings. The first one is: go talk to Jisaki."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath: "I understand the truth. But... why do you need measurements data..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, the more data, the better. The more accurate, the better. Don't worry, Miss Rong. Your data is pretty good. It's just the right size."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed a grapefruit from the fruit plate at the dinner: "No... this one is a bit too big."</p>

    <p>He threw away the grapefruit. Then he grabbed another tangerine and said, "That's not right either. This one is too small."</p>

    <p>Finally, he grabbed a peach and said, "That's about it."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Realizing that he seemed a little rude in front of his younger siblings, Wang Ming quickly put down the fruit and coughed: "I'm just making an analogy. Don't mind Miss Rong... Actually, what I mean is that Miss Rong is very good. Big breasts are of no use." .Look at that Lord of Shadow Stream. What's the fate of him?"</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Sun Rong still felt something was wrong: "But in the Immortal King animation, she is very strong!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming spread his hands and said: "That is the animation of the daily life of the Immortal King. What does it have to do with the daily life of the Immortal King?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"No work is perfect. There are always regrets. Just make more progress next time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled bitterly and said: "That's too far off topic... By the way, that Jisaki. What are you going to do? Do you want my help?"</p>

    <p>"No need, Brother Xiaoer. I can handle it myself. I'm still worried now. Classmate Wang Ling..." Sun Rong's brows frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>She released Aohai's sword energy. Like a radar, she captured the students who were rushing towards Wang Ling after the orientation party.</p>

    <p>Because of Ma Jiao's words.</p>

    <p>Now the gang students of the Rainbow Seven Gang have sent beautiful representatives to recruit Wang Ling into the gang.</p>

    <p>The girl is not worried that Wang Ling will fall into the trap.</p>

    <p>She just felt a little uncomfortable in her heart.</p>

    <p>She held her forehead.</p>

    <p>Suddenly she felt like she was a little hopeless.</p>

    <p>Obviously, classmate Wang Ling has not responded to her at all.</p>

    <p>Everything is just her one-sided unrequited love... The result is that under such circumstances, she would actually be jealous over such a thing!</p>

    <p>Sometimes. Sun Rong finds that she is quite selfish.</p>

    <p>But regarding emotional matters, she felt there was nothing wrong with being selfish.</p>

    <p>Because this is a one-way street.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, sister. Leave it to me." Wang Ming curled his lips.</p>

    <p>Because he knew Sun Rong very well, the accuracy of the mental deduction technique was actually very high. Literature major</p>

    <p>He could almost immediately figure out what Sun Rong was thinking about now.</p>

    <p>"Second brother, it's better to call me Rongrong..."</p>

    <p>"Okay, sister-in-law."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong's face was hot. She had given up resistance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming crossed his arms and looked at Sun Rong with a smile: "Actually, what I call younger brother and sister makes sense."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Have you noticed, sister-in-law? You are gradually living like Wang Ling now."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words initially made Sun Rong somewhat unresponsive.</p>

    <p>But soon. She understood instantly...</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl couldn't hold back her laughter.</p>

    <p>Some people will eventually live like the person they hate the most.</p>

    <p>And some people, just like her...</p>

    <p>If you really live like the person you like, it seems to be good!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the dormitory, the students of Jiudaohe High School faced the menacing attack from outside. Wang Ling counted with his fingers. He soon knew what happened.</p>

    <p>The school systems are different. As a foreign school, Jiudaohe's internal environment is even more complicated.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Although competition is indeed a good thing.</p>

    <p>However, under such a clique-based system, the comparison mentality among students has intensified.</p>

    <p>This back and forth has become the source of school violence.</p>

    <p>And now the main reason why this group of people believe deeply in "Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>It's still the "National Ranking of College Students."</p>

    <p>In other countries Wang Ling doesn't know.</p>

    <p>But on Sun Island, high school students seem to particularly believe in this stuff.</p>

    <p>This is a comprehensive strength guide. It is somewhat similar to the sword ranking list in the Sword King Realm. It will convert each student's data into a comprehensive value, and finally present it on the ranking list.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao tampered with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had already started the operation on his way back to rescue Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The data of Wang Ling has been corrected.</p>

    <p>The data of Wang Ling has returned to the normal ranking. But in fact, the ranking is still very high...</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling did represent Number 60 High School in many important competitions before. And the key is that by coincidence, Number 60 High School got excellent rankings.</p>

    <p>This directly caused Wang Ling's "lucky value" to significantly increase its overall performance, which resulted in a large wave of data.</p>

    <p>The situation is more difficult than Wang Ming imagined.</p>

    <p>But this does not trouble Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He knew that keeping a low profile had always been his brother's rule.</p>

    <p>So in this case...</p>

    <p>The best way Wang Ming came up with was to use the strategy to his advantage.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>The Chinese culture is extensive and profound. He actually doesn't understand these students from Sun Island. For example, Ma Jiao and Jisaki, do they know what Houlang means?</p>

    <p>He just moved his eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately transmitted the terminal data through his brain waves, instantly hacking into the entire ranking list.</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>Sun Island National College Student Ranking. There are hundreds of thousands of high school students on the list. All IDs have been modified by Wang Ming to Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>And. When everyone opens the list.</p>

    <p>It will also force a pop-up window to pop up, playing a video of a speech by a middle-aged man with a magnetic voice...</p>
