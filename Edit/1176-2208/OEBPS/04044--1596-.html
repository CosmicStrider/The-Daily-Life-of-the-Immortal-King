  <h1>Chapter 1596 Ancestral Skills</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's move of "no birth, no form. All things are annihilated" catalyzes the annihilation sphere, which is extremely destructive. Although it looks like a huge bubble from a distance, the devastation is self-evident.</p>

    <p>After all, there are not many spells in this world that can burn off the hair of their brothers and sisters.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Fenmu Shen showed no mercy at all. This proves the importance of this Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling didn't know what it was. At first, he just thought that the golden light emitted by the Golden Lotus could offset the sight of his King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>This aroused Wang Ling's full curiosity. So he made up his mind to get the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fenmu Shen actually didn't know what this Golden Lotus was. He just felt that the brother and sister in front of him were trying their best to grab it... Naturally, he couldn't let Wang Ling and Wang Nuan succeed easily.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Being was wrapped in the Corpse Map. Looking at the battle in front of him, Zhang Zhui and the other eternal warriors were speechless.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I was frightened by the majestic, world-destroying battle in front of me.</p>

    <p>Of course, no one expected that in this cosmic-level battle, the focus of the conflict between the two sides would be over a three-petal Golden Lotus whose origin no one knew...</p>

    <p>Anyway, that's the core focus.</p>

    <p>--No one wants to let the other party succeed!</p>

    <p>When Ah Nuan girl used the ancestral skills of the Old Wang family and slapped Fenmu Shen's "Orb of Annihilation", a huge silent explosion occurred in the supreme world in just a moment.</p>

    <p>The scorching temperature and strong psychic energy fluctuations were rolled up along with the explosion of the magic ball. It directly covered the entire supreme world!</p>

    <p>The power of this explosion was astonishing. The volume of the explosion was also extremely astonishing. It reached an almost inaudible sound range... Therefore, this destruction was completely silent.</p>

    <p>The terrifying power exploded, causing the sky to crack and the earth to sink. Many beings in the universe who were extremely far away from the highest world felt this strange fluctuation. They either felt uneasy or directly roared on their own planet.</p>

    <p>An endless storm arose in an instant.</p>

    <p>It's a sight to behold. It's incredible. It's like the dawn of time.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui and those eternal strong men were extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>Even the Dao Ancestor Wang level battle back then had never reached this level...</p>

    <p>After the dust from the sky cleared, Ah Nuan girl's huge body was still at the forefront. But she didn't seem to have suffered any harm at all.</p>

    <p>Under such a huge explosion, there was just an extra layer of ashes on the face. It was really unbelievable.</p>

    <p>So now comes the key question.</p>

    <p>They all understand the truth...</p>

    <p>But what exactly is this three-petal Golden Lotus?</p>

    <p>In the Supreme Wrapped Corpse Map, a group of ancient strong men looked at each other. They had turned into a pile of bones and skeletons. But now they have become Wang Ling's portable encyclopedia and think tank. They all speculated and made suggestions here.</p>

    <p>After such a long time, many people have long given up hope of fighting their way out of the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>But now. The appearance of Wang Ling seems to have its own aura...</p>

    <p>This shining, sparkling young man allowed these ancient warriors who had been silent for a long time in the Corpse Map to regain hope and courage.</p>

    <p>Right now. This brother and sister are too strong...</p>

    <p>As long as you please one of them, it's probably not that difficult to have one of them to rescue us from the picture and "reincarnate" them.</p>

    <p>"Could it be. Is this another mystery object?" In the Corpse Map, some speculation.</p>

    <p>But he was quickly rejected: "Another mysterious thing? I don't think it looks like it."</p>

    <p>"That mysterious thing called destiny. Now the most likely result is the heart fragment of the outer god Sotos. And Fenmu Shen just got a little bit of it before inheriting the power of Sotos' bloodline..."</p>

    <p>"If the three-petal Golden Lotus is a mysterious object, it is impossible for him to be completely unaware of it. When he took action before, it was with a bit of hesitation and a look of being at a loss. It was as if he didn't know the existence of the three-petal Golden Lotus at all."</p>

    <p>"So what is this..."</p>

    <p>"I wonder if you have heard of it. Cosmic Embryo?"</p>

    <p>At this time, someone suddenly mentioned a new term.</p>

    <p>Regarding this matter, most of the Eternal Powers had blank expressions. Only Zhang Zhui seemed to have thought of something.</p>

    <p>He stared at the skeleton in front of him and frowned deeply: "Your Excellency's voice sounds familiar..."</p>

    <p>"I'm here. Star Wanderer Li Xian."</p>

    <p>"Li Xian..." just mentioned a name. Zhang Zhui had already recalled the face of this skeleton when he was alive.</p>

    <p>At that time, Li Xian was nicknamed "Star Traveler." The main reason was because of his rich adventure experience. Because of his rich experience, many people would call Li Xian when they went to explore secret places.</p>

    <p>Over time, he got such a nickname.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Li Xian is also his "old acquaintance."</p>

    <p>Because I always go to secret places, I have many treasures at home. Many of them are lost. In fact, they were all obtained by Zhang Zhuishun.</p>

    <p>"Do you know me?" At this time, Li Xian asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Not... not familiar..." Zhang Zhui shook his head.</p>

    <p>After all, he had gone to someone else's house to drop off some things before. He was afraid of being mentioned about the past, so he denied knowing Li Xian.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Li Xian actually recognized Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Because when Old God and Zhang Zhui were having an affair, Li Xian was under their bed...</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhang Zhui was captured first.</p>

    <p>Li Xian came in step by step, and there was a gap of time in between.</p>

    <p>So so far, no one knows the real reason why this reputable "Star Wanderer" came in...</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Li Xian was actually quite aggrieved when he was captured.</p>

    <p>Because when he met Old God, it was just to compose poetry.</p>

    <p>Old God is not his cup of tea at all.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why. When he heard someone outside the door looking for Old God, Li Xian was as nervous as a thief. He hid under the bed...</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more.</p>

    <p>Although when Dao Ancestor Wang captured Li Xian, Li Xian smiled and claimed that he and Old God were just "writing poetry."</p>

    <p>But obviously. This reason.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang did not agree...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wrapped inside the Corpse Map. The psychological struggle between several eternal warriors is very exciting.</p>

    <p>On the other side, thanks to Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. Wang Ling also knew about "Cosmic Embryo."</p>

    <p>According to Dao Ancestor Wang's notes, the legendary "Cosmic Embryo" is a natural eye located in the center of the universe. It has the power to see through all things in the universe.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this is an insight that only appears in legends...</p>

    <p>A unique existence in the universe.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling doesn't want this thing, it's impossible to give the "fetus" to the evil god in front of him in vain.</p>

    <p>So in the next second.</p>

    <p>In the second round, Wang Ling takes the lead.</p>

    <p>He frowned slightly, spread his fingers, and rushed towards Fenmu Shen's body. His giant hand sank directly into the huge bunch of "grapes." He stirred vigorously...</p>
