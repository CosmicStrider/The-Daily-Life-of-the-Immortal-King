  <h1>Chapter 1777 Red Lotus Valkyrieãƒ»Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Blood Lotus Female Butcher was extremely powerful. She really could not be compared with ordinary people. Seeing his anchor cut into pieces, Haiyao Jushi's face looked slightly ugly, but he did not show the slightest fear.</p>

    <p>He had already expected the strength of the "Blood Lotus Female Butcher" in front of him. But he didn't expect that she could cut into pieces the magic weapon refined from his own organs so cleanly.</p>

    <p>However, chopping up only one of his organs is ineffective because his organs have a regeneration mechanism. Unless they are all destroyed at the same time, they will continue to grow back.</p>

    <p>"Is this anchor with a chain made of his intestines and stomach?" Glio City Fenlei frowned and asked.</p>

    <p>"I forgot to mention." Wang Muyu also noticed it. He was originally worried whether Sun Rong could defeat Haiyao Jushi. However, seeing her looking so at ease, he immediately relaxed.</p>

    <p>"Mention?" Glio City Fenlei looked puzzled.</p>

    <p>"It's just stomach stones." Wang Muyu answered seriously.</p>

    <p>Stomach stones...</p>

    <p>The look of astonishment on the face of Glio City Fenlei did not diminish. He could not believe it. He did not expect that cultivators from the eternal era could be so heartless and crazy. They would not even let go of stomach stones and could refine them into their own magic weapons.</p>

    <p>But when he thought about it carefully, he felt that considering the way of thinking of the Eternal One, it was not strange to have such an idea.</p>

    <p>Because you can basically stand in the queue of the Eternal Ones and become one of them. As the earliest batch of cultivators in the universe, the Eternal Ones are almost all at the point where their bodies are sanctified. Since they are sanctifying their bodies, they grow up. Stomach stones are not called gastric stones.</p>

    <p>It's a kind of holy stone...</p>

    <p>It is a very special substance that grows in the stomach.</p>

    <p>In fact. Wang Ling heard Li Xian and Zhang Zhui say it before. Many cultivators from the Eternal Period wish they had more holy stones in their bodies. Because the formation of holy stones is very complicated and they are rare materials used for refining weapons. It can be taken out for personal use or sold. It will also have a certain market value throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>It's just that it's relatively rare for people like Haiyao Jushi to directly combine their own holy stones with their internal organs to refine them into magic weapons.</p>

    <p>The sea surface shrouded in purple spiritual light was filled with a chilling atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is seriously waiting to complete the first round of the contest. However, the opponent is an Eternal. Even if she is lucky enough to use the sword energy lingering outside her body to cut the opponent's anchor into tofu in the first round... still don't let down your guard.</p>

    <p>The lack of combat experience once made Sun Rong somewhat unconfident. This was also the reason why she did not dare to be careless.</p>

    <p>It's never wrong to be cautious.</p>

    <p>There was a burst of purple tide surrounded by sponges. It seemed to be a power originating from the deep sea. Along with the steaming mist, it turned into shadows in all directions.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Not long after, the core world began to shake. Sun Rong saw terrifying purple giant tails slapping the sea surface all around.</p>

    <p>That is the giant tail of a whale. It is as big as a hill. When it hits the sea, it creates thousands of waves. This is by no means an illusion. It is a purple whale summoned by Haiyao Jushi.</p>

    <p>It seems to have nothing to do with the way Haiyao Jushi uses his organs to refine magic weapons. But Wang Ling can see that these purple whales have been kept in his kidneys by Haiyao Jushi before.</p>

    <p>The so-called kidney organ is water. If it is used by an eternal person like Haiyao Jushi, its kidney organ can form a vast ocean of its own, and cultivate this sea into its own golden fishing ground, used to raise some special creatures in captivity.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>A large area of thunder and lightning erupted. Purple lightning shot up a huge thunder column on the sea. Along with the dense spider web-like electric streaks spread in all directions.</p>

    <p>This is the Blue Sea Chaotic Whale, a mythical beast bred in chaos. However, its development and the number of summoned at the same time were too huge, which made Wang Ling who was watching the battle feel a little surprised.</p>

    <p>From this point of view, Haiyao Jushi is an out-and-out professional fish farmer. He can actually keep so many chaotic beasts in captivity in his kidneys. He can also summon them at the same time in one breathing room.</p>

    <p>In terms of overall combat strength, Wang Ling feels that the strength of this Haiyao Jushi is even higher than that of Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>"Roar..." The Blue Sea Thundering Whale is so ferocious. It swings its huge tail and rolls up waves and thunder on the sea. Then it suddenly jumps out of the sea and flies in the air. The metacercaria is dozens of feet high. A large piece of thunder is heading towards Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Wherever it passed, everything was shattered into scorched earth.</p>

    <p>The evil spirit is fierce. It cannot be said that it is not cruel.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't say a word. She just urged Aohai with her thoughts.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Aohai's disguised red sword energy covered every part of Sun Rong's body. It bloomed on her body like the sun's fire. A huge red lotus appeared under Sun Rong's feet. Slowly lift her up to the sky.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the red lotus armor was added to her body. The girl was completely transformed at this moment. She became completely new.</p>

    <p>"Red Lotus Valkyrie..." Haiyao Jushi looked troubled. His face was extremely ugly. Although he had long expected that the Blood Lotus Maiden in front of him would be a very troublesome Eternal One, he did not think that his combat power was no match for her.</p>

    <p>Until this moment. He seemed to realize the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>This is the new form brought to Sun Rong by Aohai's red disguised sword energy. Even Sun Rong himself did not expect that he would actually get a brand new skin...</p>

    <p>Previously, after merging with Aohai Human Sword, she had obtained the "Blue Sea Tide Immortal Skirt Skin Form" and the "Nine-Core Powered Motorcycle Skin Form" under the blessing of nine-core Aohai.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't expect that she would change again today.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she was rising above the sky. The red lotus under her feet bloomed with infinite lotus.</p>

    <p>There was a buzzing sound. Sun Rong slashed out with a sword. Wherever the red sword energy passed, the entire space of the core world began to collapse! Countless cracks appeared while it was crumbling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, large amounts of blood splashed out. These terrifying giant beasts rolling in the sea were all split into two and turned into minced pepper fish heads.</p>

    <p>"I'm a whale in the blue sea..." Haiyao Jushi couldn't imagine that the Blood Lotus Female Butcher was so powerful.</p>

    <p>With just one sword, she cut all the twelve Blue Sea Mixed Whales in captivity into two halves.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not attack Haiyao Jushi directly. She could feel the power surging in her hand. Therefore, she controlled the power very carefully. She did not want to kill Haiyao Jushi directly.</p>

    <p>This man must know many secrets. If I can help Wang Ling capture him alive, we may be able to learn a lot of information.</p>

    <p>So she manipulated the sword energy to attack this core world.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the sword energy penetrated and chopped up the Blue Sea Thundering Whale and invaded the core world, causing a large number of gaps, the damage caused by the backlash immediately made Haiyao Jushi's face turn pale and he knelt on the ground.</p>

    <p>His expression changed on the spot.</p>

    <p>The power of Sun Rong's Aohai Red Lotus Sword Qi shook his core world to pieces...</p>
