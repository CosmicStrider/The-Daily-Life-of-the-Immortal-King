  <h1>Chapter 2018 God-making movement</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently. He was still young. After all, he was only 17 years old.</p>

    <p>Young people always lack some experience. Although Wang Ling has been tortured by strong strength since he was a child. He is afraid that he will blow up the earth accidentally.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, he found that he still loved life.</p>

    <p>And I think of human nature as very kind. There are not so many tricks and twists and turns.</p>

    <p>At least until you meet Jia Xiaoqiang, a thousand-year-old fox like Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>He never imagined that a person's human heart could be so sinister and complicated.</p>

    <p>If his judgment is correct, using meteorites to project to the earth may be just a part of Bai Zhe's plan.</p>

    <p>Soul planting. Maybe that's the key.</p>

    <p>But it is actually not easy to thoroughly investigate soul planting. Because there are many methods of soul planting.</p>

    <p>If it were Bai Zhe. Thinking based on his logic, what choice would he make?</p>

    <p>This old fox will definitely choose the most secretive method.</p>

    <p>Then there are only two methods.</p>

    <p>The first method is to first find a suitable physical body. It is similar to the method used by the old devil during the military training exercises in the sixth school.</p>

    <p>For example, find the skeleton of a powerful person. Then use special psychic clay to simulate the physical body to fill the skeleton. Finally, transfer the soul to this physical body.</p>

    <p>But it is actually not easy to match a suitable body.</p>

    <p>And the process inside is very complicated. Mingyue Ye came to the earth not long ago. Without strengthening his own foundation, it is unrealistic to use money and modern technology to achieve this kind of operation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if you follow the first method of soul planting, all that is left is tomb robbing...</p>

    <p>Soul planting by digging up the remains of ancient cultivators.</p>

    <p>This is the cheapest and most practical method.</p>

    <p>Once the soul is successfully planted, it can be put into use immediately.</p>

    <p>The second method is to use external factors to directly seize the body.</p>

    <p>The advantage of this is that it is more concealed than the first form of tomb robbing, and it is difficult to detect abnormalities.</p>

    <p>As for the object of the body snatching, according to many rebirth and time travel routines, they must be some inconspicuous little characters. For example, a good-looking loser with almost zero cultivation talent. Or a handsome guy who is frail and sick and seems to die at any time. </p>

    <p>That's right. These people have nothing but skin and no qualifications for cultivation.</p>

    <p>Even in the context of modern scientific cultivation, if you don't have the slightest qualification for cultivation and are unwilling to work hard, it will be a matter of time before you are eliminated by the cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, it is these ordinary inconspicuous people. Now there is the possibility of being planted with souls.</p>

    <p>This idea is very bold. But it is indeed being cleaned up.</p>

    <p>Soul planting sounds somewhat similar to Sun Ying'er's previous void creature invasion. But in fact it is fundamentally different.</p>

    <p>Because a void is a void. It's another race. Wang Ling can be easily identified using King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>But the souls planted are the souls of serious human cultivators.</p>

    <p>In other words, there may be many hidden Eternals who, following the logic of Wang Ling, will possess those cultivators who were originally inconspicuous and live in human cities.</p>

    <p>Until the day Bai Zhe gave the order. The inside and outside cooperated to take down the earth in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough. Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang collected most of the Eternals into the Corpse Map. Is there a reason..." Wang Ling thought to himself.</p>

    <p>He felt that Dao Ancestor Wang must have a reason for his actions.</p>

    <p>Now, with the revelation of each incident, he feels more and more that Dao Ancestor Wang's actions are actually for precaution.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Guo Hao and Chen Chao haven't left the game yet. Sun Rong here has successfully entered the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>How to dig out those cultivators who are soul-planted and hidden on the earth. Wang Ling thinks this matter. Sun Rong may be able to help.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuquemen Student Street. In a private room of a prosperous pancake and fruit shop.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong woke up from lying on the table with the smell of pancakes and fruits.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, are you awake?"</p>

    <p>The people smiling at her were none other than Immortal Toya, who was dressed in disguise and wrapped himself tightly. There was also Wang Ling, who was eating crispy noodles filled with pancakes and fruit.</p>

    <p>"I remember that I seemed to be practicing..."Sun Rong rubbed his face and said.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Miss Sun has successfully broken through to the early stage of the Golden Core in the Mountain of Retrospection. Congratulations." Immortal Toya said with a smile: "This is the Chenji Pancake and Fruit Chain Store in Suzaku Gate."</p>

    <p>"Chen Ji..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong searched the memory. Then suddenly it came to mind: "By the way. It's the name of Mr. Chen's pancake and fruit shop in front of 60 High School."</p>

    <p>She was a little surprised. She didn't expect that Mr. Chen would open a chain store so quickly...</p>

    <p>And this store is ridiculously big.</p>

    <p>It was also the first time she knew that there were private rooms in the pancake and fruit shop!</p>

    <p>"Miss Jiugong seems to be very passionate about pancakes and fruits, so she helped Uncle Chen open a branch in Zhuquemen Student Street."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya said while sipping tea. Because the private room was quiet and no one was disturbing or eavesdropping, his discussion was quite open: "After you broke through the Golden Core, Ling Zhenren found me. He said he wanted to get me with you. Let's discuss something together."</p>

    <p>"Then that's why I came here..." At this time, Sun Rong glanced at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"That's right. It was Ling Zhenren who carried you here before Miss Sun woke up." Immortal Toya said so shockingly that all of a sudden, Sun Rong was confused.</p>

    <p>"Back... carried on your back? In front of so many people?" Her face was red and her words were a bit incoherent.</p>

    <p>"Ah. Sorry. It was my choice of words."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled: "That posture shouldn't be considered a back. It's a carry. Yes. It's carried over!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren carried you and teleported here. But please don't worry, Miss Sun. There were not many people in the student street at that time. Almost no one saw you."</p>

    <p>"Ha. Haha. That's really hard work for classmate Wang Ling..." Sun Rong couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>"Ahem..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling coughed slightly and stopped the topic.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya quickly got back to business: "Well, I came to see Miss Sun this time. Actually, I want to ask Miss Sun for help. The current situation is like this..."</p>

    <p>After spending a few minutes sorting out Wang Ling's inferences, Sun Rong finally understood what kind of inferences Wang Ling had made during his coma.</p>

    <p>"According to what Senior Toya wants, that is to say, we need to use the power of our Sun family's Huaguo Shuilian Group to find those who may have souls planted, right?" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Especially those cultivators who are not strong and inconspicuous to begin with. The possibility of them being soul-planted is very high."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya said: "However, as a high-level powerful person, when he possesses a relatively weak body, he usually uses his own means to transform the body. Refining elixirs and taking elixirs to change the body are routine operations."</p>

    <p>"That is to say, in the following days, those cultivators who are obviously not strong but are buying precious spiritual plants to refine elixirs or trying to make elixirs, as well as those cultivators whose cultivation qualifications have undergone earth-shaking changes in a short period of time. He is a suspicious person."</p>

    <p>"I understand, senior. Our Huaguo Shuilian Group has controlled the elixir market for many years. I believe it shouldn't be difficult to monitor. But there is still one thing I don't know."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, please tell me."</p>

    <p>"Whether buying spiritual plants or refining elixirs, you need funds. So where does their money come from?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun underestimates these powerful people. www.uukanshu.net Since they can become powerful people in the eternal era and are the leaders of that era, then even in modern times, they still have their own means of making money."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya said: "According to Ling Zhenren's analysis, after the soul is planted, they will also obtain the memory of the original owner of the body on earth. Therefore, it is much easier to adapt to modern life than it was for senior Zhang Zhui and senior Li Xian. many."</p>

    <p>"It seems that this is the god-making movement launched by Bai Zhe. It is indeed very dangerous." Sun Rong sighed.</p>

    <p>"His intention has been seen through by Ling Zhenren. All we have to do next is to counterattack. So, we have to trouble Miss Sun about the monitoring. There is another thing that we have to ask Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>"Senior, please tell me." Sun Rong replied politely.</p>

    <p>She was clear in her heart. In fact, Immortal Toya's request was tantamount to Wang Ling's plan. She had no reason to refuse.</p>

    <p>"I would like to ask Miss Sun whether she is qualified to enter the Sun family's ancestral land?"</p>
