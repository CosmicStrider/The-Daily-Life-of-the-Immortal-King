  <h1>Chapter 1567 The Great Solitary and Widow Technique</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Today is another day of overtime work for Jiang Xiaoche, because it is almost time to get off work.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was summoned by Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>There are a variety of snacks and popcorn of different flavors on the old man's table. He even hired a pastry chef to make desserts on site.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jiang Xiaoche feel a little familiar.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the time subconsciously. He was also confused by Boss Sun's behavior.</p>

    <p>This time is not the match node of the World Cup.</p>

    <p>It's not the time for the League of Kings S99 Global Finals.</p>

    <p>It's not the time to watch TV dramas and variety shows that Mr. Boss Sun loves to watch.</p>

    <p>The recently popular variety show {Brothers Making Trouble} is Boss Sun's favorite.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is a fashionable old man. In order to catch up with the footsteps of young people and better understand the market of young people, he never resists learning new things.</p>

    <p>But the formation in front of me is rare.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoche, sit down, sit down. I'm worried that no one will accompany me to watch the game." Boss Sun called out.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun fiddled with the magic ball on the table. A three-dimensional holographic image in the void was immediately displayed.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Jiang Xiaoche looked at this scene with a slight hesitation.</p>

    <p>Because of the scene in front of him, he instantly noticed a familiar person.</p>

    <p>It's that pretty boy named Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"This is the live broadcast of the competition where classmate Wang Ling goes to Sun Island to be an exchange student." Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was a little confused: "But I remember. Wasn't classmate Wang Ling participating in a closed-door competition..."</p>

    <p>Because of the business connection with Sun Island, Jiang Xiaoche actually has a certain level of understanding of things on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi's 2 billion order. It was Sun Rong who found him before and asked him to coordinate the signing.</p>

    <p>"So I paid a certain price." Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>"The price?"</p>

    <p>"Isn't this organizer the Sun Island Ten Thousand Schools Alliance? I agreed to help them be the title investor for a subsequent large-scale competition. That's why I got this video."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoche felt a little sour for no reason.</p>

    <p>"But sir, I still don't know why you called me here..."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing special. Chat with me. It's also your secretary-general's responsibility."</p>

    <p>"Sir, I have to be with my partner today..."</p>

    <p>"Don't do this. In front of me, you still want to pretend that you have a girlfriend. You may have many female companions. But to this day, you are still a lonely old man. Don't pretend that I don't know."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words were like a whip that struck Jiang Xiaoche's heart deeply, causing him to freeze on the spot.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun said: "Sit down. This time I am looking for you. I want to watch the game with you and then have a casual chat. I think you have always misunderstood your classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoche was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>He thought that no one else would know what he was doing.</p>

    <p>But I never thought that I would not be able to escape the old man's eyes after all.</p>

    <p>The boss in front of me, Mr. Sun, is the one who hides the deepest.</p>

    <p>"Sit down, Xiaoche." Boss Sun smiled kindly.</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>The kind light in his eyes was like the spring breeze blowing on his face. Jiang Xiaoche couldn't refuse. At the same time, he felt ashamed.</p>

    <p>He dared not look directly into Boss Sun's eyes.</p>

    <p>Just sit with me on one side.</p>

    <p>As he watched, Jiang Xiaoche found that this game seemed a little different from what he imagined.</p>

    <p>Why does that local student on Sun Island keep slapping himself...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the battle between Wang Ling and Yonekura Eaki continues.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Yonekura Eaki resisted the issue of match-fixing at first.</p>

    <p>However, the conditions offered to him by Ueki Kimisan were too good.</p>

    <p>It has always been his dream to study abroad. His grades in Sangtian High School were excellent. He received generous scholarships every year. However, it was unrealistic to achieve his goal of studying abroad with these meager scholarships.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the school only has a few recommended places for overseas study every year. You can count them on your fingers.</p>

    <p>It is said that students with the best grades will be selected to go there.</p>

    <p>However, once it is put into practice, these quotas are destined to be reserved for those with connections.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Eaki has no background and power, and no financial resources. To get this recommended spot is just a dream.</p>

    <p>So Yonekura Weiming had already made plans.</p>

    <p>He knew clearly that match-fixing... was actually a very shameful thing, but he was still willing to do it.</p>

    <p>Because now he is nothing.</p>

    <p>The only thing I can do is to endure it for the time being and become someone else's pawn.</p>

    <p>As long as you can get through this day and wait until the day you can officially breathe the free air of Mixiu Country, everything will be worth it.</p>

    <p>And what he has to do is to be patient.</p>

    <p>To fight against match-fixing, you have to have a fake match...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched Yonekura Weiming slap his face with one palm after another. The thoughts in his heart were inexplicably complicated.</p>

    <p>Like the Wang family, they are actually just ordinary ordinary people. However, Wang Ling has been under the influence of Father Wang and Mother Wang since they were young. They know how to be content than anyone else.</p>

    <p>Studying abroad. Wang Ling has never occurred to me.</p>

    <p>Because the moon is the same all over the world. Even if you go abroad, the moon may not be rounder.</p>

    <p>But just because he thinks so, it doesn't mean that other people think the same way as him.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming wants to "rise up." He wants to obtain better resources and use his own efforts to let his family live a better life.</p>

    <p>This in itself is actually not wrong.</p>

    <p>"Why did that person hit himself?" Zhou Ziyi was confused in front of the TV.</p>

    <p>"It should be that we have an agreement with a certain party. We want to drag my apprentice into trouble by fixing matches." Zhuo Yi took a salt and pepper strip and put it in Jiugong Liangzi's bowl.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jiugong Liangzi feel better. But then he saw Zhuo Yi pick up another one and put it in Zhou Ziyi's bowl.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>"The way to determine match-fixing on Sun Island is very simple. The first is to judge the basic combat power. The second is to judge the overall performance of the entire game based on the combat power. As long as the side with the higher combat power is suspected of cheating, it will be easy. It was judged to be a match-fixing. Then both parties were disqualified."</p>

    <p>"Isn't classmate Wang Ling in danger?" Zhou Ziyi stared at the screen intently.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if he encountered such a situation, he would definitely not know what to do.</p>

    <p>He wanted to take a look at how Wang Ling was handled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Yonekura Weiming slap himself one slap after another. There were interlaced five finger prints on his originally thin face.</p>

    <p>He struck very hard. No worse than Sakai Kazuya before him.</p>

    <p>These slaps on the face actually used internal energy. Yonekura Weiaki deliberately inflicted internal injuries on himself.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling can actually see it.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiaki didn't want to do that.</p>

    <p>While he was slapping himself, tears couldn't stop rolling down the corners of his eyes.</p>

    <p>They are silent tears.</p>

    <p>It's not because of pain.</p>

    <p>The moment he faced Yonekura Weiming, Wang Ling already knew everything.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan's request to Yonekura Eaki was to injure him as much as possible and then fall to the ground and pretend to be dead... deliberately allowing Wang Ling to win, thus making a false match determination.</p>

    <p>In other words, there are many ways to determine match-fixing.</p>

    <p>But Yonekura Weiaki chose one.</p>

    <p>In a non-hurtful way.</p>

    <p>Because the end result is the same. He just needs to achieve the purpose of match-fixing.</p>

    <p>Although he knew that it was extremely unfair to Wang Ling that he chose to study abroad in this way.</p>

    <p>Even if it doesn't harm Wang Ling, it will give Wang Ling a bad reputation for match-fixing.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiaki can't think of any way to compensate...</p>

    <p>This is the only way to do it.</p>

    <p>So many years...</p>

    <p>He got through it all.</p>

    <p>He was powerless and drifted on this small island of cultivation just to enable his family to live a better life.</p>

    <p>While slapping myself.</p>

    <p>Shame, resistance and the intense loneliness of struggling alone suddenly came to his mind.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming's tears couldn't stop falling.</p>

    <p>At this time, he saw Wang Ling walking forward slowly with his trouser pockets inserted, slowly approaching him.</p>

    <p>"No... don't come near me! Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiaki's face was so swollen that he could not speak.</p>

    <p>But my heart was roaring.</p>

    <p>He thought that no one could understand his helplessness and loneliness.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, when Wang Ling gradually approached him and looked at him with his eyes.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Yonekura Weiming suddenly felt that his mind went blank. He actually fell into fragments.</p>

    <p>"This... what is this..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, an empty universe appeared in Yonekura Weiming's mind.</p>

    <p>The universe is boundless. Not even a single star. He saw the solitary figure of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming's heart was instantly touched.</p>

    <p>He couldn't imagine the picture in his mind.</p>

    <p>He thought he was already the loneliest person in the world.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that the young man standing in front of him would feel far more lonely than himself...</p>

    <p>The feeling of helplessness, loneliness, and loneliness spread like a reptile. All of a sudden, Yonekura Weiming's mind fell into a state of emptiness.</p>

    <p>Others can't tell what happened...</p>

    <p>I saw Yonekura Weiming's body softening and falling forward.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully caught his body and slowly laid him flat on the ground.</p>

    <p>That move just now was called {Great Lonely and Widow Technique}...</p>

    <p>It is also one of the gentler spells among Wang Ling's current Heavenly Dao spells.</p>

    <p>There are no side effects.</p>

    <p>The practitioner will feel Wang Ling one in a billion loneliness... and then gradually stop thinking under the impact of this loneliness.</p>

    <p>So, Yonekura Weiming closed his eyes without any surprise.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the young man on the ground. There was no trace of emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, he cast a spiritual light on Yonekura Weiming's face.</p>

    <p>The bloated face that had been almost deformed by Yonekura Eaki's own whip was instantly restored to its original state.</p>
