  <h1>Chapter 1604 Jisaki's road becomes wider</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A grand celebration ceremony was held in the treehouse of Jiudaohe High School around "Wang Houlang" who was the first high school student to reach the summit of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Previously, this place was originally used as a place for Class S students to show off their superiority.</p>

    <p>But now as the scale of Gray Cult has further expanded, although Jiudaohe still maintains the classification system on the surface, in fact the discrimination in all aspects has been greatly reduced.</p>

    <p>Those Class S students who used to look at people through their nostrils have also become humble. At least when they see students in lower-level classes, most of them will no longer assume that condescending attitude.</p>

    <p>Even in the corner of the campus, you can see harmonious scenes of students from Class S publicly instructing students in lower-level classes.</p>

    <p>Campus equality.</p>

    <p>This is the general trend.</p>

    <p>At present, Jisaki has applied in the name of the head of the Gray Cult branch to abolish the hierarchical mechanism. I believe this will be responded to soon.</p>

    <p>As for some very few people who like to bully others, the Jiugong family will never tolerate such issues easily after they take over Jiudaohe High School again.</p>

    <p>The morning of the next day. That is, the morning of Monday, December 21st.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan was indicted by the Sun Island police and prosecutors on suspicion of abuse of power and bribery. When he left Jiudaohe in handcuffs, his back standing at the school gate looked slightly depressed.</p>

    <p>But no one has the slightest sympathy for Ueki Kimisan.</p>

    <p>He has gone crazy. His eyes are covered with red bloodshot eyes. His mental condition has become very unstable.</p>

    <p>Everyone feels it. That person is from Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>"You! Are you from Gray Cult? You must be from Gray Cult too! You...you are all in the same group! Liar! Big liar!" Ueki Kimisan roared hysterically. His body twisted crazily. However, the police used a large hand to hold him tightly.</p>

    <p>Because they were worried that this resistance might cause the suspect to be injured during transportation, the police here reluctantly applied a "sedation technique" to Ueki Kimisan.</p>

    <p>When they were being sent to the car, Aoshiro Ichiro, the captain of the local police station in charge of the case, smiled coldly: "Sedation + sleepy black tea. This guy must have slept for dozens of hours."</p>

    <p>"His mental condition is very unstable. Is it really okay?"</p>

    <p>"Don't look at him like this. He's probably just faking it. The psychiatrist has already come to evaluate him. He's mentally normal."</p>

    <p>Police captain Aoshiro Ichiro said: "Using mental illness to escape legal sanctions does not work here. I hate this kind of people the most. I will definitely give this guy a few more years in prison."</p>

    <p>In fact.</p>

    <p>The psychiatrist was sent by Jiugong's family.</p>

    <p>And...</p>

    <p>At the request of Jiugong Akagi, the head of the Jiugong family, the doctor also joined Gray Cult...</p>

    <p>So in the process of escorting Ueki Kimisan.</p>

    <p>Gray Cult has become a new topic of conversation among the accompanying police officers.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, this Gray Cult... is probably just a student literary organization, right? Why is it so powerful?" a police officer asked.</p>

    <p>He is not a child.</p>

    <p>But there are really a lot of question marks.</p>

    <p>A student literary club. Behind it, the Office of Strategic Deception, Huaguo Shuilian Group, Jiugong Family and first-class sects from various countries have come forward to support...</p>

    <p>These are all world-renowned sects and consortiums in the world today.</p>

    <p>It's really incredible that he would secretly help a small literary club.</p>

    <p>"Don't think too much. It's just a coincidence." Aoshiro Ichiro said.</p>

    <p>His expression looked nonchalant.</p>

    <p>In fact...this was the result of the boss giving him some advice. Gray Cult adheres to the principle of keeping a low profile. Therefore, regarding Gray Cult's matters, department leaders at all levels have specifically instructed that no discussion is allowed internally or externally.</p>

    <p>Officer Aoshiro Ichiro knows this alone. This is something he shouldn't know.</p>

    <p>So it was for his own good and for the sake of his subordinates. Since the superior asked them to act as if they didn't know, he should have obeyed this order.</p>

    <p>Therefore, no matter who in the team, whenever someone mentions Gray Cult, Aoshiro Ichiro will act nonchalant.</p>

    <p>"Captain, do you want to join Gray Cult?" Someone asked again at this time.</p>

    <p>"It's a student organization. What's the point of joining? How many years have we graduated? Is there really anyone who would join Gray Cult? No way?" Aoshiro Ichiro chuckled and scoffed.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile on the other side.</p>

    <p>In the Jiudaohe student office. Ma Jiao is entering the new batch of Gray Cult member lists into the computer.</p>

    <p>She tapped on the keyboard and typed the first name.</p>

    <p>Aoshiro Ichiro...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's group returned home at 8 o'clock that evening. They took the Jiugong family's express flight. They also used the Jiugong family's private immortal boat.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family's matter was perfectly resolved. Wang Ling also received the bonus for buying gifts for Ah Nuan girl. Everything seemed to have no other regrets.</p>

    <p>Calculated from the itinerary. Wang Ling can return to the Wang family villa with gifts that night.</p>

    <p>In a separate room in the wooden house. With Jisaki's careful arrangement, Wang Ling was able to be isolated from the fanatical Gray Cult believers outside.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was giving a thank-you speech outside. The bursts of applause and laughter suddenly gave Wang Ling a special sense of peace of mind.</p>

    <p>He was grateful to the girl in his heart.</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong wasn't here...he wouldn't know how to deal with this situation.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. Will there be a chance to see you again in the future?" Compared to the joyful atmosphere outside, Jisaki, who was already very familiar with Wang Ling in the wooden house, showed a very sentimental expression.</p>

    <p>He felt reluctant to give up.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't spend a long time with Wang Ling, he felt that he had been conquered by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Jisaki has been busy these past two days. In fact, Wang Ling has seen it all.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that he is really considerate. He has thought of almost everything.</p>

    <p>This is also the first foreign friend Wang Ling has made.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is naturally very cherished.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how he should express his gratitude, so he gave Jisaki a set of enlightened 60 High School uniforms.</p>

    <p>The weather in Sun Island is hot. I don't need thermal underwear or anything like that. Wang Ling thinks it's not as practical as sending school uniforms.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this set of school uniforms is different from the ones I initiated at the beginning. It is a completely new one.</p>

    <p>This is the 60 High School uniform that was enlightened using the Wang Ling 3.0 version of the {Great Attunement Technique}. It is extremely strong! Even if it travels to the universe, it will be fine!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is wearing the same outfit now.</p>

    <p>This is also the main reason why Wang Ling wears school uniforms and fights in various spaces. The school uniforms remain intact.</p>

    <p>If it had been anyone else, their clothes would have been in tatters.</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way! Houlang Sang! I...I also have a gift for you!" Jisaki wiped away his tears. He also gave the gift he had prepared to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There are two things in total.</p>

    <p>One of them is a set of pink one-piece baby pajamas. It has a very cute bear pattern on it.</p>

    <p>The other item is the limited edition "Sun Crispy Noodles" on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>It is said that this crispy noodle is made in a very special way. It is baked by the sun! There is a taste of nature in it...</p>

    <p>Saw these two things.</p>

    <p>Of course...mainly the second thing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt that his Number 60 High School uniform seemed like a too light gift...</p>
