  <h1>Chapter 1833 Gray Cult branch in Glio City is established</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Perhaps it is due to the sensitive thinking of entrepreneurial successors. After comprehensive analysis, Sun Rong finally came up with this answer that sounded unexpected but seemed completely reasonable.</p>

    <p>This was a conversation between her and Lawen. There was no outsider in this room. After seeing Mrs. Lawen silently take a cigar from her pocket and light it, Sun Rong began her further reasoning: " The recording of a variety show has caused a big mess. It will definitely not be broadcast. Madam, you have suffered a loss. But you are still willing to transfer control of Walwolf to me as promised. This is unreasonable."</p>

    <p>"You think it's unreasonable?"</p>

    <p>Lady Lawen said: "The entire city of Glio is filled with my properties. I'm just fulfilling my promise. No need to make a fuss."</p>

    <p>"I just thought it was sudden."</p>

    <p>"You think it's sudden?" Mrs. Lawen smiled meaningfully: "I don't think it's sudden. It's just like Mr. Huang who suddenly paid the fake county magistrate to suppress the bandits in Goose City. Everything was planned. It's just a matter of course. In the end, both Ms. Sun and I gained our own benefits."</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mrs. Lawen has admitted that she is Mr. Yuan Zun's person?" Sun Rong asked politely.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Or no. Does it still matter to Miss Sun Rong now?"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen paused and said: "The cause of all things is indeed due to Master Yuan Zun's consideration of the checks and balances of all parties, which led to such a result. It's just that neither Master Yuan Zun nor I expected that this would happen." During the recording of the variety show, they started fighting. This way, Mr. Yuan Zun would have a reason to cause trouble for them and weaken their foundation."</p>

    <p>"This is what Madam said, the benefits?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Lawen nodded honestly and said, "Wolwolf's loss is not a loss to me at all. Because I can get better projects from Lord Yuan Zun. Of course. Wolwolf control rights are transferred to you. In fact, this is what Mr. Yuan Zun meant. You are absolutely right. As an entrepreneur, it is impossible to give away your money in vain when you have already lost it."</p>

    <p>"Is there any condition?" asked Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"It's a very simple condition." Mrs. Lawen said this and took out an exquisite notebook from her arms. It was wrapped in pure gold.</p>

    <p>When it was handed over to Sun Rong, Sun Rong clearly felt a heavy feeling.</p>

    <p>At this time, Mrs. Lawen slowly spoke: "I heard that you know the leader of Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was obviously stunned.</p>

    <p>"Master Yuan Zun said. This is a literary organization. And the president of this organization is a person who studies at Number 60 High School. You should know this person, right? As far as I know, he is a greasy and passionate man with big hands and eyes."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>She suspected that the person Mrs. Lawen was talking about was a combination of Chen Chao and Guo Hao!</p>

    <p>Of course. What shocked her even more was that she didn't expect Gray Cult's influence to be so great that even the Head of State of the Cultivation Country knew about it...</p>

    <p>"eh...I know..." After thinking for a moment, Sun Rong nodded and said.</p>

    <p>"This is the notebook of Mr. Yuan Zun's grandson. He has been very interested in literature recently and hopes to join the Gray Cult. If possible, I hope you can help get the Gray Cult leader to sign his name on the title page of the notebook."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned. She was very careful. She thought over and over whether there was any other purpose or trap here.</p>

    <p>However, this cautious expression made Mrs. Lawen laugh again: "Look at you. It doesn't matter if you are cautious. Whether you get this signature or not, it doesn't prevent Lord Yuan Zun from ordering me to give up Wolwolf. It's your decision. If you have any concerns, just return this notebook to me."</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out of his mouth, Sun Rong suddenly felt that her rank was lower after all. Compared with these experienced female entrepreneurs abroad, she was indeed a little too inexperienced.</p>

    <p>This is obviously a way of retreating into advancement.</p>

    <p>It makes Sun Rong lose face. She has to agree.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Rong has always prided herself on being generous. It would be a bit too magnanimous to refuse like this.</p>

    <p>She was cautious because she was worried that Gray Cult's existence would be used by people with ulterior motives. A cultivator's Head of State suddenly targeted such a literary organization. From Sun Rong's perspective, it was not a good thing.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong even suspected that there might be some problems with this notebook. She did not dare to check it directly in front of Mrs. Lawen. So she thought about it again and again, and then said smoothly: "It can be signed. But the president has gone abroad. So I am afraid. I will send it to you, madam, after I return to Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Mrs. Lawen nodded hurriedly: "That's good. Let's leave it like that. Your case has been dismissed. The restraining order has also been cancelled. Returning to Huaxiu is no longer a problem."</p>

    <p>"Well. Then after I return to Huaxiu, I will sign it and send it to Madam immediately."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said like this, pretending to be a snake. In fact, she already had a countermeasure in mind.</p>

    <p>What is the intention behind asking for the Gray Cult leader's signature? Sun Rong It is not clear yet.</p>

    <p>But has the notebook been tampered with in any other way? With her current state, she can still test it after she returns. If it doesn't work... there is Wang Ling here. She can tell Wang Ling about this. Let Wang Ling use his own eyesight to see what is fishy here.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon, everyone at Number 60 High School set out on their journey. Before leaving, the representatives of the first-year high school students from Uzumaki Number 1 High School in Glio City were represented. They were the six prodigies who participated in the variety show challenge with Number 60 High School this time. Captain Su Kewei led the other five magical powers to officially join the Gray Cult and announced the establishment of the Gray Cult branch in Glio City.</p>

    <p>This is the second cultivation country to have a Gray Cult branch after Sun Island...</p>

    <p>And just like the Jiudaohe High School in Sun Island, the Uzumaki Imperial High School located in Glio City is also a famous high school in this cultivation country! It has consistently ranked first in the national cultivation college rankings all year round!</p>

    <p>Nowadays, these two ace high schools are leaving the shadow of Number 60 High School, which makes Wang Ling, Sun Rong very emotional...</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong established Gray Cult, Wang Ling didn't care much about it.</p>

    <p>He just thought it would be nice to have Gray Cult cover for him.</p>

    <p>Who knows that this Gray Cult can be managed by Sun Rong in such a spectacular way...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so shocked that he was speechless.</p>

    <p>These are the times when we need cultural export. In the era of cultural invasion from major cultivating countries, it is really a matter of great pride to carry forward local cultivating culture abroad.</p>

    <p>At first, this "grain of ashes in the era" seemed very light and weightless. But it was unintentionally inserted into the willow tree and became a heavy seed in the export of foreign culture...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is a little curious. How far can Gray Cult develop in the end?</p>
