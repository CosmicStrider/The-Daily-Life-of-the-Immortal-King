  <h1>Chapter 1502 Mrs. 6 is targeted</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facts have proven that people's imagination is always limited by their own experiences.</p>

    <p>After Zhai Yin finished speaking, the venue fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt helpless in his heart.</p>

    <p>Of course, Zhai Yin is not to blame for this incident. It is mainly because of the series of operations he just dealt with "Zhang Sacrifice." This scene is really too small. It is far from breaking through the scope of Zhai Yin's understanding.</p>

    <p>If Zhai Yin was the same as Sun Rong last time. He witnessed the battle between Wang Ling and Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>You would never come to such a conclusion.</p>

    <p>"Did I say something wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" Zhai Yin was puzzled. She tilted her head and there was an obvious big question mark on her forehead.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed out loud. He couldn't help but rub Zhai Yin's face with his hands.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing..." Zhai Yin was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"I just think you are a bit cute, Yinzi." Wang Ming smiled and said, "Why do you think I care so little about you..."</p>

    <p>"Don't do this. It won't be good for others to see." Zhai Yin blushed.</p>

    <p>"We are all our own, so why should we be embarrassed? Besides, Mr. Yingxian hasn't come back from the toilet yet." Wang Ming didn't mean to be polite at all. He just lay down on her and hugged her like a piece of brown sugar.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin smiled helplessly and frowned quickly: "Speaking of which, Mr. Yingxian seems to have been in there for a while. Why hasn't he come out yet?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. It seems like it's been a long time since we got in."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming used Wang Ling's perspective heat sensor to take a look. He found that Yingxian Heming was still squatting.</p>

    <p>It doesn't look like there's anything unusual.</p>

    <p>A cultivator with a normal diet usually does not suffer from constipation. However, it does happen that it takes a long time to go to the toilet.</p>

    <p>Usually, the higher the level, the longer the interval between each bowel movement.</p>

    <p>This is why many high-level cultivators do not need to go to the toilet during retreat.</p>

    <p>In fact, this mainly depends on personal habits.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Wang Ling is more accustomed to doing whatever he wants in this regard.</p>

    <p>If you feel like it, go squat on the toilet.</p>

    <p>When you are not in the mood, you can directly transfer the inventory in your stomach or bladder.</p>

    <p>Directly connected to Lord Ma's space and transferred to Lord Ma's belly.</p>

    <p>Just press your belly button...one click to clear.</p>

    <p>However, if Wang Ling chooses to squat on the toilet, then you can only squat on Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>After all, Lord Ma was personally enlightened by Wang Ling. She has a relatively strong tolerance.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, use another ordinary toilet. Wang Ling has just released himself. The huge recoil will make Wang Ling look like a pilot. He sits on the toilet and takes off...</p>

    <p>"Just wait a little longer." Wang Ming shrugged helplessly.</p>

    <p>According to the cyclical defecation patterns of cultivators on the {Encyclopedia of Cultivation}, Yingxian Heming has obviously been in a cage for a long time. I'm afraid he won't be able to get out for a while.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Wang Ling was helping Zhang Sacrifice ferry back, Wang Ming actually vaguely heard the noise in the toilet.</p>

    <p>The sound of the toilet flushing was like a ghost. It came one after another.</p>

    <p>It looks like there is still a while. Wang Ling is not idle either.</p>

    <p>Because of "Zhang Sacrifice."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he must warn the sixth lady who has been behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>The other party manipulates ghosts to commit crimes.</p>

    <p>Such criminal evidence is actually difficult to obtain.</p>

    <p>With the character of this sixth lady, once she realizes that her affairs will be exposed, she will immediately cut off her connection with ghosts.</p>

    <p>As long as the ghosts are eliminated, then there will be no evidence of death.</p>

    <p>However. As long as there is no undocumented certificate.</p>

    <p>It seems that witness is also a way out.</p>

    <p>But you must know that Wang Ling's strength is still hidden in front of strangers.</p>

    <p>Although those close to him know that he is very strong.</p>

    <p>But if he goes to the police, in the eyes of the police he is still an ordinary high school student in the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>Especially since this place is still abroad. The person being reported is the eldest lady of the Zhai Xing Group who is said to have married into the Jiugong family. She is now the sixth wife of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Therefore, no one will believe what a foreign high school student says... and go head-to-head with Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in order to bring down this Sixth Lady, mastering the "real hammer" is crucial.</p>

    <p>He expected that there must be many artificially created ghosts like "Zhang Sacrifice" in the hands of the sixth lady.</p>

    <p>They may be "guardian spirits", "lucky spirits" and the like. In other words, in a broad sense: good ghosts.</p>

    <p>Since the Sixth Lady has the power to make ghosts distort their memories.</p>

    <p>Then by distorting the memory, it makes those "good ghosts" have strong resentment, thereby creating powerful ghosts with strong resentment... It is definitely not difficult for the Sixth Lady.</p>

    <p>At this time, while Mr. Yingxian Heming was still in trouble.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is passing King's Eyes. Quietly watching the movements of Madam Six.</p>

    <p>Jiugong's house. In the sixth lady's mansion, in front of a huge dressing mirror, the sixth lady is combing her waterfall-like hair with a mahogany comb.</p>

    <p>Combing and combing, her hand suddenly stopped. Then she pulled out a piece of white hair from the wooden comb.</p>

    <p>This just came out of her hair.</p>

    <p>Immediately, Madam Six's eyes dimmed.</p>

    <p>In front of the mirror, she started talking to herself.</p>

    <p>The scenes and specific sounds happening in the room are all within the scope of Wang Ling's prying eyes.</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady spoke. That seemed to be the Sixth Lady's original intention. The Queen's voice was domineering and female.</p>

    <p>"Huh. The contact with Pashan Gui was actually broken?"</p>

    <p>Then she spoke again. It was a sharp and harsh voice. It had an evil feeling.</p>

    <p>"Yes... I feel that he ascended to heaven. Although I don't know what happened. He became a guardian spirit again... and entered reincarnation..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Um?</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady... So she's psychotic?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. He realized something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Of course this is a joke.</p>

    <p>The same body makes two completely different sounds.</p>

    <p>Let's look at the actual situation of Mrs. Six.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling judged that this crazy sixth lady should use her body as some kind of container to contain some kind of powerful ghost.</p>

    <p>The powerful ghost gathered in her body acted like a "central processing unit."</p>

    <p>She can freely mobilize her controlled ghosts for her use.</p>

    <p>"Have you merged with that ghost called the Hair Demon?"</p>

    <p>So very quickly. Wang Ling came to his own conclusion.</p>

    <p>That hairy demon has a very long range.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Remember. Previously, their immortal boat was still an hour away from Sun Island.</p>

    <p>The cockpit was invaded by the ghost's hair. It penetrated directly and took control of the pilot.</p>

    <p>Calculate based on that range.</p>

    <p>Even if Mrs. Six doesn't go out, she can still control everything at home through the ghosts in her body...</p>

    <p>And the best proof.</p>

    <p>It was the death of "Zhang Sacrifice" that caused one of Jiugong Xinghui's hairs to quickly wither and then fall off...</p>

    <p>Because that hair was originally tied to Zhang Sacrifice.</p>

    <p>As long as any ghost dies.</p>

    <p>Madam Six's hair will fall out like this.</p>

    <p>So now. Wang Ling suddenly had a bold idea.</p>

    <p>What would happen if he reached out directly through the mirror in front of Mrs. Six and pulled her out bald...?</p>
