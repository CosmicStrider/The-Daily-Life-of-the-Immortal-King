  <h1>Chapter 2068 Visiting a friend I have never met</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The restricted navigation zone in the Daxiling Sea is recognized by all major cultivating countries in the world as high seas.</p>

    <p>Because the restricted area for navigation is dangerous and mysterious, it is a place that no one has jurisdiction over.</p>

    <p>If you were in trouble in the restricted area, no outsiders would come to rescue you. Therefore, for a certain period of time, the restricted area also became a secret gathering place for some criminal gangs.</p>

    <p>Those criminal gangs think that as long as they own a ship in this restricted navigation area, they have a perfect haven.</p>

    <p>However, the fact is that there are countless cases of people disappearing after entering this restricted area over the years...</p>

    <p>Although Mixiu Country will not provide international rescue to cultivators seeking death trapped in the Hainan Airlines restricted area, it will still conduct close satellite surveillance of this mysterious marine restricted area.</p>

    <p>Going back to the most recent date, there was a person who had just come into contact with Wang Ling a while ago. He disappeared into this restricted area of navigation...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>St. Peter's Basilica in the city of Glio. The Arch Pope calmly lectured from above, repeating his daily work without any flaws.</p>

    <p>Ever since Levis was transformed into the appearance of the Arch Pope by Wang Ying's "Shadow Film Assimilation Technique" last time, he has been working hard to play the role of the Arch Pope every day.</p>

    <p>Levis was originally obsessed with supreme power. In the entire Glio City, his position as the Arch Pope can be said to be extremely powerful. The most important thing is that the Arch Pope of Glio City is also the uncle of the Yuan Zun of Mixiu Country..</p>

    <p>Of course, there are very few people who know this level of identity. And even if they know, they try to keep silent as much as possible. They will not reveal even a word. Otherwise, it is very easy to be liquidated by the Yuan Zun of the Cultivation Country.</p>

    <p>In the past, he was obsessed with power. But after he truly gained power, he suddenly found that everything was so empty.</p>

    <p>In general, as the Arch Pope, there is definitely no shortage of resources for cultivation. Just say hello and you can have whatever you want.</p>

    <p>But for Levi, the only uncomfortable point is that as a clergy actor, he can't be close to women...</p>

    <p>You must know that in the past, he was the suave president of the Chilan Club in Glio City.</p>

    <p>So during the initial period, Levi was extremely uncomfortable because he was pretending to be someone else every day... But now, he found that he seemed to be gradually getting into the role, and he was beginning to get used to the life of being a Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>He recited the holy law in the church every day. He only felt that his six sense organs were pure and refreshing. Even his state of mind was much more stable than before. He also vaguely had the posture to break through to the next level.</p>

    <p>Of course. In addition to the daily work of the church, as Wang Ying's strongest informant in Glio City for the Office of Strategic Deception, Levis did not forget to share his daily work status and some specific information with the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Originally everything was going well, but until a few days ago, he heard a piece of news.</p>

    <p>Half a month ago, Glio City experienced a major reshuffle. It was a show that Mixiu Country's Yuan Zun staged together with the wealthy aristocrat Mrs. Lawen, who was a powerful influence in the entertainment industry, in order to check and balance the forces of all parties. play.</p>

    <p>At that time, the army force to which the legendary general Maiko Assi belonged, the Heavenly Dao Alliance, the Tengu and other small forces had all undergone reshuffling and checks and balances.</p>

    <p>But just a few days ago, Levi's received news that the legendary general Maiko Assi, who was said to have entered the realm of Venerated Immortal, stepped into the restricted area of navigation.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that three full days have passed. Maiko Assi's spiritual power signal has disappeared. It seems that the whole person has been swallowed up by that world.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi has become a lot more honest since he was beaten last time. For Mixiu Country, although this legendary general was once very arrogant and arrogant, for Xiu Zhen Country, he is an indispensable fighting force.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Yuan Zun of Mixiu Country was also particularly concerned about the news of Maiko Assi's disappearance.</p>

    <p>After the satellite magic weapon failed to detect the spiritual power signal of Maiko Assi for several days in a row, Levis finally couldn't bear it anymore and relayed the matter to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>This is an international long distance call from a few days ago.</p>

    <p>Levis was very cautious. He took off the clothes of the Arch Pope and wore casual clothes. He used a phone booth on the street in Glio to communicate with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"This is the situation. True Lord."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I already know the situation."</p>

    <p>"The Yuan Zun over at Mixiu Country can't come forward in person. So I want to find the master privately and go to the forbidden sea area to find the whereabouts of Maiko Assi."</p>

    <p>"Looking for masters privately?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei instantly understood the meaning.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. This doesn't follow the process.</p>

    <p>He also knew about the restricted area for navigation. Moreover, he had already visited the Atlantic Ocean when he was not the official head of the Office of Strategic Deception and was a famous "death-seeking senior" in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why I come out of it alive every time, but there are always people who disappear inexplicably in this restricted area of the sea.</p>

    <p>This made Lord Diulei think that it might be a hype by some people with ulterior motives.</p>

    <p>But now I didn't expect that even Mixiu Country's famous legendary general Maiko Assi has disappeared into the sea restricted area...</p>

    <p>This immediately made Lord Diulei feel a little interested.</p>

    <p>But obviously, Levi's said that they wanted to find experts privately. But it is impossible for Lord Diulei to really send someone from the Office of Strategic Deception there, let alone go there himself. After all, Levi's true identity is the Yuan from Huaxiu Alliance. Your Excellency is currently completely unaware. If the contact is too deep, there may be other hidden risks.</p>

    <p>"Let's do it. Brother Li, I will recommend someone. But this person has nothing to do with my Office of Strategic Deception. You should know the specific reason."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Levi nodded immediately.</p>

    <p>"Besides, if we successfully find Maiko Assi, what will be the benefits?"</p>

    <p>"On this point, I already tested my nephew before I spoke to Zhenjun. My nephew said that Zhenjun can put forward a condition that I can achieve."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I want a 0.001nm Talisman lithography machine. If you don't have one, a 0.01nm one will do."</p>

    <p>"I knew that Zhenjun would say this...so I took this as a condition from the beginning."</p>

    <p>"What did your nephew say?"</p>

    <p>"He said he would give Maiko Assi a great burial at sea."</p>

    <p>"Hey...this is completely insincere."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed and said with a wry smile: "Well then. I happen to have a job here, and it happened to be a little hindered. It might be a lot more convenient if I have your nephew."</p>

    <p>"So. What does Zhenjun want?"</p>

    <p>"A pass to assist in the investigation of the Mishu Alliance Interstellar Department. I want to collect some information about meteorites."</p>

    <p>"This should be easier to handle than the previous conditions. I think there will be no problem in negotiating."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The call was interrupted. Lord Diulei rubbed his eyebrows. He had many other tasks to handle at the moment.</p>

    <p>In addition to helping Wang Ling investigate all meteorite matters. Now he also wants to go to the beach.</p>

    <p>This is also what Wang Ling means.</p>

    <p>In fact, he would go even without Wang Ling's instructions.</p>

    <p>He is going to visit a friend he has never met. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>The sea water is cold. But sometimes it is not as cold as the human heart.</p>

    <p>It is ever-changing. Just standing on the shore can make people see all the emotions.</p>

    <p>It's real. It's not that complicated. The endless sea is full of traces surrounded by sunlight.</p>

    <p>It's deep. But it doesn't seem so bottomless.</p>

    <p>Maybe. This is why that friend likes the sea.</p>

    <p>At this time, joy, anger, sorrow, and joy may no longer be important.</p>

    <p>Because everything in front of him is the most beautiful scenery in the world...</p>

    <p>A friend I have never met. I wish you endless warmth in your future.</p>
