  <h1>Chapter 1792 What the beauty of the face cannot cover is the brilliance of the soul</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at the face of the legendary Mixiu Country general in the void. Everyone at Number 60 High School seemed to recall the black-and-white photo of this man printed in the history book from Lao Gudong's course on the history of cultivation.</p>

    <p>"This is Maiko Assi? It does look similar to the photo... but why does it feel different? It seems to have become much younger." Li Youyue covered her mouth and said in surprise.</p>

    <p>Although there was beauty-preserving technology in that era, it did not have the same beauty technology as it does now. The black-and-white photo of General Maiko Assi in the history textbook authentically shows the appearance of this general when he was all-powerful.</p>

    <p>But compared to now, Maiko Assi is indeed much younger. It should be that he will practice beauty-preserving techniques or take beauty elixirs in the future.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a legendary general. There is nothing wrong with cultivating and promoting him as an idol. In this era where appearance is justice, having an eternally youthful face seems to be more popular.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone has the same confidence as the Huaxiu Kingdom's Sword Saint, Martial Saint and the other eight generals. With their own grace and unparalleled achievements, their names can make that glorious history remembered by everyone.</p>

    <p>The beauty of the face. What can never be covered is the brilliance of the soul.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't know how long it will take for him to grow old. But if one day he really does grow old. Wang Ling thinks he probably won't use other means to fix his appearance.</p>

    <p>He didn't have much appeal in this regard. In all things, conforming to nature is the eternal truth.</p>

    <p>It's just that not everyone thinks that way.</p>

    <p>The modern world of cultivation is also very different from the past. In an era of changing profit models, even legendary generals like Meiko Assi are unavoidable and have become tools to consolidate social and financial status.</p>

    <p>It is true that Maiko Assi is a genius. However, if a cultivator has a dirty mind, he will not be able to achieve greatness in the end.</p>

    <p>At this moment, at the moment when Maiko Assi transformed into the Golden Crow. Wang Ling, Wang Muyu noticed at the same time that there were electronic eyes coming from all directions. There were hundreds of them surrounding him.</p>

    <p>These are the electronic eyes arranged by Maiko Assi. He is confident that he can defeat the giant beast from the center of the earth. Therefore, he also plans to record them at the same time as video evidence to promote his future reputation.</p>

    <p>In the sky, the golden light all over his body merged with the sun, as if integrated into one body. The blazing light finally condensed into a golden ripple visible to the naked eye in his palm.</p>

    <p>"Ripples galloping..." Wang Muyu frowned.</p>

    <p>He could feel it. This was a spell that extracted stellar flames. However, Maiko Assi's use of it was immature. Apparently it had just been researched recently.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Maiko Assi is used for display. In fact, it is also a manifestation of showing one's muscles to the world in conjunction with the electronic eye.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Wang Muyu muttered without interest: "It's a far cry from Ripple Racing..."</p>

    <p>The true ripple sprint technique can make the emitted light waves equal to the temperature of the sun's core. However, the current temperature of Maiko Assi is not even one-third of the sun's core temperature.</p>

    <p>Maybe you can flex your muscles here on Earth.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of real masters, it is too childish. It can only be called Little Sun Boxing.</p>

    <p>"Dad, when are you going to show him the real ripple galloping?" At this time, Wang Muyu was sitting on Wang Ling's lap, looking at him with expectant eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Even if it were to be displayed. Wang Ling would not be able to be displayed on Earth.</p>

    <p>He can indeed do this trick of Maiko Assi. And the power is more than hundreds of millions of times more powerful than Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>But the problem is that if this trick is shown on the earth, the spirit of the earth may not be able to withstand it again.</p>

    <p>Now it is not just the spirits of the earth. The other planet spirits in the universe have great opinions on their actions. And many planet spirits have written letters of complaint to the Heavenly Dao Committee.</p>

    <p>The main complaint is not about Wang Ling. It is about Wang Ying...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that this guy Wang Ying has good physical strength.</p>

    <p>Use the Planet thumping technique on Sun Ying'er at eight o'clock every night.</p>

    <p>Almost never fell...</p>

    <p>"You evil beast. Today I will show you how powerful I am."</p>

    <p>At this time, when Maiko Assi finished charging up, the blazing light waves emitted from the void finally turned into a long flame dragon and hit the giant beast from the center of the earth.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>From a distance, the fire dragon shot from the palm of Maiko Assi was a humanoid self-propelled laser cannon. It penetrated the energy wall of the earth's inner beast on the spot.</p>

    <p>"There is hope! As expected of General Maiko Assi!"</p>

    <p>In the base, countless soldiers exclaimed. Maiko Assi's first round of attack successfully penetrated the energy wall, which instantly boosted the confidence of all the soldiers here.</p>

    <p>The giant beast from the center of the earth received a blow after being blocked by the energy wall. It let out a painful roar. It was not killed directly, but the thick leather armor on its body was burning under the orange firelight.</p>

    <p>The poor inner-earth beast stretched out its little claws and tried to extinguish the flames. Then it rolled on the ground again to extinguish the flames.</p>

    <p>"Bad beast. No matter who summoned you, you will definitely die today..." Maiko Assi smiled. There was a bit of arrogance in his relaxed tone. He was about to launch the second round of attack.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that time is almost up. He has his own plan. The purpose of summoning the earth-centered beast is not just to let the earth-centered beast come out and put on a show.</p>

    <p>After all, this earth-centered beast is just a cub. It is normal for it to be unable to withstand the damage from Maiko Assi. If you summon an adult earth-centered beast.</p>

    <p>With Maiko Assi's current fighting strength, he is likely to be beaten badly.</p>

    <p>He secretly used his pupil power. Just when the second cannon condensed by Maiko Assi was about to get close to the giant beast from the center of the earth, he used the reverse summoning technique to teleport the giant beast from the center of the earth back to the inner earth world.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the burnt skin scraps of the giant beast from the center of the earth were used to create a Chilan mark on the ground...</p>

    <p>This is all done in an instant.</p>

    <p>It looked like the giant beast from the center of the earth was directly blown up by Maiko Assi's second cannon and evaporated on the spot.</p>

    <p>After the smoke screen disappeared, the Chilan mark on the ground caught Maiko Assi's eyes for the first time.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>In the void, Maiko Assi stared at the Chilan marks and frowned slightly. He felt that they looked familiar, but he couldn't remember what they were.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he waved and moved the nearest electronic eye to his side. He began to scan the graphics on the ground.</p>

    <p>Soon, an electronic sound came to Maiko Assi's ears.</p>

    <p>"Chilan Society..."</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi remembered.</p>

    <p>This is the mafia organization in the city of Glio.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this giant beast was summoned by this mafia organization... How dare these damn guys!?</p>

    <p>Immediately, he faced the soldiers garrisoned at the base below and said, "The whole army obeys the order!"</p>

    <p>"Join up!"</p>

    <p>The soldiers quickly lined up in a square formation and responded.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi hummed: "Pass my order. Clear out the Chilan Society in Glio City! All members of the Chilan Society will be executed on the spot! No one will be spared!"</p>

    <p>"But General. Execution on the spot... this seems to be against the rules..."</p>

    <p>"What do you know." Maiko Assi said proudly, with an air of righteousness: "Rules are meant to be broken! At this moment, in the name of Maiko Assi, I have made a decision against my ancestors! This is for the sake of humanity! To eliminate the evil!"</p>
