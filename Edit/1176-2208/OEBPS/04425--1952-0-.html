  <h1>Chapter 1952 The 0-level game of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Regarding Teng Luchen's thoughts. Wang Ling's heart is like a mirror. To others, the internal beta test in the spirit world is just an ordinary elite trial.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, the essence of this internal beta is actually a psychological game.</p>

    <p>Faced with a choice for the first time. Wang Ling was lucky enough to get through. If you passively wait for the options to disappear every time, the behavior of directly giving up the choice is actually a negative competition mentality.</p>

    <p>After all, if you fail to make an immediate choice three times in a row, you will be forcibly eliminated.</p>

    <p>With Teng Luchen's suspicious personality, Wang Ling felt that if he acted too negatively, he might be suspected.</p>

    <p>So this time he had to make his own decision.</p>

    <p>Just as the thirty-second timer in the upper right corner was about to end. Wang Ling chose 2. In this case, it is always right to follow the people around and echo. The portrait with surging mana is obviously Teng Luchen's right. Another test of my own.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>This old man is so cunning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling breathed a sigh of relief and sighed in his heart. He has never met such a difficult person.</p>

    <p>But for the present plan, we have to take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually has a lot of trump cards. If it comes to threatening his identity, he can use them one after another to make Teng Luchen retreat.</p>

    <p>But now he feels that he doesn't need to be so anxious to show off his skills. It's still good to play with this little old man.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen has a noble status. Being able to be the commander-in-chief of the Earth Center Project at this age shows that his strength is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling is willing to continue playing with him is because he still has the intention to make him one of his own.</p>

    <p>If Teng Luchen joins, the development after Zhuo Yi will be even more unhindered.</p>

    <p>Of course Wang Ling also knew that he was in danger if he kept playing with him like this. In fact, he was also in danger.</p>

    <p>But there is no other way. He has nothing but many trump cards.</p>

    <p>Wait until the game is ruined and then find a way to end it.</p>

    <p>After the morning meeting, Wang Ling followed the guidance of Senior Brother Haoren Peak with a slightly serious mood. Along with a few scattered disciples, they came to the sect cafeteria. A very dilapidated bamboo house. Several futons were placed there. On the shore.</p>

    <p>Today, Haoren Peak had the usual steamed buns, pickles and a bowl of porridge.</p>

    <p>"Brother, are there no crabs?" Li Changzhe asked weakly. He sincerely thanked the great poverty alleviation strategy of modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Now the whole country of Huaxiu has been lifted out of poverty. Even the worst cultivation sect's morning meal will not only be full of pickles with so little water. Even if it is a script designed in the spirit world... this design is too exaggerated. Got it!</p>

    <p>"My sect master just remembers the bitter and thinks of the sweet. The Tao is the most simple. You have been here for so long and you still don't understand this truth?" Obviously, Li Changzhe's unintentional words offended the senior brother of Haoren Peak.</p>

    <p>The senior brother put his strong arms on his waist and immediately began to reprimand: "If you really can't stay in our Haoren Peak anymore, you can follow the example of the traitor Senior Brother Qi and go down the mountain! Go and join a stronger sect!"</p>

    <p>"Senior brother, don't be angry. He just has such a temper. He just made a faux pas unintentionally. It was not intentional." Zhang Linyan quickly smoothed things over.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was watching a play. In my heart, I felt the reality of this spiritual script. These cultivators are not illusions designed by the system. They are real cultivators. They are also real actors. They are people of flesh and blood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling guesses. These people should have been arranged into the spirit world a long time ago. And everyone performs their own duties and has their own work. Just like the actors who play various NPCs in modern secret rooms.</p>

    <p>Such acting skills can be seen as someone from an orthodox academic background. It is also too real...</p>

    <p>"By the way, senior brother. Do you know why senior brother Qi came down the mountain to betray us?" At this time, Zhang Linyan followed the senior brother's words and continued to ask.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and others know it well. Now we have entered the stage of the main plot.</p>

    <p>The senior brother sat down on the side and took a bite of the steamed bun. He sighed deeply and said, "Why else?</p>

    <p>Of course, it is to stand out in the sect competition three days later. At that time, the twenty-one peaks nearby will compete. The overall strength of our Haoren Peak is at the bottom. "Because there is a team competition. He knows that with the strength of our entire peak With all our combined strength, we can't survive the group stage. So of course we left."</p>

    <p>"Look at how many people we have in Haoren Peak now. Me, the three of you, plus Qiaoer and the headmaster. There are only six people in total..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Listening to Senior Brother's bitter voice, Wang Ling couldn't help but shake his head.</p>

    <p>It's true that Good Man's Peak is too poor. And Wang Ling just observed the entire map of the Number 2 Proving Ground from a God's perspective through King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>It seems that only the Haoren Sect on Haoren Peak is the most primitive sect. It still retains this rather simple ancient cultivation temperament. The other twenty peaks have basically entered modernization!</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling just happened to see Qu Shuling when she switched perspectives. She was wearing a suit and punching in with her work badge on the Wuxiang Peak next door!</p>

    <p>Good guys. They came to the spirit world to eat porridge and pickles...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling directly found a place to work.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent in his heart. This Haoren Sect is indeed too primitive...</p>

    <p>However, after listening to the introduction just now by Senior Brother. Wang Ling, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan also understood the final mission of this trial.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it will be the so-called sect competition in three days.</p>

    <p>In other words, within three days, they must collect as many magic weapons and cultivation resources as possible to increase their combat power.</p>

    <p>At this time, the three Wang Ling looked at each other. Although they didn't exchange anything, their eyes had already shown a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought about it carefully. He felt that the system distribution in the spiritual world should take into account checks and balances.</p>

    <p>After all, this time it was originally a solo mission. The difficulty of the solo mission is bound to increase. Without other companions to discuss with, you have to explore everything by yourself.</p>

    <p>But the situation here at Wang Ling was completely different. As soon as he landed, three people were bound...</p>

    <p>A three-person mission. Then the starting location assigned is bound to be the worst.</p>

    <p>The poor Good Man clan on this dilapidated Good Man Peak... everything looks so hopeless. It seems that there is no chance of winning at all.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling is very calm inside.</p>

    <p>To him, this is just a game.</p>

    <p>And with Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan here, there are still people who will take the blame for themselves.</p>

    <p>It would be very difficult for Wang Ling to really perform the task alone.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I see that everyone has eaten and drank enough. In order to prepare for the sect competition in three days, I think it is still necessary to conduct special training. Next, I will take everyone to the designated trial place." Senior Brother said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>So this is. Trial within trial?</p>

    <p>The senior brother of Haoren Peak said it very easily. But in fact, when they actually arrived at the place of trial, Wang Ling the three of them could not help but feel their hearts skip a beat.</p>

    <p>Because this is a mine that is steaming everywhere. Because it is a volcano, the surrounding environment is extremely humid and sultry. And their trial mission this time is to excavate fire stones in this mine.</p>

    <p>When the mine owner saw them coming, he immediately acted like a boss and smiled arrogantly at the newcomers who had just joined the mine.</p>

    <p>There were several people standing next to him. One of the attendants immediately stood up and said: "Look at the faces of the mine owner and us from now on. When the mine owner comes, he is here to inspect the work. Look at the work badges. Who is in charge except us? You are all in trouble."</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce you. This is the director of our mine engineering department. Call me manager."</p>

    <p>"Hello, manager." Some scattered sounds came from the mine.</p>

    <p>"Let's not be lazy during the day."</p>

    <p>The manager cleared his throat. He chuckled and said, "When you are sleepy and tired, think more about yourselves and your sect. There will be a sect competition in three days. We are the sponsors. Your sect only has loans." This fund is used to participate in the competition. Otherwise, you have no choice but to withdraw. So work hard. But you must fill the hole in this loan as soon as possible. Otherwise, your sect will only become poorer and poorer."</p>
