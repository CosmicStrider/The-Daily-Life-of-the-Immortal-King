  <h1>Chapter 1236 Void Werewolf Killing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is absolutely no better toilet in the world than Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>He is not only the enlightened spirit who has seen the butts of the men in the Wang family. He is also the spirit who controls the toilets all over the world.</p>

    <p>If the fourth-order attunement standard is reached, this range can be expanded further.</p>

    <p>As the chief disciple of Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi naturally knows how powerful Lord Ma is.</p>

    <p>This kind of teleportation control ability can really only be described as "defying the heavens."</p>

    <p>"Thanks to Lord Ma for this."</p>

    <p>Above the True Venerated Immortal Hall. Zhuo Yi heard the explanation from Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>I couldn't help but have the habit of muttering to myself again.</p>

    <p>"Who is Lord Ma?" Sun Yiyuan sat on guest secretary's chair with a curious look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma is an enlightened spirit. Of course Zhuo Yi cannot reveal his identity directly.</p>

    <p>But he didn't want to deceive the Boss Sun in front of him, so he thought of a reasonable explanation: "He is an excellent courier."</p>

    <p>"Then this courier has made a great contribution." Sun Yiyuan also marveled.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed dedicated." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma's dedication is not just something that Zhuo Yi just talks about.</p>

    <p>He heard that Lord Ma was in love recently.</p>

    <p>And the object of his love is the "Ushen Tree" that deeply extracted his nutrients before...</p>

    <p>This should be the first of all the monsters in the Wang family villa to be single.</p>

    <p>And what people never expected is that this single Lord Ma actually does not look young.</p>

    <p>But beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>

    <p>The girl Ushenshu is just like Lord Ma. There is nothing I can do about it.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he is indeed a spirit inspired by Master.</p>

    <p>He was clearly in love, but he still completed his task brilliantly.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, the people from Zhenyuan Immortal couldn't help but marvel at Zhuo Yi's speaking ability.</p>

    <p>The story of a greedy girl begging for fertilizer suddenly became a love story of a dedicated courier.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is indeed a rare talent.</p>

    <p>"How long will the test take?" Boss Sun sat on the guest seat and took a sip of tea.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, he has been observing Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>Because this is another strong man he doesn't know...</p>

    <p>He was glad in his heart that he didn't really do anything just now.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I'm afraid his old face may no longer have a place.</p>

    <p>This Office of Strategic Deception day is terrible.</p>

    <p>There are unknown masters of "sweeping monk" level everywhere. This is so outrageous!</p>

    <p>"Immortal Toya is already conducting experiments. It should be soon. But in the final analysis, our drug laboratory in the Office of Strategic Deception may not be as high-end as those under Mr. Sun's group."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said this and narrowed his eyes slightly with a smile: "Everyone knows that the first level five elixir laboratory in the country was built by Huaguo Shuilian Group. Unfortunately, our Office of Strategic Deception is currently short of funds. And there is such a thing We have many disciples to support. We still can't afford to open this laboratory."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Yiyuan took a sip of water.</p>

    <p>He is not a fool. Of course he can understand the hint in Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>This is no longer a hint. From the perspective of Zhuo Yi, this is almost an explicit statement.</p>

    <p>But Sun Yiyuan did not intend to accept this.</p>

    <p>The construction cost of the fifth-level elixir laboratory is particularly expensive. At least 1 billion immortal gold is required.</p>

    <p>With this money, you can open a heaven-level sect again.</p>

    <p>Any investment must pay attention to returns. He is not a philanthropist.</p>

    <p>He is a businessman. He will not make investments without any reason.</p>

    <p>To Sun Yiyuan's surprise, Zhuo Yi did not continue to stalk him. Instead, he changed the topic back to Keorn.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Keorn. I remember that the SBP Foundation was originally invested and established by the International Cultivator Alliance?"</p>

    <p>"Exactly." Keorn nodded.</p>

    <p>This is a fact that everyone knows. So there is nothing to hide.</p>

    <p>"Let's gossip. How much was the initial investment?"</p>

    <p>"It seems to be 1.5 billion immortal gold. It only counts as operational investment. If you add equipment and venues... the total investment has already exceeded 3 billion."</p>

    <p>"Does the Foundation also have an elixir laboratory?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It's a Level 5 laboratory. This laboratory was built by the Torenos Dancing Company in Mixiu Country."</p>

    <p>"No way? The funds to establish a level 5 laboratory are not low. How can any entrepreneur invest for no reason?" Zhuo Yi showed an expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo, you must believe that there are still people in this world who possess truth, kindness and beauty, and who sincerely contribute to world peace."</p>

    <p>Keorn's words were very sincere. After speaking, he glanced at Sun Yiyuan out of the corner of his eye: "Of course. Not all outstanding entrepreneurs have this awareness..."</p>

    <p>When Mr. Boss Sun heard this, his hand holding the tea began to tremble.</p>

    <p>He regrets it very much now.</p>

    <p>He shouldn't have chosen to come to the Office of Strategic Deception in the first place...</p>

    <p>Isn't this obvious moral blackmail?</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiAlthough he never asked him to help the Office of Strategic Deception establish a laboratory from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>But this time the "gossip" with Keorn came to an end. Keorn's words were heartbreaking.</p>

    <p>It's the kind of "heart-breaking" that kills people!</p>

    <p>As an excellent entrepreneur, Sun Yiyuan really felt that his conscience seemed to be shaken.</p>

    <p>At this point, seeing Sun Yiyuan's expression, Zhuo Yi knew that things in the Office of Strategic Deception level 5 laboratory were basically stable.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun doesn't say anything. I'm afraid he has fallen into a deep "moral whirlpool" in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although his methods are a bit despicable, sometimes they are despicable and shameful, but they are useful!</p>

    <p>Things have progressed to this point. Zhuo Yi naturally has no chance of stopping.</p>

    <p>In the end, he still stared at Sun Yiyuan and added the final blow: "I know. Mr. Sun is an excellent entrepreneur. He must have the same corporate conscience as Torenos Pill Making Company."</p>

    <p>"This... this is natural..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan took a deep breath. He gritted his teeth and stared at Zhuo Yi: "Don't worry, Mr. Zhuo. It's about the Office of Strategic Deception level 5 laboratory. When this incident comes to an end, I, Huaguo Shuilian Group, Carry out investment and construction."</p>

    <p>"This. How can this be so embarrassing?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Hearing this, he stood up immediately: "How can I, the Office of Strategic Deception, accept such a great gift from Mr. Sun? But then again, this is definitely Mr. Sun's choice, right? Otherwise, what if? Word spread that it was my Office of Strategic Deception who was coercing us. We cannot afford to lose this reputation."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun tried his best to keep a smile: "It's voluntary... all this is out of my conscience as an entrepreneur..."</p>

    <p>So. In this pleasant conversation about "entrepreneurial conscience."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi seemed to hear the sound of teeth being gritted.</p>

    <p>But he can tell.</p>

    <p>This should be. Not an illusion...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The time is already 2:12 am on Thursday, November 26th.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not fall asleep.</p>

    <p>After completing his homework, he also secretly assisted in investigating matters related to the foundation.</p>

    <p>According to the clues left by Warden Liang.</p>

    <p>There are seven main emissaries behind the foundation.</p>

    <p>The book of Sage Immortal. Lists the information of these seven people in detail. It appears in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is relevant information extracted from Warden Liang's soul memory.</p>

    <p>And his soul has been protected by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Position 1: Moon. I don't know the gender but I hate a gentle person.</p>

    <p>Position 2: Star. Has more intelligence capabilities than others. Claims to have prophetic abilities.</p>

    <p>Position 3: The Sun. Always exudes a sense of justice like a big brother.</p>

    <p>Position 4: Judgment. The host of the meeting. His voice is shrill and funny. I don't know whether he is a man or a woman.</p>

    <p>Position 5: Chariot. His acting style is as violent as his code name.</p>

    <p>Position 6: Destiny. A man of few words. But he can always give hints at critical moments.</p>

    <p>Position 7: The Fool. Always leaves meetings midway and misses meetings. Very mysterious.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After reading Wang Ling, I feel like I am playing Werewolf...</p>

    <p>So among these seven people, who is the undercover agent of Void, and how many wolves are there?</p>
