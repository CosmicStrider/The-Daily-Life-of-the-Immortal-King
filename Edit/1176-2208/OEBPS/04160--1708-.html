  <h1>Chapter 1708 Killing Jin Deng</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"We have tried our best..." About half an hour later, immortal Toya, Cailian Zhenren, and monk Jin Deng walked out of the Office of Strategic Deception's sterile operating room with a regretful look on their faces, and immortal Toya took off his own mask and gloves while saying, looking at Zhang Zhui, a little bit bewildered.</p>

    <p>What people fear most is hearing doctors say such words. Zhang Zhui lowered his head and his body trembled slightly. He was too confident. Even if Wang Ming proposed that plan, he, a senior, should have stopped him. He should not be so arbitrary.</p>

    <p>Just when tears were about to ooze from the corners of his eyes, Immortal Toya added another sentence: "The soul has been hurt. I can only find Ling Zhenren later to find a solution."</p>

    <p>"Not dead?" Zhang Zhui immediately stopped crying and raised his head suddenly.</p>

    <p>"With me here, of course it's impossible to let senior Li Xian die like that." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"Then please finish your sentence in one go the next time you speak..."</p>

    <p>"It's my fault." Immortal Toya smiled bitterly: "Miss Zhai Yin is not hindered, she took a hibernation pill for her to extended her rest, if she woke up and knew what had happened to Mr. Ming, she would have collapsed."</p>

    <p>"That's all we have to do." Zhang Zhui nodded. At the same time, he couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had never been so embarrassed. The last time he cried was an eternity ago.</p>

    <p>And the last time I cried, it was because I was beaten by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>But any sadness now is of no use. The key lies in how to remedy it. The current situation is worse than imagined. Li Xian was seriously injured. Wang Ming was directly manipulated.</p>

    <p>Since the founding of the Office of Strategic Deception. Nothing seems worse than the situation at hand.</p>

    <p>The man in the khaki trench coat injured Li Xian to this extent with just two snaps of his fingers. It can be said that this was far beyond Zhang Zhui's expectation.</p>

    <p>And based on the information provided by Zhang Zhui so far, Jin Deng generally has his own guess about the whole thing.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you have already been to Wanlong Mountain. It is the Dragon Cemetery from the Eternal Period. There are many dragon bones buried there." Monk Jin Deng said: "Although it is not clear what method they used. But from Brother Zi Judging from what my brother said, the man wearing a khaki trench coat may be a dragonborn who has inherited the power of an eternal dragon."</p>

    <p>"But the dragon clan is clearly extinct..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui felt extremely unbelievable when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Even to many immortals like Zhang Zhui, the Dragon Clan is an absolute legend...</p>

    <p>It was a powerful cosmic race that once ruled an era together with the Old Dominator. It also perished before the Old Dominator.</p>

    <p>"If we can piece together the complete dragon bones, there may be a way to condense the dragon soul from the remaining dragon breath with supreme magic power, and then use genetic technology to create these human dragon descendants." Jin Deng said with a frown.</p>

    <p>He knew that the most troublesome thing now was not just this. Although Zhang Zhui only encountered one of the dragonborns, it was obvious that this incident had been planned for a long time. The number of dragonborns behind him was probably far more than that.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most difficult problem is that the opponent has a chaos concentration of more than 60% and has a powerful serial level chaos device...</p>

    <p>It is not difficult for the monk to guess that these powerful dragon-born chaos weapons are probably made by refining dragon bones. They are equivalent to custom-made magic weapons formed after putting the natal magic weapon into chaos for refining. This is compared with the strength of the dragon-born chaos weapon that is usually produced from chaos. The magic weapon produced is much stronger.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Monk Jin Deng couldn't help but feel a little scared. The only thing he was lucky about was that he had helped Sun Rong upgrade Aohai to nine cores in advance...</p>

    <p>With the addition of the nine-core Aohai, even if these dragonborn find trouble, Sun Rong can now protect herself.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jin Deng made some calculations with his fingers. The expression on his face was more serious than ever before: "The situation is going to change."</p>

    <p>He only said four words. Everyone present fell silent for a moment. They felt an unprecedented sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>"This matter must be reported to Ling Zhenren and the True Lord as soon as possible. Everyone must beware of the Dragonborn's sneak attack." These words dispersed in the void along with Monk Jin Deng's figure that turned into the breeze and dissipated.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't say much, everyone knew that there would be a tough battle ahead.</p>

    <p>Infinite Buddhist Courtyard.</p>

    <p>This is the "supreme world" opened up by the first generation of Buddhist sages. Now this piece of direct transmission to the hands of monk Jin Deng, at this time he is sitting on a huge golden lotus platform, endless seven-colored Buddha light through the top of the auspicious clouds covering the earth, RuiLong ten thousand lines of light.</p>

    <p>Every scene here is full of the solemn power of Buddhism. There is an indescribable feeling of astonishment. It is a golden statue of Sakyamuni that reaches a height of 1,000 feet and is one of the most majestic symbols of the court of the Infinite Buddha.</p>

    <p>From the earliest generation of the sage inheritance of Buddhism to this point, the Infinite Buddhist Courtyard embodies the divine power of dozens of eminent monks who stacked up profound Buddhist teachings.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng originally did not want to disturb this Buddhist pure land. However, the emergency situation forced him to enter here to take precautions.</p>

    <p>He had already calculated that he had been targeted by the Dragonborn, so he came here very early to prepare for the battle.</p>

    <p>But the situation before him was beyond Monk Jin Deng's expectation, because there were actually two Dragonborns who came here.</p>

    <p>When the seven-colored auspicious clouds in the sky were rushed out of a black hole by a powerful dragon's breath that could be called overwhelming, he took a deep breath and knew that the battle was about to begin.</p>

    <p>It hasn't been a long time since he came to the Infinite Buddha Courtyard. These two dragonborns can actually penetrate layers of void and directly pass into other people's supreme world without fear. This kind of combat power is really terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Yan?. Be careful. This monk is not a simple person."</p>

    <p>Jingze was still wearing the windbreaker with a black umbrella on his back. He held Yan?'s hand and said. From a distance, the two looked like a father and daughter. They had the cutest height difference.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng opened his eyes. To him, the Dragon Clan was just a legendary existence.</p>

    <p>Even he felt this kind of dragon power for the first time, so he didn't dare to slack off.</p>

    <p>After the two dragonborn landed in the Infinite Buddha Courtyard, they did nothing. They just held hands and said something. But Jin Deng had already sensed the huge danger between them.</p>

    <p>He could even see the dragon's image behind the two people.</p>

    <p>It was a giant dragon that was tens of thousands of feet long and extremely huge. It was orange-yellow in color and glowing with lightning. There was also a slightly smaller dragon that spit out lava. Its whole body was red and twisted in the air like the Great Wall. Yanlong.</p>

    <p>The intersection of two dragons. Under the intertwining of electric light and fire, there is a powerful momentum that dominates the world and looks down on the world.</p>

    <p>"You are the one. The monk who likes hot pot."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Yan? The soft and cute voice contrasts sharply with the powerful Dharma behind him, creating a strong sense of contrast!</p>

    <p>She stared at Jin Deng. After stuffing all the cones in her hand into her mouth, her eyes instantly filled with murderous intent: "So, are you ready to die?"</p>

    <p>The next moment!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>She directly broke away from Jingze's hand and jumped out in one step. The speed was incredibly fast. Her agile body dragged a long line of fire and attacked from a distance.</p>

    <p>Without the slightest hesitation, his arm transformed into a huge dragon claw the moment he was close to the Jin Deng, and plowed towards the heart of the Jin Deng!</p>
