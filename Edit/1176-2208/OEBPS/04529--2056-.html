  <h1>Chapter 2056 Dao Ancestor Wang's layout purpose</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If you can't beat him, then join. This is the unchangeable law of all things. However, as the Thunder Eater from the same sect as Master Gray Mist, it is one of the most top-notch divine beasts under Dao Ancestor Wang. The Thunder Eater gives in so quickly. It's still beyond what Wang Ling thought.</p>

    <p>After all, at the beginning, this stupid prairie dog struggled for a long time in a self-righteous manner. It was only recently that he finally figured it out and released himself from the autistic petrified state...</p>

    <p>The cowardly attitude of the Thunder-devouring Beast at this moment formed a sharp contrast between the two.</p>

    <p>That's fine too.</p>

    <p>It seems to Wang Ling that at least an unnecessary war can be avoided. But for him, avoiding war as much as possible is the best way to protect the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>This time I came back to someone else's house. And strictly speaking, the nature of the Sun family's ancestral land is actually the tomb of the ancestor of mankind. Good guy, he came to the door and dug up the other person's ancestral tomb. No matter how you put it, this doesn't seem to be good...</p>

    <p>The ancestral land of the Sun family has been really demolished. Wang Ling even doesn't know how to compensate. Obviously, I'm afraid I can't express my apology with just repairs and magic weapons...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling removed his spiritual pressure. He no longer deliberately oppressed the Thunder-Eating Beast, and used a look to signal Lord Gray Mist to ask.</p>

    <p>It's not too stupid. You get it right away.</p>

    <p>I saw Mr. Gray Mist holding his little paws with a look of disdain. It shook its legs and looked at the Thunder Eater in front of it. It said at the same time: "Old Lei, do you think anyone can be a mount for Ling Zhenren? Get in line. Okay. Speaking of which, why are you here in the Sun family's ancestral land? Aren't you locked on the Tribulation Transcendence planet?"</p>

    <p>The Thunder Eater held its head. The expression on its face was also slightly helpless: "I had been practicing hard on the Tribulation Transcendence star. The last impression in my mind was when Master Dao Ancestor found me. He forced me to enter hibernation. Then wait. When you're awakened. That's now."</p>

    <p>"In other words, you didn't even know when you entered the Sun family's ancestral land? You stayed in hibernation until I just poked you in the butt?"</p>

    <p>The Thunder Eater nodded. Its round bear head looked innocent. Wang Ling could feel that its breath was stable and its spiritual power was stable. What it said still had a certain degree of credibility. It proved that it was not lying.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling is still a little confused. What is the purpose of Dao Ancestor Wang sending the thunder-devouring beast to the Sun family's ancestral land?</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Thunder Eater hibernated between the Zhenshan Knight Tomb and the fifth map. It was equivalent to being buried in the soil. It directly continued an eternity of hibernation. Strictly speaking, it is very similar to Sun Ru's situation. But the time span is longer than that of Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>Faced with the situation in front of it, the Thunder Eater was also confused. It looked at Wang Ling. The tangled face was obviously at a loss.</p>

    <p>After a long while, its round eyes stared at the groundhog in front of it. Its expression twitched slightly: "Your contract with Dao Ancestor has been..."</p>

    <p>"Ahem. I didn't take the initiative to break the contract. Because I died once, the contract was automatically terminated. So now I have a new owner." As he said that, Mr. Gray Mist narrowed his eyes and asked him: "That's right. You. It seems you are no longer bound by the contract."</p>

    <p>"It seems that Dao Ancestor solved it for me. I remember he said to me before I fell asleep. If I meet the first person who can suppress my strength after I wake up, I can consider him as my new master."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling is completely gone now.</p>

    <p>He found Dao Ancestor Wang's operations increasingly confusing.</p>

    <p>What's all this...</p>

    <p>The Reality Supreme wrapped Corpse Map. It made him know many things about the Eternal One. Later, it made him pay attention to the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube... Now he even arranged a mount for himself...</p>

    <p>Did you come here specifically to give yourself equipment?</p>

    <p>This is completely unnecessary.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that he would not be able to use the equipment and mounts given by Dao Ancestor Wang if he really had to use them. Even if he had to use them, it would be an extraordinary thing if he randomly sacrificed a magic weapon in his King's Pants.</p>

    <p>The serial level reaches level five. A creation-level chaos device.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has it! Although the quantity is not much.</p>

    <p>But one is better than the other.</p>

    <p>It's just that this thing is very destructive and too troublesome to operate. Wang Ling doesn't bother to use it. Anyway, it is extremely destructive. It would be more straightforward for him to do it himself.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling has its own considerations every time it takes action. Because no matter how you do it, you will later animate various famous scenes. The funding will be a problem...</p>

    <p>If you use magic, it will inevitably cause huge terrain damage. It is actually very difficult to paint the terrain damage. If the painting is rough, the audience will definitely be dissatisfied. But if the painting is surprising, the funds will explode instantly.</p>

    <p>Of course. Considering the painting effect, it is also possible to do it yourself. However, it is actually a big problem to do it. For example, continuous fighting in two-dimensional animation generally requires a martial arts instructor, because the director himself does not understand martial arts. Only by understanding the principles of martial arts can we complete storyboarding and guide subsequent painting.</p>

    <p>Even if it's finished in the end, the cost of making this series of fights coherent is immeasurable.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling does not have to consider saving costs for animation. Because the biggest problem is that the total amount of funds is indeed not as much as everyone imagined...</p>

    <p>There is no other way. For the current plan, we have to take one step at a time. If it really doesn't work, Wang Ling plans to notify the original work and the producer to have a fight. This will at least double the funding!</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling realized that Dao Ancestor Wang's various actions might be to intentionally deliver equipment to himself, he seemed to have figured out a lot of things in an instant...</p>

    <p>He did not speak. Instead, he continued to use his eyes to signal the gray fog to continue digging the tunnel.</p>

    <p>When the thousands of thunder pools connected to the fifth map of the Sun family's ancestral land were opened, Wang Ling seemed to suddenly understand Dao Ancestor Wang's purpose of placing the Thunder Devouring Beast here.</p>

    <p>He looked at the Thunder Eater and motioned for it to go out.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the snow-white and heavy body just stepped out of the tunnel, the thunder that was constantly surging and flashing in the void of thousands of thunder pools on the fifth map in front made an astonishing thunderclap sound. Countless rolling thunder fell from the sky in an instant. Cover down. Their goals are clear. They are like chains of divine punishment heading straight towards the Thunder Beast.</p>

    <p>Such a scene did not make the Thunder Eater react much. After all, compared to the thunder on the Tribulation Transcendence planet, all these in the thousands of thunder pools are completely insignificant compared to the comparison on the Tribulation Transcendence planet.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>When the thunder calamity accurately struck the Thunder Devouring Beast, the clumsy white body remained completely motionless. Not only was it not injured by the thunder calamity, but because of the thunder bath, even the hair on its body instantly became shiny and sparkling.</p>

    <p>Thunder is deadly to others. Hitting it is like receiving a precise supply of nutrient solution.</p>

    <p>"That's true." At this time, Wang Ling muttered.</p>

    <p>"What is Ling Zhenren talking about?"</p>

    <p>"It's Dao Ancestor Wang." Wang Ying knew what Wang Ling was thinking. He chuckled: "Now it seems that this Dao Ancestor Wang is a bit underestimating the Lord. Not to mention the constant delivery of these useless equipment and mounts. It seems. He also laid out the road ahead clearly."</p>

    <p>"Master of Shadows means..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. That's the literal meaning."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying replied: "He arranged the Thunder-Eating Beast on the interlayer between the fifth map and the Zhenshan Knight's Tomb. He calculated our path through this place accurately so that the Thunder-Eating Beast could serve as a lightning rod for us."</p>

    <p>"There is such a thing..." Immortal Toya heard this. His face was full of astonishment.</p>
