  <h1>Chapter 2017 The second way to sneak into the earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Dozens of chaos missiles. Wang Ling solidified them with a wave of his hand. Then they were swallowed up by the golden vortex formed in the void and returned to nothingness.</p>

    <p>He simultaneously opened King's Eyes and brought all these Chaos Missiles into the King's Eyes world. This happened to help Wang Ling's ongoing Cosmic Embryo experiment in King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that the fetus is still in the stage of absorbing nutrients. Therefore, it needs to be fed in large quantities. And these chaos missiles are the best feed.</p>

    <p>It is true that Wang Ling can directly infuse spiritual power. But the durability of Cosmic Embryo Wang Ling is currently unknown. If this goes too far, it would not be good to directly destroy Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the sound of the underworld that Mingyue Ye heard in his ears was not an illusion. In fact, it was a special sound wave emitted by Cosmic Embryo swallowing up those chaos missiles in the world of King's Eyes. It was like gurgling water... which made him mistakenly believe that It's Huangquan.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually did not intend to kill Ming Yue Ye directly. But Ming Yue Ye's panic at this time was obviously too much to contain.</p>

    <p>When he was transported to the earth using meteorites with the prehistoric young master Bai Zijing, his old master Bai Zhe once warned him that there is only one person on the earth today who cannot be provoked. As long as he does not mess with that person and those around him As long as people... develop steadily, it will be good.</p>

    <p>Today, Mingyue Ye naturally still remembers these words. But when Bai Zhe told him, that person had a real name.</p>

    <p>However, when he landed on the earth on a bright moonlit night, he completely forgot that person's name.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Mingyue Ye found that she could not clearly see the face of the person in front of her, she became even more panicked.</p>

    <p>It turns out that person is the mysterious master of Lord Diulei. The real helmsman behind the Office of Strategic Deception. He is also the world's number one cultivator on earth...</p>

    <p>In an instant, Mingyue Yeming understood everything.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he had a lot of thoughts in his mind. Because the man in front of him actually had the ability to erase all information about himself from his mind the moment he landed on the earth.</p>

    <p>This proves that the other party knew about his existence from the beginning...</p>

    <p>This made Mingyue Ye suddenly break into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He couldn't stay any longer. He tapped the ground with the wand in his hand. In an instant, a glass mist spread out. The ground trembled slightly in the entire space. Several ancient ferocious beasts the size of mountains landed here.</p>

    <p>There was a thunder snake that was as long as a mountain range, a toad that was a hundred feet tall, and a slug that was covered in mucus.</p>

    <p>They are transformed from glazed mist. It is an ability that is very similar to Wang Ling's real clone. Normal attacks cannot hit these illusions. However, these illusions have the amazing ability to distort reality.</p>

    <p>Thunder snake, toad and slug. The three are regarded as the most ferocious and violent existence among the mythical beasts. Therefore, they are known as the three heroes of ancient ferocious beasts.</p>

    <p>This was Mingyue Ye's trump card to save his life. I didn't expect that it would come in handy less than a week after being on earth.</p>

    <p>However, what Mingyue Ye never expected was that the three ancient ferocious beasts summoned from real fantasies seemed to have no effect at all on the terrifying man in front of him.</p>

    <p>He still maintained a calm and elegant posture. He put his trouser pockets in and moved forward. With every step he took, one of the three huge beasts would be decomposed.</p>

    <p>"How is that possible?" Mingyue Ye was horrified.</p>

    <p>He had no idea that the life-saving illusion he had tried so hard to use would be so easily broken.</p>

    <p>This is the inherent power of King's Eyes of Wang Ling to remove the false and preserve the true. Therefore, Wang Ling has almost a natural restraint effect on various illusions.</p>

    <p>No matter how realistic the illusion is, it is useless to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So when I saw Mingyue Ye thinking that she had successfully used a life-saving method and planned to escape, Wang Ling laughed in her heart.</p>

    <p>It was a sneer like staring at an ant jumping around in front of one's eyes.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that since Mingyue Ye was personally sent to Earth by Bai Zhe, his business capabilities should be stronger than those of the enemies he had encountered in the past.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this person's ability is so unsightly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling opened his five fingers. Aimed at the sky and pinched the air.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye's whole body was restrained by an invisible force. He could clearly feel that a big hand was tightly restraining his body like a cage.</p>

    <p>Can't resist...</p>

    <p>The fear of death has struck. Mingyue Ye found that she couldn't breathe at all.</p>

    <p>Then he felt that his body was being melted by a spiritual energy. He had the illusion that he was transforming into light.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling did not use that much force. At the moment when he pinched Mingyue Ye, he only used less than 5 cores of palm force...</p>

    <p>With the power of 1 core, it can easily destroy the planet and kill anyone in the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>With Mingyue Ye's strength, he felt that 5 cores should be able to sustain it.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, his palm had just been wrapped up. In front of the huge spiritual energy, Mingyue Ye actually turned into gas.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his entire aura disappeared.</p>

    <p>"The breath. Gone."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jingke's voice came: "But he. Should be. Not dead."</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>As the person who protects Bai Zijing and comes to earth to escort him all the way, Bai Zhe should have many ways to save his life for Mingyue Ye.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling can also predict how the opponent will escape.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling crushed Mingyue Ye's body. Its main purpose was twofold.</p>

    <p>One is to make Mingyue Ye think that he has indeed killed him.</p>

    <p>Secondly, it also made Mingyueye restrain his actions after being on the earth. At least he would not try to devour those so-called strong men in broad daylight...</p>

    <p>"The magic wand in his hand is not simple." At this time, Wang Ying also laughed. He had been observing secretly and saw the clues like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Without her physical body, Mingyue Ye wanted to save her own life, but at the same time, she wanted to prevent her still alive aura from being exposed.</p>

    <p>There is only one way left.</p>

    <p>That is the spirit that becomes the wand.</p>

    <p>Of course, ordinary magic weapons are definitely not able to do this.</p>

    <p>And the magic wand in Mingyue Ye's hand was probably carefully selected and crafted by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Can you use the body of the weapon spirit to get a new life...</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling lowered his head and thought.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt that he had discovered a blind spot that he had never cared about before.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. thought of. What?" Jingke asked.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head and remained silent.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have any evidence.</p>

    <p>Now it's just a guess he made on a whim.</p>

    <p>From the incident of Mingyue Ye turning into a weapon spirit, Wang Ling suddenly thought of the possibility of transporting outsiders to the earth without going through meteorites.</p>

    <p>And compared to meteorite transportation, this method is more secretive.</p>

    <p>That is to reincarnate those alien forces and even the arranged Eternal Ones.</p>

    <p>Implanted directly into the bodies of some cultivators on earth in the form of souls...</p>
