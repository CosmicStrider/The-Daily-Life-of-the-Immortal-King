  <h1>Chapter 1407 The light of grass</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's really good."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the unprecedented grand scene of the Sword King Realm. He couldn't help but murmured.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine that this man would actually speak for a newly born little sword spirit.</p>

    <p>"So. The sword master wants to give him to Ah Nuan?" Jingke asked.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth. It's not that Wang Ling doesn't have this idea.</p>

    <p>Little Sword Spirit is a potential stock. If he is properly cultivated, he will definitely be a talent that can be developed.</p>

    <p>And Ah Nuan has just been born. There are still a few years before he can go to school. Although the little sword spirit is a blank slate, it should take a few years to train him if he has enough potential and talent.</p>

    <p>This is just a conservative estimate of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Judging from Leng Ming's comprehensive qualifications, it actually doesn't take a few years at all. In other words... it doesn't take a year at all. Maybe in a few months, he can learn all the knowledge of the human world before Ah Nuan went to college and train him. Become an excellent fighting sword spirit.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, be prepared and be prepared.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming is his favorite. Currently it is a blank piece of paper. You can keep it as a "spare tire" and cultivate it slowly.</p>

    <p>At the Sword Conference. Sun Rong can still find another one based on your own ideas.</p>

    <p>What if Leng Ming's talent is only focused on combat and he doesn't study well?</p>

    <p>Therefore. It is better to find a spirit sword who can learn and loves to learn.</p>

    <p>No one stipulates that a person can only own one spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>When people walk in the rivers and lakes, there are too many swords to weigh them down.</p>

    <p>Bind multiple spirit swords at the same time. It's not illegal!</p>

    <p>So after making up his mind, Wang Ling stared at Jingke and said, "Take him in."</p>

    <p>Jingke: "Me?"</p>

    <p>"You don't have any disciples yet?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Jingke. The voice transmission asked.</p>

    <p>Jingke: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, he had never thought about accepting a disciple.</p>

    <p>But since this is Wang Ling's intention.</p>

    <p>As a sword spirit, he will certainly comply with his master's wishes.</p>

    <p>Regarding combat, he was very confident that he would teach Leng Ming well.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to study, I'm afraid it won't be that good...</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Jingke himself has not studied much.</p>

    <p>I have never taken any formal classes.</p>

    <p>The things I have mastered are usually learned by reading Wang Ling on the side while doing homework.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling If I can give 100 points by giving my best.</p>

    <p>He can probably only score 90 points?</p>

    <p>The gap is still huge.</p>

    <p>"That's enough." Wang Ling looked at Jingke.</p>

    <p>He knew exactly what Jingke was thinking.</p>

    <p>It is the first time for a swordsman to become a master. Moreover, the position of master is appointed by Wang Ling. This makes Jingke a little nervous: "Really. Is that okay?"</p>

    <p>"You are my sword. No problem."Wang Ling stroked Jingke's white hair again and said with serious expression.</p>

    <p>Jingke was encouraged. He took a deep breath and then agreed: "Okay! I'll take him in!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. Jian Shen Square. Everyone nearby was exclaiming.</p>

    <p>They were inexplicably shocked. They looked at the numbers displayed on the sword tablet in front of them in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Those sword spirits who had not yet had time to join in the fun and were rushing towards Jian Shen Square in the distance stopped one by one at this time.</p>

    <p>I saw the immortal light shining brightly over there. The sudden movement of the sword monument caused the entire sky in the Sword King Realm to be rendered into colorful colors. These people had not yet seen clearly what was happening at the scene. They just felt shocked.</p>

    <p>"Which sword spirit is it? Why have I never felt this sword spirit?"</p>

    <p>"It is said to be a newly born little sword spirit. But a little sword spirit actually caused the sword monument to resonate so much?"</p>

    <p>Many sword spirits' eyes were stinging. The light in Jian Shen Square in front was so dazzling and so intense that it was hard to imagine.</p>

    <p>When they got closer, they saw Leng Ming, who was also stunned in front of the sword monument. They were all even more stunned.</p>

    <p>"Really a little sword spirit..."</p>

    <p>"Transformed by a piece of grass?"</p>

    <p>Many sword spirits were shocked. At the same time, they also smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>These non-metal swords. Each one is more powerful than the other...</p>

    <p>Metal sword. There is really no way to survive!!!</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>Carter could feel that there was a strong sour smell in the air. Many people here seemed to have turned into lemon people. She could subconsciously sense that among the sword spirits watching the scene, many people expressed their jealousy. turned into hostility towards Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Carter didn't even think about it. She rushed forward to protect Leng Ming immediately. She took Leng Ming's hand and took Leng Ming away from the scene without saying a word.</p>

    <p>"Everyone be quiet!"</p>

    <p>"Keep quiet!" Wu Jin and Lao Man cooperated tacitly. They immediately maintained order at the scene.</p>

    <p>In the Sword King Realm, it is common practice to bully newly born sword spirits...</p>

    <p>Whether it is a person or a sword spirit, there will always be jealousy. Leng Ming's qualifications have already made many sword spirits have murderous intentions in their hearts.</p>

    <p>If Leng Ming is captured, use the evil magic circle to forcefully devour Leng Ming. This is also a way for the sword spirit to improve himself.</p>

    <p>But this method is regarded as evil and is not recognized by the sword king world.</p>

    <p>But after Leng Ming took this test, his results were really dazzling.</p>

    <p>It is essential to be on guard against others. There must still be sword spirits who are willing to do that.</p>

    <p>"You are protecting him now. Is it possible that you can protect him for the rest of your life?" Some people were dissatisfied and stood up.</p>

    <p>To many people, Leng Ming was just a little sword spirit, a nameless grass! Now this grass was emitting light. For a while, many sword spirits were jealous and almost had a mental breakdown.</p>

    <p>Although he clearly lacked combat power, he took the first place in bronze in this sword monument test!</p>

    <p>Even this test result... surpassed many people in the king group.</p>

    <p>"Impossible...how could this happen...there must be something wrong with the sword monument!" Dian Ming felt like he had been slapped hard.</p>

    <p>Previously, he was putting on airs in front of Leng Ming, which was noticed by everyone. Now his performance in Jianbei was beaten by Leng Ming, which made Dian Ming feel that he could not lose face.</p>

    <p>"Who wants to do it? Just try." Carter said coldly. Her Death Lotus was already ready to move.</p>

    <p>Her gaze intimidated many sword spirits.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a flawless white sword light fell from the sky. The person who came was none other than Mo Yu, one of Yu Ling's best friends, who came after receiving the news.</p>

    <p>Mo Yu was wearing a white short skirt, long black hair, and a jade crown on top of her head. She was very beautiful, and her whole body exuded a sweet fragrance: "You can't do anything in the Sword Capital City." Whoever takes action will do so at their own risk."</p>

    <p>The girl saw everything from a distance. After landing, she was also carrying out deterrence work.</p>

    <p>Competition judges and stuff. The most interesting!</p>

    <p>"You can't do anything in the Sword Capital. But there will always be times when you can't protect him."</p>

    <p>At this time, Dian Ming snorted. He vented all the anger of losing face on Leng Ming: "Boy, you are not good at fighting. There will always be times when these people can't protect you! Just wait!"</p>

    <p>He just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>I saw a brown sword energy coming from the sky...</p>

    <p>Like a meteorite, the sword storm directly pierced the Sword King Realm. It pierced the position of Jian Shen Square!</p>

    <p>It was just a trace of sword energy, but its power was so powerful that it was unimaginable. It instantly transformed into an existence like a divine punishment horse, and was poured into Dian Ming accurately.</p>

    <p>Dian Ming was so shocked by the sword pressure brought by this sword energy that he vomited blood. His whole body sank deeply into the earth, leaving only one head exposed.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked!</p>

    <p>Such a powerful sword that is invincible in the world...</p>

    <p>There is only one person in the sword king world who can do it!</p>

    <p>"It's Lord Jingke!"</p>

    <p>"It was the sword master who took action. This incident actually alarmed the sword master..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Leng Ming is my disciple."</p>

    <p>And soon, Jingke's extraterrestrial voice resounded throughout the Sword King Realm, shaking the minds of all sword spirits: "Whoever becomes an enemy will bear the consequences at their own risk..."</p>
