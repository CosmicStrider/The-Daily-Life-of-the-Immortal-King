  <h1>Chapter 1616 The Mysterious Transformers</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This bet seems meaningless to Sun Rong. Jiang Yingying has no chance of winning at all levels.</p>

    <p>Although Jiang Yingying's behavior seems to be reckless, he has been under the influence of Marshal Jiang since he was a child. He will not fight a battle with no chance of winning.</p>

    <p>Therefore. When Sun Rong saw Jiang Yingying rushing into his office with great momentum, claiming that he wanted to bet against him.</p>

    <p>Her first reaction was that there might be someone behind Jiang Yingying to back her up.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong first excluded Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche recently. Very honest.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong knew that his grandfather had actually warned him, so he would not directly support Jiang Yingying on something like this that went against him.</p>

    <p>If Jiang Xiaoche is excluded, the second most suspected person is Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi is already in the same camp, so he is also excluded by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>So who is the remaining person most likely to help Jiang Yingying?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that before the test officially starts, it is necessary to investigate the whereabouts of Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Originally, she would ask Jiang Xiaoche or one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception to cooperate with the internal intelligence network to handle this matter.</p>

    <p>But now. Gray Cult is at its peak.</p>

    <p>Those fanatical Gray Cult believers are simply human "control guards."</p>

    <p>There is really too much information that can be provided to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>All you need is Sun Rong to publish a message in the group of core members with the "leader order."</p>

    <p>This will immediately trigger a response from the Gray Cult branch management, thus linking the entire Gray Cult. Gathering the power of everyone's information, we can get the information we want as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Of course. Considering that Jiang Yingying himself is also a Gray Cult believer. And he is one of the earliest Gray Cult believers.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong issued the leader's order, he paid special attention to it and told those branch members to avoid the Gray Cult group where Jiang Yingying was.</p>

    <p>"The leader's order! The leader has issued an order! We need the whereabouts of this girl Jiang Yingying in recent days!"</p>

    <p>"Order from the leader! Target. All the whereabouts of Miss Jiang Yingying within a week! Anyone who provides clues will be rewarded with 2,000 yuan! No limit to the number!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Student Union Office. Sun Rong looked at the balance that was constantly being deducted from the mobile wallet. There was no wave in his heart.</p>

    <p>Just this number in the wallet. According to the deduction of two thousand and two thousand. Even if it is deducted every thirty seconds, it will not be fully deducted until next year.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She didn't take money as an external thing so seriously.</p>

    <p>About an hour ago. Sun Rong found what he wanted from a bunch of video materials.</p>

    <p>This is a piece of surveillance information provided by a Gray Cult believer who works in a tea restaurant.</p>

    <p>Under surveillance. Jiang Yingying is dining with a handsome young man with long hair and black and purple robes.</p>

    <p>This young man's skin is fairer than snow. He has a star-like temperament and is well behaved. He was chatting and laughing with Jiang Yingying in front of the tea restaurant.</p>

    <p>This person Sun Rong has never been seen before. But he vaguely feels that judging from his temperament, he seems to have a sense of déjà vu.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that such a person would be the focus of others if he appeared in a downtown area. As a result, many people around him turned a blind eye to him.</p>

    <p>Is it using a spell similar to the "Great Shielding Spell" to reduce the sense of presence?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is confused about this.</p>

    <p>If this person takes a low-key route.</p>

    <p>So why was surveillance cameras allowed to film him?</p>

    <p>Are you not afraid that your identity will be investigated at all?</p>

    <p>The investigation ends here.</p>

    <p>People have already captured it. The full HD footage is also available.</p>

    <p>But who exactly. Sun Rong cannot be investigated yet.</p>

    <p>Then, she used her family's intelligent AI system to conduct comparisons in Huaguo Shuilian Group's huge customer data database.</p>

    <p>The result is still nothing.</p>

    <p>This is very helpless.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sat in her seat and sighed. She didn't want to ask the seniors in the Office of Strategic Deception to cause trouble for everyone.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that just taking a picture of this person is of no use.</p>

    <p>You must find out your identity.</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen. I'm sorry! I've tried my best to investigate. I got the video of the person I wanted to investigate. But I don't know this person. I wonder if you seniors could recognize him?" Sun Rong said. Sun Rong sent the surveillance screenshot to the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Huh? He looks somewhat similar to Sect Master Diulei. Could it be the real king himself? Or maybe the real king actually has a younger brother..."</p>

    <p>"I don't have a younger brother... Don't spread rumors!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei wiped his sweat: "Strange. I have never seen this person before. He is very unfamiliar. And he looks similar to me! Logically speaking, all the brothers and sisters here know about it. I have a wide circle of friends. Almost all of them are The type of photographic memory. I can remember everyone's face and name clearly after just seeing them once. If I have met this person before, I will never forget it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Speaking of which, judging from this person's appearance, he should be the type that Cailian Zhenren likes, right?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Looking at his facial features, he does have the potential to be a handsome guy. But it's a pity. I don't like boys who are too fat."</p>

    <p>"Fat man? This man is not fat?" Sun Rong asked doubtfully.</p>

    <p>The man she saw on the surveillance camera was a pretty standard handsome guy.</p>

    <p>Of course... In comparison, she still prefers Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Isn't he a fat man? He looks just like Mugu, the leader of the Yue Ban Sect." Cailian Zhenren was also particularly surprised about this. She rubbed her eyes and was sure that she had seen it correctly. The person in this screenshot was indeed a fat man.</p>

    <p>"She's definitely not fat. She's obviously a short-haired, big-breasted beauty!"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense... Isn't it a fair-skinned boy? He just has a pair of animal ears for some reason. Isn't the animalization incident over? Could it be the body of a certain spiritual beast?"</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about? Why are all the orcs coming out? The one in the screenshot is obviously a long-legged guy. And his hair style is very cool."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was horrified.</p>

    <p>It's just a screenshot of the video. As a result, what everyone saw was that the people talking and laughing with Jiang Yingying were actually different!</p>

    <p>"If everyone sees a different person, then this person must be casting a spell."</p>

    <p>Then, I heard Immortal Toya sigh. He directly sent a voice analysis in the group: "And this person's level is not low. He can actually deceive the eyes of so many people in our core member group. Let everyone see him. They are all different. This kind of strength is probably far beyond the True Immortal level combat power."</p>

    <p>"Looks like things are getting interesting."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "Miss Sun, it is better not to investigate this matter now. Leave it to us. Once we have the results, I will tell you immediately. I will definitely find out this mysterious Transformer."</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, Senior Diulei. Is this person very powerful?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Probably a big boss. So we don't want Miss Sun to get hurt." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded: "Although I don't know what this person's purpose is. But he usually shields himself like this. He is 100% a powerful person. Look at Brother Ling, isn't this the case..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone nodded.</p>

    <p>Only on this matter, everyone's opinions were unanimous. But no one had any reason to refute.</p>

    <p>Because it makes so much sense.</p>
