  <h1>Chapter 1972 Qu Shuling's counterattack</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment, a trace of suspicion flashed through Li Changzhe's heart. He didn't know if it was an illusion. He felt that Zhan Ye seemed to be different from before.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, this situation should not happen. Because Zhanye's own materials are already very special. Use the fourth-level materials they collected to repair the cracks. Logically speaking, it should be just enough to restore it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the conditions for weapon refining here are very limited. As far as Li Changzhe knows, this is only repaired by a few elite high school students who are proficient in weapon refining. Under such circumstances, it is a miracle that the repair can be completed... let alone strengthening.</p>

    <p>With doubts in his heart, Li Changzhe tried to change Zhan Ye's hands.</p>

    <p>This time, the illusion of the Milky Way did not appear before his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Is it true that I'm hallucinating?" He muttered to himself as he played with Zhan Ye. The sword seemed to be obedient and showed no other reaction at all.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Zhang Linyan asked.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I just feel that Brother Qu's sword seems to have been repaired a little too well. It doesn't look like it was made by a high school student..." Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling remained silent. Did not dare to continue the conversation.</p>

    <p>This time the repair work was done by Zhenyuan. It is naturally extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Besides, it was just a piece of eighth-level cosmic material that was fused into the Sky Wall. You must know that the Zhenyuan Immortal people were trying to create a planet. That was much more difficult than refining a weapon.</p>

    <p>"Among the elite high school students, there is indeed a hidden dragon and a crouching tiger. The repair of this sword is really good. Although I also know some methods of refining weapons, but in terms of skills, I am not as mature as these elder brothers who practice swords." Zhang Linyan carefully observed the repair. The blade of the sword. I was also amazed in my heart.</p>

    <p>"Indeed! If you have the chance, I really want to meet those brothers who are making weapons. Then find a place to try the sword!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Li Changzhe laughed loudly: "I've been envious of Brother Qu's sword for a long time. Do you want to find a place to practice sword practice? Such a high-level spiritual sword is not something you can usually come into contact with. It's just right. Let's go back for the trial this time. I will catch up with the monthly exam of the Spirit Sword class later. It would be better to take Brother Qu's sword and look for it in advance."</p>

    <p>"Good idea."</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's surprise, Zhang Linyan actually agreed with Li Changzhe's opinion: "We come to the spirit world to practice, actually. Qu Shuling's Zhanye is difficult to control because of its special materials. If we can master it, then the Spirit Sword Exam will definitely not be a problem."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe nodded, like a chicken pecking at rice: "Yes. Look at Wang Ling. He has always used that peach wood sword. It's too pitiful. This is a good spiritual sword. The difference is still huge. I can see it. Wang Ling Ah! I will give you a demonstration later!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Wang Ling suddenly had an ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the deep dream fruit forest on the other side, Qu Shuling's eyelids twitched. Just when Twenty Peaks were about to launch a surprise attack with special human figurines on Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>This top-ranked elite high school student woke up early and without warning, unexpectedly by everyone.</p>

    <p>Shen Mengguo recovered some of Qu Shuling's injuries to a certain extent. He remained calm. He just closed his eyes slightly to observe the situation around him.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling discovered that four miners were guarding him.</p>

    <p>Jam made from grinding Deep Dream Fruit was floating on the ground not far away. Qu Shuling immediately judged that these people would feed him some every once in a while so that he could always fall into a deep sleep.</p>

    <p>However, what these people would not have thought of is that as the number one elite high school student, Qu Shuling actually carries out special resistance training to deal with this kind of situation.</p>

    <p>Although the resistance level has not reached the highest level, Qu Shuling still has some resistance to those spiritual fruits with additional status and poisonous spiritual fruits.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he was able to wake up early before the time for Shen Meng Guo to fall asleep.</p>

    <p>So interesting...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qu Shuling pretended to be asleep, but was actually adjusting his state.</p>

    <p>He sensed Zhan Ye's position. As a result, there was a tingling sensation in his mind. This signal directly told Qu Shuling that Zhan Ye had fallen into the hands of others.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe, Zhang Linyan...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling almost felt a sense of hatred. He chewed these two names in his heart like teeth. He has always been firmly ranked as the number one high school student. He never thought that his position would be challenged by others.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. In this trial match, these two people directly exposed their identities as disciples of the Mist God and the Arrow God.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly made Qu Shuling feel complicated. He felt that his emotions should not be called jealousy. But he didn't know why he couldn't swallow this breath.</p>

    <p>"--Sword comes!"</p>

    <p>A surge of anger suddenly rose from his heart. When Qu Shuling called for the spirit sword to appear again, a spirit sword as pure as the bright moon appeared magnificently under the shroud of the moonlight in the dark night.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"</p>

    <p>The four miners who were guarding Qu Shuling while chatting were shocked at the same time.</p>

    <p>No one thought that Qu Shuling actually had a second spiritual sword besides Zhan Ye - Yue Li!</p>

    <p>This is a trump card that Qu Shuling has never used before. No one has ever thought that this is Qu Shuling's real killer move hidden behind him!</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling originally planned to sacrifice Yue Li when the Earth Center Project started.</p>

    <p>But now, after all, the plan cannot keep up with the changes. He can only reveal his final trump card in advance.</p>

    <p>The combat power of this Yue Li is several times more terrifying than that of Zhan Ye. The moment it was summoned, under the cover of the hazy moonlight, Yue Li's sword edge shuttled back and forth around. Immediately, there were weapons and swords coming from all around. The sound of flesh being cut.</p>

    <p>The protection mechanism of the four miners was immediately triggered and they were forced to exit the spirit world without realizing it.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>There was another sharp sound of sword. Qu Shuling directly controlled Yue Li to cut off the beef tendon ropes tied to his hands and feet.</p>

    <p>He moved his wrists and slowly stood up from the ground. Although he fell asleep for a long time, thanks to the help of the Deep Dream Fruit, his injuries and spiritual power were also able to recover a lot.</p>

    <p>I will never let you go...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling muttered to himself, staring deeply in one direction.</p>

    <p>Then a ball of spiritual power gathered on his fingertips. After drawing a few symbols in the void, a golden spiritual sword contract appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>This is the spiritual sword contract between Qu Shuling and Zhan Ye. Now it is no longer needed for Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth and with a cruel heart, ordered Yue Li again to chop this contract into pieces!</p>

    <p>At this point, he had no relationship with Zhan Ye at all.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling is a person with mysophobia.</p>

    <p>When he thought that his spiritual sword Zhan Ye had been touched by others, this sword was already useless to Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the Yue Li he has now is much stronger than Zhan Ye!</p>
