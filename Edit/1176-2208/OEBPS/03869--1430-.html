  <h1>Chapter 1430 Peng Xiren</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the Chaos Facehuggers are difficult to deal with, they are just minions sent by the opposite party after all.</p>

    <p>This is the most basic test of the opponent.</p>

    <p>The real trump card has not yet been released.</p>

    <p>And at the same time that the Sword King Realm was attacked, the earth was not what Wang Ling and the monk expected. At the same time, it was attacked by Chaos Facehuggers from the Infinite Galaxy.</p>

    <p>Those eggs that were born invisibly and looked colorful when light passed through them.</p>

    <p>It is raining down like heavy snowdrops, along the longitude and latitude lines of the earth, at various coordinate positions.</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal In front of the main hall. The monk walked out of the hall and looked up at the sky.</p>

    <p>Such facehuggers are a huge trouble for the sword spirits in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>It was not long after the earth was upgraded. It will take some time to develop until the quality of cultivators around the world improves.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, it is simply difficult to resist such a large-scale attack.</p>

    <p>"Senior, as expected. Satellites around the world have been jammed. The Huaxiu Alliance is still asking us what happened. The Head of State is very angry." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Facing the fear of the unknown. It's normal to have such a reaction."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded and said: "With the current quality of cultivators on earth, it is normal for them not to be able to feel these things born in chaos."</p>

    <p>In fact, the monk was already prepared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Since the earth was handed over to him, even if he risked his life, he would still protect the earth.</p>

    <p>As early as last night, the monk had cast a Buddhist net over the entire earth.</p>

    <p>Although it cannot completely filter out facehuggers, it can resist more than 90% of intrusions.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned: "I still don't understand. What is their purpose of attacking the earth..."</p>

    <p>"The purpose must be for Miss Rong and the little sword spirit Leng Ming. Leng Ming is of great use to them. And the Aohai in Miss Rong's hand has been fused with 4 old Rubik's cubes. As for attacking the earth, I'm afraid it's just a side trip."</p>

    <p>"Just a quickie?"</p>

    <p>"Hasn't Zhenjun noticed it yet?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk turned his head and looked at Lord Diulei: "The ninth of the nine Rubik's Cubes laid out by Dao Ancestor Wang is on the earth. But this old ninth Rubik's Cube has long been replaced by Ling Zhenren. It fell."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was shocked when he heard this: "When... when did this happen?"</p>

    <p>"When I upgraded Aohai for the first time for Miss Rong," the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Then what girl Sun Rong has in Aohai now actually contains five Rubik's cubes???"</p>

    <p>"Yes! But we are worried that Miss Rong cannot control the power very well, so we have not activated this Rubik's Cube for the time being."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "So the other party's long-cherished wish to recycle this old Rubik's Cube this time is probably impossible to fulfill."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then since the other party can think of snatching the ninth one along the way, does that mean that in addition to the five old Rubik's Cubes in the hand of Sun Rong, the other party also has the remaining four? Already collected?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>"So. Everything was planned?"</p>

    <p>"Let them help collect it. Miss Rong can also relax a little bit."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded: "After all, the old Rubik's Cube collection trip is very risky. The Eternal Star that Miss Rong went to seems to be very friendly. But in fact, it is full of dangers. It was all planned by Ling Zhenren and Master Ying in advance. The angry Eternal Star people. It's really scary."</p>

    <p>"How to do it? Give me money? Brother Ke Ling has always been poor. Where did he get so much money..."</p>

    <p>"Just one sentence is enough. For example: If you don't obey, all of them will be destroyed. Something like that."</p>

    <p>"..." Lord Diulei was shocked.</p>

    <p>This is definitely a naked threat!!!</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk raised his eyes.</p>

    <p>Through the swastika, you can see that the Buddhist net laid out last night has begun to be triggered.</p>

    <p>There are still 10% of Chaos Facehuggers left on the earth. This part needs to be cleaned up manually.</p>

    <p>For this reason, the monk found the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception last night and cast a temporary consecration spell on everyone's "Niwan Palace."</p>

    <p>Niwan Palace is the spiritual hub. Under the influence of the consecration technique, the spiritual perception ability can be greatly improved in a short period of time, allowing everyone's spiritual awareness to expand.</p>

    <p>Everything is to make it easier for the Office of Strategic Deception to find these facehuggers left on the earth.</p>

    <p>"Please, sect master, please follow the established orders."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Lord Diulei bowed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After watching Lord Diulei leave and arrange the mission, the monk stood on tiptoe lightly and left the ground. It turned into a beam of light and broke through the earth's atmosphere like a rocket and entered outer space.</p>

    <p>The ninth old Rubik's Cube. The opponent is bound to get it.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the Rubik's Cube on the earth has been replaced a long time ago. So why do monks still work so hard to protect the earth?</p>

    <p>The reason is simple...</p>

    <p>Because you don't work hard, the other party may not take the bait easily.</p>

    <p>The harder we try to protect it, the more we can show the illusion that "this thing is important to us."</p>

    <p>Everything is to deceive the other party into using their strength. Bring this "new Rubik's Cube" back...</p>

    <p>The new Rubik's Cube has traps.</p>

    <p>If the opponent takes it back, maybe they don't even have to steal the tower. They can just blow up the base crystal on the opposite side...</p>

    <p>So far. All operations are going smoothly.</p>

    <p>However, the monk did not relax his vigilance.</p>

    <p>After all, the opponent comes from the Infinite Galaxy. And this is the first time the monk has seen a Chaos Facehugger of this size.</p>

    <p>Since the opponent can collect so many insect eggs to launch an attack, this matter has been planned for many years.</p>

    <p>Once you choose to take action, you must be extremely confident in your actions.</p>

    <p>"Sir, come out... poor monk. It's right here."</p>

    <p>Not far from the earth. The monk is wearing a purple and gold cassock. He is staring at somewhere.</p>

    <p>Soon, a figure surrounded by stars appeared.</p>

    <p>The young man was surrounded by stars. His figure gradually condensed into a solid body.</p>

    <p>"Monk, I haven't seen you for many years. You are still so innocent." The young man surrounded by stars seemed to know the monk. He came up and said hello.</p>

    <p>The young man is handsome, tall and fair, and his fair skin is particularly eye-catching under the starlight.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren...</p>

    <p>The monk's lifelong enemy.</p>

    <p>But he died a long time ago.</p>

    <p>But about this incident, the monk had a premonition and felt that this person might still be alive.</p>

    <p>Everything was exactly as he expected. The monk looked calm and stared at the other person: "That fortune teller must be you."</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren smiled. He didn't want to admit it.</p>

    <p>"You, who have always been aloof and arrogant, have become someone else's pawn. If Dao Ancestor knew about it, he would be very disappointed." The monk lowered his eyes slightly and sighed.</p>

    <p>"It's just. Everyone takes what they need."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren put his hands behind his back and corrected: "I am not a chess piece. I am just that person's chess object. Everything is based on equal conditions... If something really goes wrong in the end, I can kill him." It's just a matter of raising your hand."</p>

    <p>"You are too confident."</p>

    <p>The monk frowned slightly: "You still don't understand that person. You don't know how much Dao Ancestor spent in order to seal him..."</p>

    <p>"Stop talking nonsense, bald donkey. You don't understand me at all."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren looked at the monk in front of him with a smile: "Because I am the only disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang..."</p>
