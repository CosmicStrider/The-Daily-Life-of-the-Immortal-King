  <h1>Chapter 1661 Forward this koi...then...danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ming decided to use the identity of Jia Bugui to lead the fourth group of Lord Diulei's people into the core area, the faces of several women flashed back in his mind.</p>

    <p>As one of the few powerful people in the core area who runs various romantic places and has almost formed a monopoly, Jia Bugui has a natural advantage in his position in the core area, but in fact he also has a lot of debts.</p>

    <p>These debts are not money. They are real. Romance debts...</p>

    <p>When it comes to emotional issues, Wang Ming has always been single-minded. He has never really been in love with anyone, but once he has given his feelings, he will be determined to the end.</p>

    <p>In fact, when his brain waves intervened in Jia Bugui's body, Wang Ming also had his own concerns.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he felt Jia Bugui's romantic personality and worried that it would contaminate his pure self and make him unclean.</p>

    <p>However, after considering that Jia Bugui's identity was indeed helpful to their mission plan for this trip, they finally made up their mind to control his body.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the brain waves that completely activated Jia Bugui merged with his brain waves...</p>

    <p>This was the last step that Wang Ming took to face death.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this is just a small stream of brain waves separated from his body. If it is contaminated later, just don't put it back.</p>

    <p>Stay here forever. It's a better choice...</p>

    <p>Everyone set off on the road one after another.</p>

    <p>To avoid arousing suspicion.</p>

    <p>The two carriages were led by Zhuo Yi and Wang Ming respectively. They deliberately took off after a period of time.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and others went first.</p>

    <p>After passing the exclusive and only main road.</p>

    <p>The core area of the Science and Technology City. This imperial city, shrouded in jewels and exuding an aura of luxury, appeared in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>In the central city, above the ancient castle, a beam of light connecting all the will guards and building a powerful defensive barrier was released from the top of the tower. It formed an umbrella-like protection like a birdcage, covering everything in this imperial city. Inside.</p>

    <p>"It seems. That's the target..." Zhuo Yi saw that scene in the distance. He felt a little surprised. He thought that he had been following Wang Ling for so many days. I have witnessed many big scenes.</p>

    <p>But now when he stood here, the sight in front of him made his body tremble slightly, a little uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Is this... the power of an eternity-level expert?</p>

    <p>Although I had already felt a slight sense of oppression when I was in the slums, when I really entered the imperial city in the core area.</p>

    <p>When this world, which was built by the Eternal Powerful Man using the most powerful laws, was all presented in front of him, the feeling of trembling in his heart was undeniable.</p>

    <p>It gave Zhuo Yi an incomprehensible feeling for the first time.</p>

    <p>Of course, what made him feel even more out of reach at this moment was not the oppression brought about by the laws of these eternal powerful men.</p>

    <p>But he was thinking about another thing...</p>

    <p>That is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He knows very well how powerful Wang Ling is.</p>

    <p>But the truth is. Wang Ling has never shown 100% of his strength in front of him.</p>

    <p>The rules established by this eternal strong man already made him feel like this.</p>

    <p>If one day, Wang Ling completely lifts the seal, what will it look like?</p>

    <p>In the [Team Voice Space]. Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi and Qin Zhong set up a separate space for secret communication to prevent the hired grooms driving in front from hearing their plans.</p>

    <p>"That's the beam that links the Will Guard." Qin Zhong touched his chin and squinted his eyes.</p>

    <p>Their current location was still far away from the castle. However, the light beam from the top of the castle made him feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>"This light makes me uncomfortable," he said.</p>

    <p>"Me too." Zhou Ziyi trembled.</p>

    <p>He has the lowest level of strength among all the people. If he hadn't been wearing five layers of thermal underwear. Zhuo Yi even suspected that he would have fainted as soon as he entered the imperial city.</p>

    <p>"But no matter how uncomfortable it is, we have to endure it first. For now, we still have to find a way to hook Master Wu Xin and his disciple Nawei out. If we want to destroy this beam, there should be many ways."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said this. He suddenly asked Qin Zhong: "Speaking of which, I haven't seen you use any magic weapon?"</p>

    <p>"As for weapons, I have them too. I just don't use them often."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong said. He spread his hands: "And it has been upgraded to a chaos device for a while. But every time before I draw the sword, the incident has been solved perfectly. There is no room for me to use it."</p>

    <p>"Are you showing off something..."</p>

    <p>"No, Brother Zhuo. Everything I said is true."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong laughed: "I'm just a little luckier than others. You can't blame me."</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this time, a shutter flashed. Zhuo Yi took a photo of Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Didn't you say that you have better luck? I'll take a picture of you and forward it to you. Can this mission go smoothly?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi burst into laughter holding her stomach: "Brother Zhuo regards Brother Qin Zhong as a koi! Good luck by forwarding it?"</p>

    <p>In the carriage, the atmosphere fell into silence for a while.</p>

    <p>After about a few seconds, Qin Zhong suddenly felt that the atmosphere had dropped to freezing point with a visible degree...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is holding the phone. It can be seen that he is shaking...</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo?" Qin Zhong asked tentatively.</p>

    <p>"I...I sent it..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi, Qin Zhong: "???"</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Isn't this Virtual Realm equivalent to another world? Why is there a mobile signal!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is so horrifying.</p>

    <p>This is the same world. The same movement...</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to post Qin Zhong's photo in his circle of friends. He originally planned to set it as a private photo, which only he could see. In order to avoid misunderstandings caused by Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>As a result, he was just in a trance. He just sent it out...</p>

    <p>And something fatal just happened.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi not only saw it! He also gave him a like...</p>

    <p>So now. Zhuo Yi's cold sweat started flowing down instantly.</p>

    <p>"It's over...it's all over..." At this moment, inside the carriage, Zhuo Yi felt like he was looking up at the dark sky.</p>

    <p>"As long as I'm here, my sister-in-law won't do anything to you." Qin Zhong laughed.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he didn't quite know why such a coincidence happened.</p>

    <p>But normally. In this case. It looks like Zhuo Yi is unlucky... As long as he's with him in the world. Because of the cohesion of luck. Qin Zhong feels certain that in other ways. They will have extraordinary luck.</p>

    <p>"Anyway. Zhuo, don't think too much..."</p>

    <p>"I've been thinking. Should I go to the casket shop now and order me a coffin."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "In this Imperial City, the man Mr. Ming possessed, Jia Bugui, is very powerful. He must be able to find the other two groups led by Shi Niang and Li Xian.</p>

    <p>That's true. It's just that Zhuo Yi feels a little embarrassed to meet Jiugong Liangzi now.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Brother Zhuo is right. But have you ever thought about the possibility that we might meet my sister-in-law when we walk on the road?" Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"No way..." Hearing these words, Zhuo Yi suddenly raised his head.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong was originally just joking.</p>

    <p>The result was disastrous. He had just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>Outside the carriage window, three familiar cloaked figures passed by their carriage...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Qin Zhong with horror: "Excuse me... Your mouth. Is this mouth of yours enlightened as well?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "?"</p>
