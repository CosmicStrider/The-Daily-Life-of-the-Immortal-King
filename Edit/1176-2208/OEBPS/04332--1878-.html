  <h1>Chapter 1878 Self-explosion of identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was just one punch. King Tiankun was instantly wiped out. Emperor Dongda immediately felt a strong sense of astonishment.</p>

    <p>This is not what he wants to see. Because it is not in the script of the diary at all!</p>

    <p>Originally, according to the plot in the diary, he would only severely injure King Tiankun, but not to the point where he would be completely wiped out.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why was he beaten to death directly?" Wang Ying asked. The expression on his face was as calm as Wang Ling. The two of them felt that things had become interesting.</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling thought that since this eternal journey was planned, there would definitely be some troubles in the middle. It would not be possible to follow the plot in the diary so smoothly.</p>

    <p>At first, he thought that Emperor Dongda and the person who guided him in writing the diary were in the same group, so he concealed the truth and refused to reveal his identity.</p>

    <p>But judging from the current results, it is obvious that Emperor Dongda didn't know anything about the change in the diary track. He was even a little confused.</p>

    <p>"No. I didn't want to kill him at all...Senior Wang didn't help me. The punch I just punched was simply not strong enough to kill him." Within the team's voice skills, Emperor Dongda responded. It's also incredible.</p>

    <p>"Now it seems that this matter was probably set up by someone together." At this time, Sun Rong added.</p>

    <p>According to the original diary track, King Tiankun was only seriously injured. Even Emperor Xi was just left dumb.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a place with strict order in the central galaxy. King Tiankun directly used the method of killing people and stealing goods. Then he was seriously injured by Dongda's counterattack. No matter where he got it, Dongda took advantage of it.</p>

    <p>But now that King Tiankun is dead, it is not just an ordinary conflict issue. It is directly designed into a diplomatic issue between the two domains.</p>

    <p>The person who died was King Tiankun. The most famous prince in the Western Regions! The general who also guarded the Western Regions! He was represented by the title of the Western Great Emperor. His overall strength was second only to the Western Great Emperor!</p>

    <p>Such a person ends up being beaten to death...</p>

    <p>This is something no one expected.</p>

    <p>At this point, the sounds of commotion began to be heard on the streets of the ancient city.</p>

    <p>Because King Tiankun suddenly disappeared under this punch. Everyone did not realize that King Tiankun was killed. They felt that the prince might have used some means to escape.</p>

    <p>Many people were talking about it for a while. Only Dongda's side knew clearly that King Tiankun died completely. His body was completely destroyed, and not even ashes were left behind.</p>

    <p>Several people were at a loss when the two snake attendants who had been following King Tiankun suddenly came over with their graceful bodies.</p>

    <p>The two snake women pretended to be facing a formidable enemy. One of them, snake woman Number 1, glared at Emperor Dongda: "You guy! You actually used such despicable methods. If my prince hadn't escaped quickly, I'd be afraid. He'd be seriously injured by your hands!"</p>

    <p>Dongda: "..."</p>

    <p>Snake Girl Number 2 saw this and quickly echoed: "Yes. Just wait! After my prince regains his strength, he will definitely come to you for revenge!"</p>

    <p>The two of them cursed loudly, as if they were afraid that the people around them wouldn't hear.</p>

    <p>It was only then that everyone around them understood the "truth" of the matter.</p>

    <p>Oh, it turns out that King Tiankun's soles were greased! He was also said to be the representative of the Western Emperor! He started the fight and ended up running away. This is so cowardly!</p>

    <p>For a time, many people on the street started talking.</p>

    <p>The area around the temple became chaotic for a while. Everyone had no choice but to find a place to hold a meeting before making long-term plans. Now the historical trajectory in the diary has been disrupted.</p>

    <p>King Tiankun was beaten to death. This is considered a key plot point. No one knows what will happen next.</p>

    <p>As for the two snake girls who sing and talk like crosstalk, Wang Ling is basically convinced that these two snake girls are of their own.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, they would never instigate King Tiankun to start a war with Emperor Dongda...</p>

    <p>Another very important point is that they actually just helped Emperor Dongda to temporarily smooth things over.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for these two snake girls, he'd afraid everyone would know that something happened to King Tiankun.</p>

    <p>However, whether it was Wang Ling or Emperor Dongda, they knew very well that this was just a temporary measure. After all, the battle took place in front of the temple, and in front of the idols of the other three realm emperors.</p>

    <p>If this matter is over early, it will be impossible to stop the fire. It will be discovered. It's just a matter of time before it is discovered.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu had mentioned Chunlan Tower before, so Emperor Dongda immediately asked Zhang Zhui to spend money to take over the entire Chunlan Tower.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda (Wang Ling, Wang Ying), Saint of the Holy Stone Cult (Wang Zhen), and Sun Goddess (Sun Rong) who has been renamed Xia Zinian are sitting in a private room.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Li Ren (Zhang Zhui) was with the Wangu trio. Chen Ren, Guo Jie, Sun Fu and Mrs. Shanxiu were seated in another private room.</p>

    <p>As for Mei Yunhai, he was treated as a tool and held the door at the restaurant.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling waited for a while. With this powerful spiritual perception, he soon heard the news about the two snake girls under King Tiankun.</p>

    <p>He had already greeted Mei Yunhai. Therefore, when he saw the two snake girls arriving, Mei Yunhai did not stop them and let them go.</p>

    <p>After the two entered the door, they immediately ran towards Dongda's house.</p>

    <p>The expressions on their faces were very nervous and uneasy. They seemed to have mustered up a lot of courage to come here.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me...are you..." one of the snake girls said. Without saying anything else, she began to confirm her identity directly.</p>

    <p>Obviously. The two snake girls had received the code that Wang Ling had previously sent out by auctioning the imaginary hair of the mythical beast in the auction house.</p>

    <p>But before Snake Number 1 opened her mouth, Wang Ying immediately interrupted and said, "That's right. I'm Wang Ying."</p>

    <p>After saying this, the two snake girls looked at each other. They were very clever. When they saw Wang Ying interjecting directly, they immediately understood. Wang Ling should be in the same body as Wang Ying. And it is definitely still hidden now. Because he didn't want to expose his identity, he asked Wang Ying to come forward.</p>

    <p>"As expected, it's you, Senior Wang." Snake Girl Number 1 sighed after she figured everything out. She then began to reveal her identity: "I am Liu Qingyi."</p>

    <p>Because it has completely deviated from the historical track. Now even if there is no need to form a team to communicate, it doesn't matter if you directly reveal their identities.</p>

    <p>Then she turned her attention to Xia Zinian, with a gentle look in her eyes: "This should be my good disciple, Rongrong, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this. She immediately laughed out loud: "Eh? Master, how did you know?"</p>

    <p>"After all, I have been your cheap master. Your little eyes are so catchy."</p>

    <p>With that said, Liu Qingyi, who played Snake Girl Number 1, turned her attention to the saint of the Holy Stone Sect.</p>

    <p>Just when everyone thought Liu Qingyi would guess Wang Zhen's identity, what people never expected was that Liu Qingyi actually raised his hand and slapped him in the face.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>The crisp sound of a blow made Wang Zhen a little confused: "What are you doing..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi had tears in her eyes. She immediately went over and hugged him: "Idiot! Do you know how worried I am about you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was stunned. He was about to hug Liu Qingyi, but blood began to ooze from the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi was immediately startled: "What's going on? I just slapped her lightly..."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda looked like he swallowed a mouthful of dog food. Then he wiped the sweat from his cheeks and said, "This brother Wang Zhen, the attached body is already pregnant. Miss Liu just slapped him. It should have moved his fetus. Made the baby angry."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi: "???"</p>
