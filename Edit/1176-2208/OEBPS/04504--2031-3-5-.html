  <h1>Chapter 2031 Beyond the 3 realms. Not among the 5 lines</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are outsiders sneaking into the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>This is something that has rarely happened in the history of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Although there have been several accidental intrusions in history, Sun Yiyuan knew very well that this senior ancient whale had never used the word "bug" to describe him.</p>

    <p>Because those who entered by mistake never went deep. Some even remained in a coma from beginning to end and never woke up.</p>

    <p>The adjective "bug" made Sun Yiyuan feel the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>This shows that this invader is trying to plunder the inherent wealth within the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>This man is quite courageous.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan snorted in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, most of the construction inside the Sun family's ancestral land was built by the Sun family's ancestors. It contains countless ancient array traps and various magic mechanisms. If you are not careful, you may be killed.</p>

    <p>Even Sun Yiyuan, after inheriting the position of head of the family, had to review the ancestral land construction map passed down from his ancestors every day to understand the layout of all traps.</p>

    <p>"This person is very dangerous. He has the guts to invade the ancestral land of the Sun family. He must not be an ordinary person when he walks into this hundred thousand mountains. I hope Dong Immortal will protect my two children for me. The three of you must follow me closely. Do not move around at will. " Sun Yiyuan said.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Boss Sun. I will do my best next time." Immortal Toya bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p>At the entrance to Shiwanda Mountain, there is an old stone tablet that looks simple and full of aura.</p>

    <p>This stone tablet is already a certain age. It is held up by the spiritual power of the ancient formation and suspended in the void. It is imprisoned by eight ancient locks around it, as if to prevent the stone from flying up.</p>

    <p>On the stone tablet, there are these words engraved: Beyond the Three Realms. Not among the Five Elements.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong remembers hearing this sentence before. It feels familiar.</p>

    <p>By the way, it's a sentence recorded on the last page of the Sun family's group training!</p>

    <p>"Did this sentence come from the ancestor of the Sun family? The words on the stone tablet were also carved by him? But I feel that it doesn't look like it." Sun Rong has actually seen the handwriting of the ancestor of the Sun family. It is a vigorous font. Have a sense of transcendence.</p>

    <p>It is completely opposite to the immortal and immortal aura on this stone tablet.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya understood it at a glance. He couldn't help but raise the corners of his lips and smiled: "That's not the case, Miss Sun. The words on it are the handwriting of my master, Laojun."</p>

    <p>In an instant, Wang Ling and Sun Rong said "Oh" almost in unison in their hearts. It suddenly dawned on them.</p>

    <p>If it comes from Laojun, then such handwriting seems normal.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Sun Rong is quite moved by this kind of friendship. There is even a hint of envy.</p>

    <p>What kind of friendship does it take to leave such an inscription in the ancestral land of the other party's clan after the friend's death?</p>

    <p>Um, that's not right. The ancestor may not be dead yet.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling now speculates that the ancestor of the Sun family may still be alive. And someone used the method of soul planting.</p>

    <p>If this had come from someone else, Sun Rong would definitely have taken it as a joke.</p>

    <p>"The inscriptions on this immortal stone were left behind by the ancestor's close friend, Senior Laojun." Sun Yiyuan looked at the immortal stone in the sky. At this time, he also felt thoughtful in his heart.</p>

    <p>"It is said that the first ancestor jumped out of the stone?"</p>

    <p>"You said it too. It's just a rumor. The ancestor is a human being. Of course he was born from a human. But this immortal stone is of great significance to the ancestor. It is said that the ancestor sat on it and realized the Tao when he was very young. It's like stepping into the realm of True Immortal."</p>

    <p>"Then the ancestor is very strong?"</p>

    <p>"The number of cultivators in ancient times was far less than it is now. The earth's spiritual energy is abundant. There are no restrictions from the International True Immortal Convention. Their natural strength is higher than that of modern cultivators. Although. The first Venerated Immortal in modern times was the one who suppressed Yuan Immortal people must be placed a long time ago. Before the modern civilization of the cultivation world was established, there were actually many Venerated Immortals."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan smiled and said: "Fortunately, the earth has been upgraded. Modern human cultivators can finally reach the heights of ancient humans.</p>

    <p>"The four of them said as they walked.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later Wang Ling followed Sun Yiyuan to the entrance of a cave.</p>

    <p>This is the first level in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It is called: There is a Cave in the Sky.</p>

    <p>In front of everyone, there are three entrances to the cave.</p>

    <p>"It is said that there are three things in life. Three things give rise to all things. This place is the [Different Cave Heaven] in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. After choosing the right one to enter, the second level is the 6 cave entrances. You must make the only choice again from these 6 cave entrances. If you choose correctly, you can enter the next level." Sun Yiyuan stroked his beard.</p>

    <p>"Is this... a maze? Does it mean that every time you choose the right one, there will be six more entrances? Mr. Boss Sun?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. No matter how many holes there are, there is only one correct answer. The other holes are all traps that will kill people."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan said and burst into laughter: "I see that little invading thief can't even get through the first pass in the 100,000 Mountains of my Sun family's ancestral land. When we go in this time, I'm afraid we have to collect his body." ."</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, do you remember the order of so many cave entrances?" Sun Rong asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"This is natural. I am the head of the Sun family." Sun Yiyuan said confidently. Then he took Wang Ling, Sun Rong and Immortal Toya into the cave together.</p>

    <p>When passing through the first few caves, Sun Yiyuan's performance was relatively easy. It was not until forty-eight entrances appeared in front of him that Boss Sun's thoughts were obviously a little confused.</p>

    <p>"I remember...it seems to be this..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan pointed to a cave entrance and said. Then he looked at the cave entrance on the right: "But it seems. This one is a bit like..."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun at this moment reminded Wang Ling of his friends who were doing multiple-choice questions.</p>

    <p>Especially when they don't know the answer. In their minds, almost every option seems to be the correct answer.</p>

    <p>Even if you finally eliminate two wrong answers, when faced with the final choice, you will often avoid the right answer perfectly...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled: "How about, junior, go in and take a look?"</p>

    <p>"Absolutely not. The more holes there are in a level, the more dangerous the trap will be."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan drank Immortal Toya. While laughing, he scratched his head awkwardly.</p>

    <p>He looked around. Finally, he took a deep breath. He looked at one of the cave entrances and made up his mind: "Okay! This is it! There will be no mistake! I will go in first. If there is no problem, you can go in again."</p>

    <p>"Okay, senior." Immortal Toya bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p>A minute later, Sun Yiyuan walked out of the cave. But his shoulder was bleeding. There was a sky-opening ax on it.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa, are you okay!" Sun Rong said in shock.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, haha. It's just a small accident." Sun Yiyuan pretended to be calm.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Mr. Boss Sun is indeed Mr. Boss Sun. As the head of the Sun family, Mr. Boss Sun still maintains his character even when he is hit by a trap.</p>

    <p>He pulled off the sky ax from his shoulder. At the same time, a fiery red spiritual power was released from his body. In an instant, the injuries caused by the sky ax were rapidly healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"One wrong option has been eliminated. This time. There will definitely be no problem!"</p>

    <p>Obviously. He is confident in his options.</p>

    <p>This time, Boss Sun took the lead in exploring the cave.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling waited another minute.</p>

    <p>Then I saw Sun Yiyuan walking out of the cave with a shiny golden sword on his head and his head covered in blood...</p>
