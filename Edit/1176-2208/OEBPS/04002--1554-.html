  <h1>Chapter 1554 Your circle is in chaos</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhai Yin was actually not that angry at first.</p>

    <p>But the man in front of her didn't understand the charm. He actually said such words before entering the wooden house. In an instant, the depression in her heart reached a peak.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming blurted out the words "If you think so, I can't help it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Jisaki, Sun Rong all felt the same way. The surrounding air temperature dropped several points.</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked like he was watching a show. At the same time, he also wrote to Wang Ling a popular science book: "Houlang Sang. We absolutely cannot say this. The top ten famous sayings that girls hate most from boys. This sentence ranks third! "</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was just wondering which two sentences ranked first and second.</p>

    <p>Just listen to Jisaki and continue to say: "The first is: I'm wrong, okay. The second is: haven't I told you before."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest. Wang Ling doesn't really know where the specific rankings were calculated.</p>

    <p>But just listening to these words does make people feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... having a partner is the most troublesome thing.</p>

    <p>In high school, it is indeed more important to study hard.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never wanted to have a fancy relationship. He is content with his current situation.</p>

    <p>Although it was slightly different from his ideal peaceful life, at least it was not as big a problem as he imagined.</p>

    <p>Men and women in love seem to Wang Ling to be asking for trouble. Why bother?</p>

    <p>Just being alone like that. It's actually pretty good.</p>

    <p>At least at this stage. Wang Ling can be said to have no ideas in this regard.</p>

    <p>In the same way, he felt that with his personality, maybe it wouldn't happen in a few years... or even ten years.</p>

    <p>Why do you need a girlfriend?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is puzzled.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, this is a form of bondage.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is impossible to find it.</p>

    <p>Even if heWang Ling is alone all his life and starves to death, he jumps from here...</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, what magic weapon did Houlang Sang bring this time?"</p>

    <p>As thoughts were swirling in his mind, Jisaki's words broke the dead silence again.</p>

    <p>He's a smart guy. He's going to lighten the mood a little bit.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the current situation is too tense.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Zhai Yin were quarreling. Even a blind man knew they had something going on here.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was the first to reveal the magic weapon he brought. It was a completely blue gemstone. It lay so quietly in the palm of Sun Rong's hand. It exuded an aura of the sea.</p>

    <p>Jisaki's eyes were astonished. He looked over and found that there was the sound of rolling waves in this round gem.</p>

    <p>"Could this be... Dragon Ball?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki began to use his unique imagination as a Sun Islander.</p>

    <p>"This is the magic ball of the sea. It is a magic weapon made from precious crystals from the deep sea and smelted from precious herbs. Wearing it on the body can delay aging and maintain vitality. It can also assist sleep and rest at night."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "If you can't memorize it, just put it in your mouth and recite what you see silently. It will have the same effect as memorizing bread."</p>

    <p>"Awesome!" Jisaki praised.</p>

    <p>Because he knows that Sun Rong is playing Jiugong Liangzi. In order to ensure that he does not leak anything, Jisaki will avoid using prefixes such as "Rong Jiang" or "Liangzi Jiang."</p>

    <p>Nowadays, there are many people with mixed eyes. If he accidentally says something wrong, it will all be revealed.</p>

    <p>"Sea Kingdom Magic Sphere" was originally the treasure in the hands of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, now for a girl who has seen the big world, the value of this magic weapon is not that high.</p>

    <p>The current role of this sea country magic ball may not be as good as the White Rabbit toffee given to her by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But showing it off in this kind of situation is definitely enough to shock and frighten these high school students.</p>

    <p>For students who are still studying.</p>

    <p>This "Sea Kingdom Magic Ball" is an artifact of learning.</p>

    <p>An immortal magic weapon. If you put it in a pile of students, it will be robbed...</p>

    <p>However, in the eyes of Wang Ling, these things are just toys.</p>

    <p>Some may not even be called toys.</p>

    <p>Even if it's a sacred weapon, so what if it's an anti-realm weapon...</p>

    <p>Those are all things that Wang Ling can fabricate at will.</p>

    <p>"So. What treasure did Houlang Sang bring this time?" At this time, Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>The moment he spoke, Wang Ling was still in a daze.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that there is really not much difference between the current Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi. From appearance to sound, they are the same...</p>

    <p>Even the breasts have been further optimized and become very flatter.</p>

    <p>Just on this point, the similarity with Jiugong Liangzi has reached 99.99%!</p>

    <p>He casually put his hands into his pockets.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is fumbling with what he brought.</p>

    <p>Originally, he planned to bring Jingke over.</p>

    <p>But later. Wang Ling found something more low-key than Jingke.</p>

    <p>This is a Peach wood branch brought from a peach forest in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>It is the origin of Jingke...</p>

    <p>It is also a consumable material that can be used to repair Jingke once it is worn.</p>

    <p>Jisaki thought Wang Ling was joking.</p>

    <p>But when he looked carefully.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. He actually fell into a brief trance...</p>

    <p>"What the hell is this..."</p>

    <p>Jisaki felt that all his energy was attracted by this small Peach wood branch.</p>

    <p>Although I can't tell exactly why.</p>

    <p>But Jisaki can feel a special spirituality emanating from this Peach wood branch...</p>

    <p>The spiritual energy gently flowing out from the Peach wood branch is like the hand of an immortal woman. It gently touches Jisaki's heart. It seems to be able to completely calm down people's thoughts. It has a strange power that lasts forever.</p>

    <p>That is the moment Wang Ling took out the Peach wood branch.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere around him suddenly seemed to relax a lot.</p>

    <p>Jingke told Wang Ling previously that the spiritual energy and breath emitted by this Peach wood branch will make people feel peaceful and calm their emotions.</p>

    <p>And it also has the effect of "I examine myself three times a day."</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling has experienced it personally. I finally know what this means...</p>

    <p>Because of the appearance of Peach wood branch.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming and Zhai Yin began to reflect on themselves.</p>

    <p>They are regretting their impulsive remarks just now.</p>

    <p>Peach wood branch's ability to "think about myself three times a day" is too strong. It exceeded Wang Ling's expectations.</p>

    <p>In less than a few seconds, two people who were in a cold war and seemed unable to reconcile for a while suddenly spoke in unison, facing each other.</p>

    <p>"I have something to say to you!"</p>

    <p>"I have something to say to you!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"You say it first!"</p>

    <p>"You say it first!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jisaki saw this and quickly brought Wang Ling and Sun Rong to the foot of the wooden house ahead.</p>

    <p>At this time, he decided that it would be better to leave the two of them alone.</p>

    <p>And it was at this time that Wang Ling saw Wang Ming and Zhai Yin hugging each other from a distance.</p>

    <p>"It's reconciled! It's great!" Sun Rong was secretly happy.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, this scene happened to be watched by the people from the Rainbow Seven Gang in the tree house.</p>

    <p>"President! Big news! Come and see!" A member of the Zifeng Club screamed at the window.</p>

    <p>"What's all the fuss about."</p>

    <p>Then, Moriyama Kaede, the president of the Purple Maple Club, followed the member's guidance and saw this scene from a distance.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he showed the same emoticon of an old man looking at his mobile phone in the subway: "I remember this Sun Rong... didn't I like that Wang Houlang Sang? Why did he suddenly hugged Wang Xiaoer Sang? Together???"</p>

    <p>"I know the President! They all believe in the Wang! So. We must have made a mistake!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>No matter who Sun Rong likes.</p>

    <p>At this time, Moriyama Kaede was completely confused.</p>

    <p>Your circle is so chaotic...</p>
