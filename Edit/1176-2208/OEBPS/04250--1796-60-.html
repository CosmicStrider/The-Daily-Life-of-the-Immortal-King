  <h1>Chapter 1796 60 High Schools Famous Overseas</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I think Ms. Sun and all the students here should know very well why they chose the Number 60 school."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen stretched out her right hand wearing white lace and covered her mouth slightly. She smiled and said: "In this little half a year, from Shadow Stream, Immortal Mansion and Thuntihan Ha... there have been many organizations. They are all inextricably linked to your Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"To be honest, it doesn't have much to do with us." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"It's useless even if Miss Sun is prevaricating like this. Now Number 60 High School's reputation has already spread overseas, including in Glio City. Elite high school students who want to challenge Number 60 High School across the country are also eager to try."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen smiled and said: "If we hold a variety show challenge among high school students at this time, I believe the ratings will be higher than before! What I want is stimulation. I hope Miss Sun will not have other worries. In addition, in order to let Miss Sun and all the classmates can feel free to stay and participate in the recording of this variety show. I also sent an email application to Number 60 High School in the name of the variety show producer."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, Mrs. Lawen fiddled with the electronic watch in her hand. Soon there was a "buzz" sound. An email was immediately projected into the void.</p>

    <p>"This is...Old Chen's mailbox! It also has Old Chen's school seal on it!"</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone at Number 60 High School was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"As you can see, the principal of your school has agreed to let you stay to record this variety show challenge. He has also applied for a seven-day vacation for you."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, everyone. The recording time for the variety show will not be too long. Seven days is enough for us to complete all the projects. In addition, Principal Chen also made some requests. He hopes that your identity can be concealed. I can also do this."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen smiled brightly: "During the entire variety show recording process, we will equip you with exclusive masks to cover your faces. You only need to wear school uniforms to participate in the show."</p>

    <p>"As for me, it's useless even if I wear a mask, because someone will definitely know my identity." At this time, Sun Rong sighed. At the same time, she also sighed in her heart at the methods of Mrs. Lawen.</p>

    <p>She is the future successor of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Something like this happened again in Glio City. Now the focus of the world is on her.</p>

    <p>Even if she wore a mask to hide her identity, it would be useless, as long as she released the information about the high school, even if she didn't name it, everyone would definitely know that it was her... In Sun Rong's eyes, such an operation is almost no different from reporting her ID number directly.</p>

    <p>No matter what happens to this variety show, as long as she exists, it will definitely guarantee the ratings.</p>

    <p>And these were obviously designed by Mrs. Lawen from the beginning.</p>

    <p>The only consolation for Sun Rong now is that her face is covered during the recording of this variety show. And everyone's attention will be focused on her. It should not affect Wang Ling too much. </p>

    <p>But even so, she still felt vaguely uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>She didn't want to cause trouble to Wang Ling. But now, it seems to be completely contrary to her original intention.</p>

    <p>"It will definitely be embarrassing if we lose." In comparison, Guo Hao and others were not in a very beautiful mood.</p>

    <p>They originally just wanted to travel abroad and relax. But they ended up participating in this variety show challenge out of nowhere.</p>

    <p>The email was personally signed by Principal Chen with the school's official seal. It's impossible not to go now.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that this variety show challenges global attention. If you lose, it will be very embarrassing!</p>

    <p>So. It was just a moment. Everyone felt the pressure coming instantly.</p>

    <p>"You are all going to participate in the competition. What should I do?" At this time, Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>There was a little envy in his eyes.</p>

    <p>The little guy is at the age of curious babies. It is the time to accept and absorb all kinds of new things. Variety show challenges are naturally very attractive to Wang Muyu himself.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, believe me. This show is not fun. Your sister and brothers are under a lot of pressure." Li Youyue said helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Really? It sounds fun." Wang Muyu said.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, little brother. Auntie will arrange a session specifically for you."</p>

    <p>At this time, Mrs. Lawen smiled sinisterly again: "I have also reported this to Principal Chen. This variety show challenge is a six plus one challenge format. Six high school students will lead one elementary school student. The delegation of high school students from Glio City will also select a well-known local elementary school student to participate."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu showed doubts in his eyes: "King-level primary school student? Is he very powerful?"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen: "I have also reported this point to Principal Chen. This time, the variety show challenge is a six plus one challenge. Six high school students with one elementary school student. The high school delegation from the city of Glio will also select one of the local famous king level elementary school students to participate."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "Then the king of the elementary school students in Glio City. Can he blow up the earth with one punch?"</p>

    <p>When Mrs. Lawen heard this, she couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Brother Muyu is really good at joking. He's just a primary school student. How can he have the power to blow up the earth?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "But I can!"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen showed a coaxing expression: "Yes, yes. Auntie knows you can do it! But you don't need to blow up the earth in this competition. You just need to follow the instructions of your brothers and sisters. You are the key to scoring points!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu nodded: "Understood!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Mrs. Lawen looked at everyone: "This is the situation. It seems that everyone has understood it. Then I will give Miss Sun the rules of the variety show challenge later tonight. Then I will invite Sun Miss, just introduce the information in detail."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Sun Rong sighed. She looked at the people at Number 60 High School with some shame: "I got everyone involved this time. It's really troublesome for everyone."</p>

    <p>"Whatever comes, take care of it. Boss Sun doesn't have to be like this. We also borrowed the power of Boss Sun. We're all covering our faces anyway. There's no shame in losing." Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"It really doesn't matter if you lose. Variety shows themselves are entertainment. Funny and continuous viewing are the first priority." Mrs. Lawen said with a smile: "But if you win, there will be an extra surprise! I can give you what you bought today."</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was shocked when he heard it. He immediately looked at Wang Ling: "Then Lingzi is losing a lot of money. He didn't buy anything except noodles."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen: "What's so difficult about that? I can just make a limited pack of golden noodles. Even the pepper noodles are plated with gold powder!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "!!!"</p>
