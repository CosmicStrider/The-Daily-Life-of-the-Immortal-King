  <h1>Chapter 1210 Classmate Wang Ling. As expected of you!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Nan Yixiu's failure was unexpected but reasonable. When they saw the mushroom cloud explode, all the principals in the command center couldn't help but look at the hot man from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>From the beginning, Nan Yixiu had been clearly arranged by Principal Chen of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>"Everyone agreed. Our school's playground canteen has been established with capital injection from the Huaguo Shuilian Group, and construction will start in the near future. So everyone has discounted it. I hope all colleagues who just promised will not break their promises." Principal Chen Fengqingyundan He smiled happily. Although he was despised by the principals around him, he undoubtedly became the biggest winner in the game.</p>

    <p>No Bilian...</p>

    <p>The principals dared not speak out in anger. The most important thing was that Mr. Huang and President Qi were present as witnesses. The Haikou they had boasted had to be fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Since you lost, you might as well be more generous. Otherwise, you will be labeled as a bad person.</p>

    <p>As for the reward that Mr. Huang mentioned earlier, that round thing made many people curious.</p>

    <p>"Do you still remember Mr. Huang's promise?" Principal Chen was also polite.</p>

    <p>"I remember. I still carry that round thing with me."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Under the curious eyes of everyone, Mr. Huang took out a shiny object and threw it to Principal Chen.</p>

    <p>"Coins?"</p>

    <p>"An ancient coin. I found it when I was practicing in the stalactite cave."</p>

    <p>"What's the history?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"I don't know." Mr. Huang shook his head.</p>

    <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

    <p>"Go to Station B. Put a coin in the Immortal King animation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side of the scene, Nan Yixiu walked out of the dust after the explosion. His whole body was covered with disgrace.</p>

    <p>The explosion was just right. The light film triggered by the protective golden light protected him very well. He was not missing any arms or legs.</p>

    <p>It's just that the result is hard for Nan Yixiu to accept. He can't imagine that he lost to a mascot like this.</p>

    <p>Obviously...</p>

    <p>He didn't even take a single move against Wang Ling. Did he fail like this?</p>

    <p>At this point, Number 60 High School's championship seems to have settled.</p>

    <p>Now in the field. Number 60 High School also has Guo Hao, Wang Ling, and Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>On the other side, only Tang Jingze from Number 59 High School was left.</p>

    <p>Unless Tang Jingze can complete the counterattack and achieve one versus three, Number 60 High School's championship is already a sure thing.</p>

    <p>One versus three. How easy is this?</p>

    <p>Even if he could win a battle, the physical exertion of a wheel battle would be unbearable for Tang Jingze.</p>

    <p>Just when Guo Hao was warming up and preparing to face off against Tang Jingze, he heard Tang Jingze say: "Well, I admit defeat. Number 60 High School won this game."</p>

    <p>It was now a meaningless battle. Tang Jingze felt that even if he defeated it, he might not be able to win. It was better to save some strength and pick up the second place.</p>

    <p>This decision may seem timid, but in fact it is a wise move. The main reason is that the situation in the Number 59 High School is also quite tragic. As the captain, Tang Jingze. If he is injured again at this time, all the members of the Number 59 High School participating in the battle will Everyone had to be carried back.</p>

    <p>"You want to give up?" Guo Hao couldn't believe that Tang Jingze had made such a decision.</p>

    <p>"This is my decision. And in fact, even if I win the next three games, the overall points may not be higher than Number 60 High School. Otherwise, I will definitely give it a try." Tang Jingze's voice was heavy. How could he? I don't want to finish the last game. But the situation in front of me is that sooner or later, they will lose. Their overall points of Number 59 High School are not high. Even if they win three games, there is still a gap between them and Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The nature of the national competition is essentially a points system. The person who survives to the end will get extra points, but is not necessarily the winner. If the comprehensive points in the previous few days are high enough, it is still possible to turn defeat into victory.</p>

    <p>"How do you know that the overall points are not as good as ours?" Guo Hao was shocked.</p>

    <p>"I caught a patrolling special forces teacher before and asked about the situation of each team." Tang Jingze said while sighing: "Your Number 60 High School has very high points.</p>

    <p>The bonus points for essay alone are around 300... "Extra points for essay?" Guo Hao was shocked.</p>

    <p>"It's the diary of the physical arts competition. Everyone can decide whether to write an essay with a self-made topic. The essay called Wang Ling by classmate Wang Ling added more than 200 points." Tang Jingze finished. Everyone in the audience was shocked. Including Wang Ling. Including the principals present in the command center. They all showed incredulous looks.</p>

    <p>Wipe?</p>

    <p>An essay adds more than 200 points! What a joke!</p>

    <p>The main reason why Wang Ling was surprised was because.</p>

    <p>This composition was not written by him at all!</p>

    <p>During this period of writing, he and Wang Ying were fighting.</p>

    <p>So this composition was ghostwritten by his doppelg√§nger Crispy Noodles...</p>

    <p>Although I knew that Crispy Noodles was an honest person early on, Wang Ling never expected that Crispy Noodles could actually write an essay that earned more than 200 extra points...</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>He felt that more and more eyes were focused on him. Cold sweat instantly moistened his backpack.</p>

    <p>So Tang Jingze was the only one left to sigh. As a new fan of Wang Ling, his admiration for Wang Ling was even greater at this moment than before he came to participate in the competition.</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze: "Classmate Wang Ling. As expected of you! You can even get first place in any composition!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, many principals in the command center quit.</p>

    <p>An essay adds more than 200 points?</p>

    <p>What kind of composition can have such great appeal?</p>

    <p>"The shady story! Chi Guoguo's shady story!"</p>

    <p>"We strongly urge that this piece of composition be made public for everyone to appreciate together!"</p>

    <p>Many principals openly protested.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please be patient. I have ordered the compositions to be retrieved. The compositions written by all students during the competition were all cross-selected and scored by Chinese language gold medal teachers selected from the national outstanding teacher talent pool. Teachers are randomly selected by the system. Logically speaking, they do not exist. There will be shady situations." President Qi said.</p>

    <p>Tens of seconds later. The background library. The {substitute} written by Crispy Noodles instead of Wang Ling was publicly displayed on the screen...</p>

    <p>What came into view was the large number of wavy underlines that the Chinese teacher helped annotate. The principals were shocked. The entire composition was actually filled with golden sentences!</p>

    <p>"A Grain of Ash in Time. Falling on an individual's head. It's a mountain."</p>

    <p>"Nature's obvious warnings are deafening. But we pretend to be deaf and dumb and go with the flow. Or even add fuel to the fire..."</p>

    <p>"We think we dominate the world and can be the masters of our own affairs. But we don't know who has become the substitute for whom."</p>

    <p>"Winter cannot be sung as the beginning of spring. Some people have already been buried in winter. Others should be buried in winter."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Seeing this, all the principals were dumbfounded. They were shocked by Wang Ling's excellent writing and the profound philosophical connotation in its words.</p>

    <p>Although some people don't know the deep meaning expressed in it, it looks and feels very powerful!</p>
