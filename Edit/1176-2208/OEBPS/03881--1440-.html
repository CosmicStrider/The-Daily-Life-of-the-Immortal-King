  <h1>Chapter 1440 Tips for defeating Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong put his hand on Wang Ling's shoulder. Because he knew Wang Ling so well, he was afraid that he might speak in the middle of his sentence and let Wang Ling take advantage of it and run away.</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong mustered up the courage and chose to be tough.</p>

    <p>And this result directly caused the two people to become very close.</p>

    <p>If there is a wall behind you and you stretch your hand back a little further, it will look like you are banging against the wall Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl's mind was racing with thoughts and her cheeks were red.</p>

    <p>He quickly let go of his hand and hid it behind his back.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I just went to collect some folk stories. It wasn't just the two of us. I also made an appointment with Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Li Youyue..."</p>

    <p>She was too afraid that Wang Ling would reject her, so she chose to take a step back.</p>

    <p>In fact, the main reason is to consider Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It seems like it wouldn't be so awkward if everyone went together.</p>

    <p>And even if it is a group activity, you should still be able to find time for two people to be alone.</p>

    <p>As for why Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Li Youyue were chosen, this was certainly within the scope of Sun Rong's consideration.</p>

    <p>These three people look like light bulbs. But they still have good eyesight.</p>

    <p>The time to wait for Wang Ling's reply seems very long.</p>

    <p>More than ten seconds. It is not an exaggeration to say that a day seems like a year.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, I really want to read the girl's mind. To see what the girl sees in her inner world.</p>

    <p>But later I felt that this behavior was a bit like a voyeur and very inappropriate, so I gave up the idea.</p>

    <p>He looked at the girl intently. After hearing Sun Rong's request, he was thinking about how to refuse.</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity. Now Sun Rong knows too much about him.</p>

    <p>Ordinary reasons. For example, he didn't finish his homework, was invited by someone else, or was sick... these things could never happen to him.</p>

    <p>He was silent. Wang Ling heard Sun Rong mention Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Li Youyue again.</p>

    <p>My heart suddenly felt a lot more relaxed.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Sun Rong made this move very successfully.</p>

    <p>Accurately predicted Wang Ling's thoughts.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, it is indeed easier to accept if they are all acquaintances.</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling looked at the expectant girl in front of him and nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>There is only one Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street in Songhai City. And on that ancient street, there is also a time-honored dry noodle shop.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it would be nice to go there once in a while.</p>

    <p>I actually agreed!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong raised his head with a surprised expression on his face.</p>

    <p>She found that she seemed to have gradually discovered some ways to guide Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When dealing with wood like this, doing it too hastily will only lead to bad things... You really have to do it little by little!</p>

    <p>She suppressed the ecstasy in her heart and tried not to make herself too obvious: "That classmate Wang Ling. Let's meet at the school gate on the weekend! Let's form a group and go together!"</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling looked at Sun Rong. The expression on his face also seemed a little helpless.</p>

    <p>{Hexintong} is a passive skill.</p>

    <p>Although the small nano earplugs developed by Wang Ming have the ability to block the hearing of the heart, if the distance is too close... it is still easy to hear the sound.</p>

    <p>For example, right now. Wang Ling's mind is filled with the girl's "hahahaha" laughter.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was laughing so loudly in my heart...</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because I'm too excited.</p>

    <p>That night. The final Sword Arena final. Sun Rong instantly killed the first-placed Sword Spirit in other categories as soon as he appeared on the stage.</p>

    <p>Although this ending is not unexpected, no one knows why. Why did this human girl end the battle so quickly as if she had been beaten to death?</p>

    <p>The reason is simple.</p>

    <p>Because of going to the ancient street on the weekend. In fact, Sun Rong has not informed Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Li Youyue...</p>

    <p>She is waiting to return to Earth to lay out a battle plan!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he got home that night, Sun Rong found Li Youyue first.</p>

    <p>"What? Let's go to the ancient street together? With Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Wang Ling?" Li Youyue was stunned for a few seconds when she heard Sun Rong's invitation.</p>

    <p>At first she didn't understand why the girl had to bring them three light bulbs.</p>

    <p>But soon, Li Youyue reacted: "I understand! You are afraid that you will be rejected if you ask Wang Ling alone. That's why you called us!"</p>

    <p>"You understand so well..." Sun Rong smiled bitterly: "You obviously don't have a boyfriend. How come you understand so well."</p>

    <p>"It's bad. Just watch a few more romance dramas. You can always figure out the tricks." Li Youyue smiled and said, "Don't worry. I will help Chen Chao and Guo Hao go after this. Create opportunities for you."</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much!" Sun Rong sighed. She regretted that she didn't get to know Li Youyue earlier last semester.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the Jiulongshan National Physical Martial Arts Competition, I would have almost missed this amazing assist!</p>

    <p>Get one!</p>

    <p>Finished contacting Li Youyue. Sun Rong went to contact Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>After waiting for more than ten minutes, no one responded to the message.</p>

    <p>I looked at the time. The current time is: ten o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>According to the habits of two people, this time should be the time point to play games.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now? How about asking tomorrow?" Sun Ying'er was very curious about what Sun Rong would do.</p>

    <p>"No." Sun Rong shook his head.</p>

    <p>The so-called plan cannot keep up with changes. Setting a time early is better than anything else.</p>

    <p>"I remember that the game they played recently was called {Public Promotion Link}?" Sun Rong suddenly thought.</p>

    <p>This is the game that Chen Chao and Guo Hao enjoy playing these days. They secretly hang up the game every day in class. Teacher Pan almost confiscated their phones several times.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong defines it as: a large-scale beautiful girl collection and development game.</p>

    <p>There is no other way...</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong sighed: "I have no choice but to snipe them personally."</p>

    <p>"You don't know which server they are on." Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"You don't need to know. Just get first place in them all." Sun Rong showed a kind look.</p>

    <p>It only took about half an hour.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong won the first place in the entire server out of a total of 68 servers.</p>

    <p>Most of the accounts she asked Jiang Xiaoche to recycle.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Her family, Rongrong, is a perfect person with money abilities...</p>

    <p>And sure enough, after this move, Chen Chao and Guo Hao reacted immediately.</p>

    <p>They saw the three-person group chat created by Sun Rong. Then they sent screenshots of the rankings. They asked the girl for details: "Sun Rong ah... the one ranked first. His name is Gray Cult Leader Is the ID yours?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Sun Rong replied: "You two didn't reply to my messages. I had to go to the game to find you."</p>

    <p>"But there are sixty-eight servers. You won the first place..." Chen Chao and Guo Hao were both shocked.</p>

    <p>"Because I don't know where you are. It would be too troublesome to ask everyone."</p>

    <p>"So, in order for us to accompany you and your daughter to the ancient streets on weekends..."</p>

    <p>"If you agree, this number 68 will belong to you. Half of it for each of you is just right."</p>

    <p>"Ha! Do you think we are people who sell our souls for money? That's right! We are! So, see you this weekend..."</p>

    <p>"Well, actually there is one more thing." At this time, Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. We both understand." Chen Chao chuckled: "It's just creating opportunities. We will definitely follow Boss Sun's deployment. In addition, I also have hotel coupons here. If needed..."</p>

    <p>"No need..." Sun Rong refused immediately.</p>

    <p>She felt that Chen Chao really thought too much. Where did this go!</p>

    <p>And even if you go, you won't need a coupon. Anyway, the hotels in the ancient street are all owned by them.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, the girl was actually a little curious about what would really happen on the weekend.</p>

    <p>After all, Chen Chao's open mouth is a bit scary...</p>
