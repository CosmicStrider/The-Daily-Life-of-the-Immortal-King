  <h1>Chapter 1298 Wang Ling's fish tank</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This fish tank is actually a magical weapon belonging to the monk. It is called: Fishing Law Enforcement Tank.</p>

    <p>It can lock any rivers and seas that the monk has traveled. Let the space inside the fish tank connect with these rivers and seas.</p>

    <p>The size of the space is related to the strength of the fish tank user.</p>

    <p>The monk calculated that the six Dao Gods would hunt down the divine sea in the divine realm. Therefore, he gave such a fish tank to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, the locked area of the fish tank is very limited. It is impossible to cover the entire Shenhai area.</p>

    <p>Even the monk himself cannot do this.</p>

    <p>With his strength, he can only lock one-third of the Divine Sea at most.</p>

    <p>But what the monk never expected was...</p>

    <p>This fish tank is under Wang Ling's hand. The space of the fish tank directly fills the entire Divine Sea.</p>

    <p>There are even large-scale overflows...</p>

    <p>In other words. It's not just the Divine Sea.</p>

    <p>This entire divine domain is under the control of Wang Ling. It is only the size of a goldfish bowl.</p>

    <p>But there is one thing to say. The design of a magical weapon like a fish tank. Wang Ling thinks only a monk can think of it...</p>

    <p>He suddenly received a lot of inspiration from the monk.</p>

    <p>This monk has a lot of experience and a big brain. He knows too much weird knowledge.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling considers his combat power to be superior to that of a monk. But in some other aspects, this monk does have something worth learning from.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" Er Ha asked, looking at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It can clearly feel the six small stones caught between Wang Ling's fingers. It is shivering...</p>

    <p>Previously, the six Dao Gods had been clamoring about the question "What is God?"</p>

    <p>Now. The answer is obvious.</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>The six small stones in Wang Ling's fingers were crushed into pieces...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. At a depth of 5,000 meters in the Divine Sea.</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru looked up at the six Dao Gods who were quickly caught by giant hands and turned into ashes on the sea level. He fell into deep thought for a long time.</p>

    <p>This is obviously not the monk's hand.</p>

    <p>Previously when the monk was fighting against the Seven Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>That extraterrestrial hand that pierced the brain of Dao God, the head of the Zhou family, left a deep impression on him.</p>

    <p>"Is it that senior from Earth again..." Liu Chengru felt that this could no longer be described as "strong."</p>

    <p>He rummaged through his mind and found that he couldn't come up with the exact adjective for the moment.</p>

    <p>The six Dao Gods had no power to resist at all.</p>

    <p>Under the hands of these aliens, they were neatly snatched out of the deep sea. They were crushed to pieces on the spot in an instant. Their flesh and blood were blurred. Then they were turned into fly ash...</p>

    <p>He didn't even hear the cry of the Six Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru saw everything in his eyes and was shocked in his heart.</p>

    <p>He jumped out of the sea level. He felt that the breath of the six Dao Gods had completely disappeared...</p>

    <p>"Is this the fall?" Liu Chengru felt a little numb.</p>

    <p>Crush six Dao Gods to death at once. What kind of existence is this...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a dark world, the souls of the six Dao Gods appeared here.</p>

    <p>This is a world covered in dark purple glow. There is low pressure everywhere, which makes people feel mentally depressed.</p>

    <p>"We are really dead..."</p>

    <p>The faces of the six Dao Gods were pale, their hearts were throbbing, and their wandering souls were trembling.</p>

    <p>They know very well what kind of place this is...</p>

    <p>This is a place abandoned by God!</p>

    <p>--It is rumored that the Dao God is an unknown world that can only be entered after death.</p>

    <p>In this world, Heavenly Dao's seductive soul, the Golden Men, cannot be locked to their location. In other words, their souls at this moment will temporarily escape the jurisdiction of the death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Being able to come to this world is one of the privileges that only God has.</p>

    <p>Here they can sacrifice their own cultivation to pay for their own lives.</p>

    <p>However, they had no idea what had just happened...</p>

    <p>Everything happened too suddenly.</p>

    <p>"Then what is the origin of the seniors on earth..."</p>

    <p>The Six Dao Gods never thought that they would be killed instantly.</p>

    <p>Entering directly, "Is this the first time for everyone to come to this god-forsaken land?" The head of the Li family was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Hey. We should listen to more advice... The Wang family, the Gu family, and the Liu family. The disciples of those three families are all on Earth. And they must be related to the senior on Earth... No matter which family we attack. It's all for free."</p>

    <p>"It's too late to regret it!" Hearing this, the heads of other families also sighed.</p>

    <p>Now it's too late for them to regret.</p>

    <p>In fact, if they think about it carefully, they feel that if they had been calmer before, they would not have encountered such a thing...</p>

    <p>The patriarch of the Liu family, Liu Chengru, is just a Dao Supreme. Why would he dare to argue with their six Dao Gods?</p>

    <p>If he didn't have that life-saving golden talisman as his trump card, how could he have such confidence?</p>

    <p>"The head of the Sheng family. It seems that you were the one who instigated this matter from the very beginning." At this time, the heads of the other five families focused their attention on the soul of the head of the Sheng family.</p>

    <p>Their eyes were filled with anger and they were trembling with anger.</p>

    <p>"Please calm down... I didn't expect things to turn out like this..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Sheng family couldn't resist the public anger, so he had to give in: "I think we should discuss it first. How should we go back?"</p>

    <p>"How else can I go back?"</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>His gaze pointed to a simple black altar in front of him.</p>

    <p>The entire altar is square. It is engraved with obscure ancient Taoist patterns, exuding a magical atmosphere.</p>

    <p>"Did you see it? This should be the altar of the abandoned place recorded in ancient books." said the head of the Li family.</p>

    <p>Based on his knowledge, he told the method of resurrection: "In the middle of the altar is the Pillar of God's Abandonment. Touch it and sacrifice your own cultivation. Then you can go back."</p>

    <p>"Sacrificing to cultivate one's strength... how many sacrifices do we have to make..." several masters asked one after another.</p>

    <p>"According to ancient records, everyone's situation is different. It needs to be comprehensively evaluated based on the cause of death and all aspects of the matter. I heard that if you reflect in your heart, you can greatly reduce the loss of your cultivation. If you have no regrets, then... I can only sacrifice most of my cultivation..."</p>

    <p>When the head of the Li family said this, the other five gods all understood.</p>

    <p>The cause of death. Needless to say, they all died at the hands of those outside that day... and they were killed on the spot. They didn't even feel much pain. They were already dead.</p>

    <p>This is a destructive and overwhelming force. The six Dao Gods still tremble when looking back to this day.</p>

    <p>As for repentance...</p>

    <p>At this time, they couldn't help but think of what Liu Chengru said to them when he summoned the golden talisman before his death.</p>

    <p>"Now it seems that what the elder of the Liu family said is not unreasonable..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Dao Ancestor of the Wu family sighed: "The six of us, we call ourselves gods, but just now we were crushed to death like ants by the senior on Earth..."</p>

    <p>After the head of the Wu family finished speaking, tears were rolling in the corners of his eyes. He looked really regretful.</p>

    <p>It seems like nothing from the class is like this. Painful too.</p>

    <p>Then, he took a step forward and took the initiative to reach out and touch the Pillar of God's Abandonment: "Everyone, I'll go first... I hope my confession can move the Pillar of God's Abandonment..."</p>

    <p>About ten seconds passed. The Pillar of Divine Abandonment began to tremble slightly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a disembodied voice sounded.</p>

    <p>"If you are punished for 100 lifetimes of cultivation, you can return to the world..."</p>

    <p>This is the sound made by the pillar spirit of the Pillar of God's Abandonment.</p>

    <p>"100 lives..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Wu family was shocked. He expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict: "I have obviously repented!"</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling was angry: "Shut up! You are an actor..."</p>
