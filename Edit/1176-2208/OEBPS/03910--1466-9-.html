  <h1>Chapter 1466 Jiugong Liangzi's Great Crisis!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a panic, Jiugong Liangzi was pulled out on the spot by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She was a little frightened by Zhuo Yi's performance.</p>

    <p>Since my first face-to-face contact with Zhuo Yi in the principal's office of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi knows it. He is a calm old liar.</p>

    <p>Including now. The old liar's face and pulse still haven't fluctuated at all.</p>

    <p>She didn't know how Zhuo Yi managed to remain calm.</p>

    <p>If you think about it carefully, it seems that it is not difficult to hide things like heartbeat, pulse, and expression with some technical means.</p>

    <p>At least for now. Zhuo Yi told Jiugong Liangzi with sweat in his palms.</p>

    <p>This time the "old liar" seems to be honest.</p>

    <p>"You're pinching me. Can you please relax a little..." Jiugong Liangzi was dragged a long way by Zhuo Yi. He muttered softly behind Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi This is the first time I heard Jiugong, who has always been strong, show such a coquettish voice.</p>

    <p>"Is this a request?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>"Huh. I'm just forced to cooperate."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hummed: "My hands have been stained by you. I don't know how much hand sanitizer I have to waste to wash away the filth of you, an old liar."</p>

    <p>The word "old liar" is Jiugong Liangzi's "honorific title" for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi After listening to it, I actually didn't feel much in my heart.</p>

    <p>I didn't even feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Because what Jiugong Liangzi said is indeed true.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. The situation was urgent just now. I didn't have time to explain to you more."</p>

    <p>He loosened the grip in his hand and pulled Jiugong Liangzi forward. The two stood side by side and looked like a couple.</p>

    <p>Many people on the ancient street cast their eyes in their direction. Some people seemed to be talking about them.</p>

    <p>This is so shameful...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi lowered his cloak a little.</p>

    <p>She never dreamed that she and the old liar beside her would be misunderstood.</p>

    <p>What a shame!</p>

    <p>"Where are you taking me?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>"Let's go to an open area first. I remember there is a Taoist temple in front of us." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Why go there?"</p>

    <p>"There are many people on the street. Even if they follow you all the way, I'm afraid they won't be able to find a good opportunity to make a move. Choosing an open place will make it easier to lure the wolf into a trap."</p>

    <p>The Taoist temple on the ancient street is a famous holy place for blessings.</p>

    <p>However, the opening hours of the Taoist temple are in the afternoon. So this time can ensure that no other people will enter there.</p>

    <p>The owner of the Taoist temple is also friends with Zhuo Yi. Before Zhuo Yi came here, he had basically said hello to all his friends.</p>

    <p>"Are you so sure that these Jiugong family members are not good for me?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>"100%"Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>After all, this is the judgment of his master Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"So. How many people know about your coming here?"</p>

    <p>One of Jiugong Liangzi's hands was held by Zhuo Yi. The other hand was holding his chin and thinking: "Except for my female bodyguard, no outsiders should know... Oh, by the way. Also. There's Doctor Dahe!"</p>

    <p>"Doctor Dahe?"</p>

    <p>"Call Mucun Dahe."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "This is my personal doctor. He diagnosed me because I was addicted to hallucinogens. He overheard that I was going to the ancient street."</p>

    <p>"eh..." Zhuo Yi nodded thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>This Mucun Dahe seems to be very suspicious.</p>

    <p>But now he has no direct evidence.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiugong Liangzi felt a little unhappy when he heard Zhuo Yi's inquiry: "Your tone makes it seem like there is a mole in our Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>"Isn't it?" Zhuo Yi asked back.</p>

    <p>"you..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi hummed again: "The people I brought out this time are all carefully selected. They will not betray me so easily! Do you think everyone is an old liar like you!"</p>

    <p>"Is there any betrayal? We'll find out later."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled. He did not continue to argue with the girl.</p>

    <p>Because facts speak louder than words.</p>

    <p>At this time, within their line of sight, the two of them could already see the ancient gymnasium built on the hillside of the ancient street a few hundred meters away from the slope in front of them.</p>

    <p>"Last question."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi asked: "The female ghost on the TV yesterday. Was she sent by you?"</p>

    <p>"Ah Zhen" was discovered?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's heart suddenly skipped a beat when he heard Zhuo Yi's question.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect this old liar to have such ability. She immediately sneered: "So what?"</p>

    <p>"You actually sent a female ghost to monitor my life. You don't like me, do you?" Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Who likes you!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed when asked. He didn't know whether he was angry or shy.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels that blushing is reflected in Jiugong Liangzi. In fact, it is not easy to judge.</p>

    <p>Because more often than not, the blushing of this arrogant young lady with a bad temper usually means she is angry.</p>

    <p>"This is surveillance! To collect evidence of your deception!" Jiugong Liangzi repeatedly explained the purpose of sending the female ghost. It was like a cover-up.</p>

    <p>She is like a hedgehog with fried hair. Or a little porcupine.</p>

    <p>Put on a "super fierce" posture.</p>

    <p>But in Zhuo Yi's eyes. I don't know why he feels that Jiugong Liangzi is a bit cute.</p>

    <p>But now is not the time to "tease" the girl.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi could only apologize: "Just kidding. Don't mind. Of course I know that Jiugong is a person who upholds justice and fights counterfeiting."</p>

    <p>"Hmph. That's pretty much it!"</p>

    <p>After saying this, Jiugong Liangzi's mood actually calmed down a lot.</p>

    <p>He was worried that if he kept teasing her, the girl would really get mad. This would be detrimental to the situation at hand.</p>

    <p>The two of them walked to the door of the Taoist temple. The door of the Taoist temple was actually open. Because they had said hello in advance, the temple owner did not insert the bolt.</p>

    <p>According to the plan started by Zhuo Yi, he planned to go to the gym to pray and express his love to the old locust tree covered with red ribbons.</p>

    <p>Even the words written on the red ribbon were thought out in advance.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan. Zhuo Yi knew that Jiugong Liangzi would follow him all the way.</p>

    <p>So you will definitely see the words "Jiugong Liangzi I like you" written on the red ribbon.</p>

    <p>Then he just needs to hide quietly and wait for the hidden camera prepared in advance to record the girl's reaction.</p>

    <p>But now, the plan can't keep up with the changes.</p>

    <p>His wish failed.</p>

    <p>Anyway, as long as Jiugong Liangzi is still at Number 60 High School, he will have a lot of time to tease this girl.</p>

    <p>There is no rush anymore.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Outside the Taoist Temple. After seeing Zhuo Yi leading Jiugong Liangzi inside.</p>

    <p>The followers of the Jiugong family were all shocked and inexplicable.</p>

    <p>Because this Taoist temple is famous for couples praying...</p>

    <p>"When did the relationship between the eldest lady and this boy reach this point?"</p>

    <p>These Jiugong family members are puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Forget it. No matter how far this Zhuo Yi develops, he has nothing to do with it. The mission we received is to make her disappear."</p>

    <p>"What about this Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't I tell you that he is a liar? He has no real ability. With the strength of the three of us, it is more than enough to kill two of them."</p>

    <p>The leading man sneered. He wore a black earring. He was the commander of this operation: "After killing them all, put their bodies together. It is best to put them in a hugging position. This way As a result, the reputation of Miss Liangzi's line in the family will also be completely destroyed..."</p>
