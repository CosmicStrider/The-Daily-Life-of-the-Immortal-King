  <h1>Chapter 2054 A bad fate that started from eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Mr. Gray Mist said it righteously. This sense of deja vu, as if if I don't take it with me and keep it, it will expire, it's exactly the same as Zhang Zhui back then.</p>

    <p>Although it is a mythical beast, it seems that the food-hoarding gene that is the instinct of rats has been preserved in this stupid prairie dog.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has no interest in this prairie dog. However, its arrival did give Wang Ling some new revelations.</p>

    <p>For example, the original place where the Sun family's ancestral land was built was not in the belly of the whale. This is new information. And it is something that even the Boss Sun does not know.</p>

    <p>In other words, the actual construction time of this ancestral land is indeed as Wang Ling initially inferred. It is very likely that it has been built in the eons of time. It is just that perhaps the complete ancestral land world as it is today has not been opened up at that time.</p>

    <p>"I'm curious. You are also an eternal creature. So do you know him?" Wang Ying asked directly. He projected the aura image of the ancient tripod in the core world and asked.</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>The woodchuck stared at the projected image carefully. Not that carefully. But he still immediately recognized the young man in the ancient cauldron who was beaten until his nose was black and his face was swollen and even his own mother could not recognize him.</p>

    <p>"Good guy. Isn't this the little brat from the Deci family..." it exclaimed immediately. And the words were shocking, which surprised everyone present.</p>

    <p>Although this groundhog is very stupid, after all, it was also the divine beast under Dao Ancestor Wang. Throughout the entire history of the cultivation world, its seniority is indeed very high. It was even higher than many ancients. Even Zhang Zhui and Li Xian were present. I'm afraid I have to call it "Senior."</p>

    <p>Although this mortal man was famous in ancient times and was a well-known genius. Many people recognized him, but in the eyes of the groundhog, he was just a junior after all.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you are familiar with him?" Wang Ying raised his eyebrows and asked.</p>

    <p>"Haha. Isn't he just a brat who was showing off his power through foreign affairs?" Marmot said with disdain.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that as the divine beast under Dao Ancestor Wang's sect, this groundhog is stupid. But it is not that stupid.</p>

    <p>In Gray Mist Lord's memory, listening to Dao Ancestor Wang explain the Heavenly Dao spell is one of the happiest times in his life. Therefore, he has always been very repulsive to the heresy outside of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>If it's the Tao ability that I have comprehended, that's it. But what is this external god?</p>

    <p>It was a large race that symbolized endless darkness and evil at the beginning of the universe. It was more hateful than the monsters and demons! A righteous cultivator. Except for those who majored in Heavenly Dao, this evil Taoist power should not be allowed Mix it in.</p>

    <p>So it was concerned about the inheritance of the Heavenly Dao tradition from the beginning, and was very shameless about it.</p>

    <p>Now that I see Xufeng Nian being beaten up like this, I even feel a little relieved in my heart.</p>

    <p>But it's been such a long time. By virtue of the Heavenly Dao system in his body, this kid's level should have soared to an incredible level... He could still be beaten so badly...</p>

    <p>While feeling relieved, the groundhog was also carefully examining the injuries of Xifengnian. Then he finally couldn't help feeling frightened.</p>

    <p>This little brat has been digesting the foreign tradition for so long. He can still be beaten like this...</p>

    <p>This Wang Ling. is indeed not a normal cultivator!</p>

    <p>Hey. How could it not figure out that it was autistic in the first place? It should hug its legs quickly!</p>

    <p>At this time, perhaps he had come back to his senses. After catching the topic of the decadent harvest year, the groundhog revealed almost everything he knew: "I think it was the one who suppressed him in this ancient cauldron in the first place. It's up to me and Lord Dao Ancestor to bring up the matter."</p>

    <p>"Didn't the founder of the Sun family suppress it?" Sun Ru asked.</p>

    <p>"How could your ancestor have such ability back then? Of course, Mr. Dao Ancestor Wang was behind him to help. However, this ancient tripod does have an extraordinary origin. It is the sequence four-light chaos weapon left in the hands of the old man. The three-legged true dragon tripod."</p>

    <p>The groundhog sighed: "Now it seems that this three-legged true dragon cauldron is no longer as glorious as it used to be. This guy's appearance is too exaggerated. It has destroyed the true dragon cauldron's divinity."</p>

    <p>"Then where did his foreign wife Heavenly Dao come from? Did he find it himself?"</p>

    <p>"I know this." The groundhog nodded. He knew everything and said: "In the eternal period, there were four great emperors under Dao Ancestor Wang. You must have heard about it, right? And there was one discovered in the Eastern Territory back then. The Palace of the Outer Gods."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this. Wang Ling, Wang Ying suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>A few days ago, their souls returned to the Eternal Period. They had indeed personally experienced the experience of the Eternal Period. They even had friendship with the Eastern Emperor for a time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling also knew about the existence of the Palace of the Outer Gods in the Eastern Great Region. However, he did not expect that the Heavenly Dao tradition inherited by the Emperor of the East was actually the same as the Palace of the Outer Gods during the period of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>At this moment, all the events and clues seemed to be connected instantly like beads on a string.</p>

    <p>I dare to fall in love with this evil fate. It actually started from eternity...</p>

    <p>"What else do you want to know? Just ask. As long as I know, I will tell you." said the groundhog. This is already a very clear gesture of goodwill. And it did not stop working while it spoke. He was holding up his paw to measure the tunnel he had dug.</p>

    <p>Given the narrowness of this passage, it would definitely be enough for it to get through on its own. But the person following it now is Wang Ling! Even if someone has a spell to shrink their body, it is impossible for someone to really let someone crawl through a mouse hole. Well.</p>

    <p>That's why the groundhog measures it carefully. In fact, it is to make the hole it digs more beautiful. It can ensure that Wang Ling can walk through it comfortably with its back straight.</p>

    <p>Originally, it was sent here just to make a deal with Monk Jin Deng. But now it has fully understood Monk Jin Deng's intention of sending itself here.</p>

    <p>As long as it can have a good relationship with Wang Ling, it doesn't even need to wait for the monk to help it reshape its body. The foreign tradition that this little brat has digested for so long has been beaten into this virtue. Then Wang Ling Definitely more powerful!</p>

    <p>So, after thinking about all this, the groundhog worked extra hard. While answering Wang Ying's various questions, he did the work at hand without any delay.</p>

    <p>Soon, a very beautiful, neat and clean tunnel came into view.</p>

    <p>"Senior Gray Mist Lord, as long as people can pass through... But you just dug a high-speed rail tunnel. Isn't that a bit exaggerated?" Immortal Toya held his forehead, dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Even if we use manpower to dig such a huge tunnel project, it may take a lot of time.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to digging burrows, this prairie dog is really an expert.</p>

    <p>"Hey. What a big deal. I can dig holes and fill them in. I can still fill them in when I come back later. www.uukanshu.net "</p>

    <p>It smiled while working.</p>

    <p>But in the next second, its claws suddenly retracted as if they were electrocuted.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the tunnel leading to the fifth map was about to be dug, but at this moment, something so hard that even its claws could not dig through suddenly blocked it.</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>The prairie dog thought he had dug up some eternal meteorite. But after examining it carefully, he was surprised to find that the mass was not only hard, but also furry.</p>

    <p>Its expression immediately changed. It immediately turned from calm to a little uneasy: "Impossible...how could it be in this Sun family's ancestral land..."</p>

    <p>The groundhog was convinced that his perception was correct. Especially when the thing he touched made a low groan, he became even more convinced of his judgment.</p>

    <p>This is the second divine beast under Dao Ancestor Wang... an ancient white bear bathed in thunder!</p>
