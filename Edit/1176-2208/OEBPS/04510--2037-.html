  <h1>Chapter 2037: Anti-customer Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The Sun Family's Mountain-Suppressing Knight is not just the one that dealt with Mingyue Ye before. It seems that the restrictions that can trigger the Mountain-Suppressing Knight are based on the strength of the "intruder."</p>

    <p>Now, the vast number of knights rushing out of the mountain like a swarm in front of us is the best respect for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This scene gave Immortal Toya a great shock. He had reason to suspect that all the mountain-suppressing knights in the entire Sun family's ancestral land had been activated. The hundreds of mountain-suppressing knights were probably the largest inventory in the entire Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>At this time, they gathered in a dark patch of sky. The oppressive feeling of black clouds looming over the city almost made people so nervous that they couldn't breathe.</p>

    <p>It is easy to destroy these mountain-suppressing knights. But after the scene just now, Wang Ling no longer wants to take action at will. He is afraid that if he does it, the holes in the Ice Purgatory have not been repaired. There will be several more holes in the Sun family's ancestral land. Come.</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling disappeared in an instant. He turned into a ray of light and rushed directly into the stone door in front of him. He ran as fast as light and electricity, trying to get rid of these mountain knights behind him.</p>

    <p>After passing through the stone gate, I suddenly entered the third map world in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. This is a place that is very similar to an ancient battlefield. The terrain is dangerous and there are densely sealed immortal caves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was running extremely fast, but he still used King's Eyes to see clearly the internal structure of these immortal caves. The ancestor of the Sun family hid part of the Sun family's treasures in these sealed immortal caves.</p>

    <p>But in fact, most of the immortal caves are deliberately arranged traps. It is difficult to detect the authenticity from the appearance. If you make a mistake in judgment and fall into one, it will be like a wild beast falling into a trap. You will escape death.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling traveled at the speed of light. He left behind a large afterimage. Without any reservations, he demonstrated his supreme speed.</p>

    <p>The speed of these mountain knights was far inferior to Wang Ling. However, Wang Ling still couldn't get rid of them smoothly.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that a long distance had been opened. Wang Ling found that the teleportation circles of those mountain-suppressing knights would always appear in the void behind him.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. It seems that the summoning mechanism of this mountain knight is linked to the entire ancestral land. As long as the ancestral land ban is not rewritten, no matter where we are in the ancestral land, they can use the forbidden teleportation ability to rush us in an instant. Come on." Immortal Toya analyzed and said.</p>

    <p>"Hmm."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, he was also very curious about the setting of this restriction. To write such a restriction mechanism, the ability of the ancestor of the Sun family may be stronger than he imagined in Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For those with high power, it is not difficult to arrange the restriction itself. But the area of the Sun family's ancestral land, Shiwandashan, is too vast. It requires such a large amount of work, and it is necessary to write such a sophisticated restriction mechanism. This is not Most people can do it.</p>

    <p>This is like programming. It is not difficult for programmers to write a simple small software. But if you want to program a 3A game masterpiece, the difficulty is not a million points.</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>The current level of sophistication in the ancestral land restriction. Was it written by the founder of the Sun family back then? Or was it rewritten and rewritten by a more powerful person...for example, Dao Ancestor Wang. After the soul was planted? What are the results?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling leaves questions in mind.</p>

    <p>After confirming the operating mechanism of these mountain knights, Wang Ling immediately had a solution in mind.</p>

    <p>He immediately took out a tablet computer.</p>

    <p>"Ep Ed?" Immortal Toya was stunned when he saw this. He remembered that this chatty tablet computer spirit had been sent to other universes by Wang Ling. He didn't expect to see him again now.</p>

    <p>"It's not Apple Aid. It's a domestic Hongmeng tablet." Wang Ying's voice came.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Immortal Toya nodded. He immediately knew that this Hongmeng was the replacement of the previous Aipuaide.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that it is a domestic tablet. Hongmeng is obviously much more obedient than that chatty tablet that likes to show off data.</p>

    <p>In the core world, Immortal Toya saw Wang Ling opening Hongmeng's programming system. A large string of precise green data scrolled on Hongmeng's black screen. It gave a high-tech feel.</p>

    <p>It was not an ordinary numerical code. It was a variety of cultivation runes. Some of the runes were ancient runes. Immortal Toya couldn't understand them at all.</p>

    <p>But he knows that Wang Ling is taking out Hongmeng while flying now. It is modifying the restrictions on the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>After a while, the tracking circle of the Zhenshan Knight subsided. Wang Ling also stopped his fast-moving body.</p>

    <p>He turned back. After confirming that no mountain-suppressing knights were following him through the restricted teleportation circle, he felt relieved.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren is... directly canceling the ban on mountain knights in his ancestral land?" Immortal Toya asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"No." Wang Ying said with a smile: "Cancel the ban on mountain knights in the ancestral land. If there is an invasion by foreign enemies, wouldn't the Sun family's ancestral land be unable to detect it? So, the Lord. Directly set yourself to The owner of the ancestral land."</p>

    <p>"That's alright... As expected of Ling Zhenren." Immortal Toya was shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect such an operation to exist.</p>

    <p>Good guy. He actually turned against the guest.</p>

    <p>The owner of the Sun family's ancestral land...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya suddenly remembered what Boss Sun did when he was pursuing Grandma Sun. He had an inexplicable feeling that there was a sense of déjà vu.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong did not design this time intentionally. Immortal Toya suddenly felt that Wang Ling had tricked himself into it.</p>

    <p>After calming down the guard of the mountain knights, Wang Ling found that he had entered the depths of this ancient battlefield. The area of this place was larger than Wang Ling imagined. Previously, at his speed, Next. He didn't even leap directly out of this ancient battlefield.</p>

    <p>Wrong...</p>

    <p>Maybe there is a travel ban on this battlefield? It has the same effect as a Möbius strip. No matter how it flies, it is actually constantly moving in the same battlefield.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know how many maps there are in the Sun family's ancestral land, Shiwandashan. But from now on, it seems that if you want to enter the fourth map of the ancestral land, you may have to find another way.</p>

    <p>And the secret to entering the fourth map may lie in this ancient battlefield.</p>

    <p>"Um?"</p>

    <p>At this time, he frowned and felt the presence of living beings in the battlefield. It was a feeling as if he had been sleeping for a long time and was reviving.</p>

    <p>"I heard that in ancient times. In order to protect the order of cultivators, the Sun family repeatedly sent family members to the battlefields of the immortal world to mediate and maintain peace. Countless young geniuses of the Sun family sacrificed themselves on the battlefield. Precious life."</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya said. He put forward his own thoughts and doubts: "Is it possible that some of these young geniuses are not dead? Ling Zhenren directly resurrected the genius because he modified the restriction and injected spiritual power? But this is not the case. That's right. From ancient times to modern times. This timeline spans too long!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling landed on the ancient battlefield. He stared at a tombstone less than three feet away from him in front of him. The inscription on it had been completely obliterated. The handwriting could not be read clearly.</p>

    <p>The breath of life he felt in the void before was transmitted from under the tombstone.</p>

    <p>Soon. The earth around the tombstone loosened. A flawless white hand broke out of the earth...</p>

    <p>"It's actually a woman?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying chuckled. He felt that things were getting interesting.</p>
