  <h1>Chapter 1670 The only way to avoid Wang Ling's slap</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the rabbit numbered 096 showed a moved expression with tearful eyes. Wang Nuan also said that the white and soft hair on the rabbit's body crawled all the way to its shoulders. He pulled it with his small hands like a rein. 096 rabbit ears.</p>

    <p>This pulling sensation did not make 096 feel the slightest pain. Instead, it felt very comfortable.</p>

    <p>It has been waiting for four billion years. It has been searching for the value and meaning of its existence... Even though it has never met Wang Nuan, the ability to resonate as the Lord of Shadow is not fake.</p>

    <p>This made 096 quickly realize that the baby sitting on its shoulders and tugging on its ears was the master it had been looking for, and the whole meaning of living in this world.</p>

    <p>So, at this moment, 096, who had never shown a smile before, had been silent in sadness, suddenly confidently showed his buck teeth, showing an unprecedented smile.</p>

    <p>In the astrology club, when Xiang Yi saw this scene, he was in a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>That's not right...</p>

    <p>Aren't these sheltered creatures supposed to be ferocious and inhumane monsters? Why are they smiling like they saw Ku Xuan's tenth update today?</p>

    <p>There is obviously something wrong with this style of painting!</p>

    <p>It can only be said that she is indeed Ling Zhenren's sister. With the same blood connection, things can always happen beyond normal understanding.</p>

    <p>So Xiang Yi soon began to feel relieved. He felt that he was a little strange.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "So. This 096 is from the [Dao Sect]? Is it a Shadow derivative?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was ashamed: "It looks like that's right... The aura of this rabbit is very strong. I didn't expect it to be one of our own."</p>

    <p>This result is also beyond Wang Ling's expectations. The seeds sown four billion years ago are now being recycled... This shows the wait after all the changes in the world. It is actually a little touching to taste it carefully. People can't help but shed tears on this chapter.</p>

    <p>He saw Ah Nuan playing with the rabbit ears and looked very happy. His heart softened immediately. Although the rabbit crushed his canteen and interrupted his plan to buy snacks.</p>

    <p>But as long as Ah Nuan girl likes it, it's like picking up a gold medal to avoid death.</p>

    <p>After all, she is my sister. And she is still my biological sister.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling What can I do? My sister likes her. Of course he can only pamper her.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>If one day Wang Nuan loses interest in 096, 096's life safety cannot be guaranteed... Maybe it will be directly made into spicy rabbit head...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can be seen that 096 is very strong. Although he has lived for four billion years, in fact, a considerable part of this time was spent in a containment device.</p>

    <p>In other words, the meat quality is not as old as it looks, and the taste is not bad when cooked.</p>

    <p>And just when Wang Ling was thinking about whether to make 096 into a dish in the future. Should it be braised, steamed or spicy. 096, who was originally held by Ah Nuan with two rabbit ears, was very well-behaved. Suddenly, the face His eyes turned fiercely in one direction, exuding an extremely hostile look.</p>

    <p>"Is there another one..." Wang Ling muttered in his heart.</p>

    <p>Because. Accompanied by a huge roar not far away, a new cubic containment container was lowered again.</p>

    <p>096 was making a low warning sound in that direction. At this time, Ah Nuan really searched the soft hair on the top of its head. It felt as if all his bones were softened. 096's body suddenly became weak.</p>

    <p>"Another one?"</p>

    <p>In the astrology club, Er Ha also said vigilantly. He didn't know if it was an illusion. He felt that the creatures contained in this cube seemed to be more ferocious than 096.</p>

    <p>"It looks like it should be 1212." Xiang Yi frowned and said. Among all the sheltered creatures captured by Master Wu Xin, 1212 is obviously a sheltered creature belonging to the younger generation. But because of its special abilities, it cannot be underestimated.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic. It will be okay if you have Senior Jin Deng there." Lord Diulei was calm and composed. So far, the masterminds behind this imperial city have not taken action. Instead, they have taken the lead by releasing this dangerous sheltered creature. This made Lord Diulei feel the danger hidden inside.</p>

    <p>"We cannot blindly adopt a defensive posture. Is there any brother willing to join me. Go directly to the castle and have a look." Lord Diulei said after thinking for a long time.</p>

    <p>"I agree with what Zhenjun said." At this time, Er Ha took the initiative to take a step forward.</p>

    <p>"Then Zenjun and this Elder Toad will go to the castle. Mr. Ming and I will provide long-distance assistance." Xiang Yi said as he stroked the newly assembled Nine Suns Sword.</p>

    <p>"Have you chosen a sniper location?" Wang Ming asked, looking at Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>"No need to select. Just go here."</p>

    <p>"But shouldn't a sniper choose the best angle to shoot from?"</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, this is correct. But I don't use it for my Nine Sun Divine Sword. It can see through and self-aim. And the bullets can also turn."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the location of Ducas's mansion. As a huge cube landed, a humanoid monster with black hair all over its body. Its face could not be seen clearly and it slowly stepped out of your containment device.</p>

    <p>This was almost an instinctive reaction. Zhuo Yi immediately protected Jiugong Liangzi behind him.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to tell the truth to Jiugong Liangzi. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment, danger came again.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. I'm sorry. Let's solve the immediate problems first. I will tell you everything later." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the application on Jiugong Liangzi's face remained calm, but at least it was much calmer than before. Because Zhuo Yi instinctively protected her behind him.</p>

    <p>As far as boyfriend power goes, this is a plus.</p>

    <p>It's just because of his hostility towards Qin Zhong. Jiugong Liangzi's expression still doesn't seem to have changed much.</p>

    <p>Of course, Qin Zhong can actually see that Jiugong Liangzi has misunderstandings about himself. However, this situation is not the time to explain.</p>

    <p>In my head. Wang Ming's voice came almost simultaneously with 1212's landing. Zhuo Yi and the others immediately realized what was happening in front of them.</p>

    <p>"It seems they are here for me." Sun Rong sighed. Judging from the intelligence information shared by Wang Ming, this sheltered creature is obviously not that easy to deal with. It is also a very difficult type.</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the smoke, 1212's huge body outlines a huge fog shadow, permeating with an extremely dangerous atmosphere.</p>

    <p>"Leave it to me Liangzi..." Zhuo Yi gritted his teeth and walked up with the handbag in hand.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, be careful." Qin Zhong warned from the side.</p>

    <p>The result was something that no one expected. I wrote a reminder, but Jiugong Liangzi's reminder exploded.</p>

    <p>Her mood eased a little. And then she got irritated with Qin Zhong. She was so angry that she stomped her feet. She yelled at Qin Zhong: "You... You're a pervert who likes men! I... I 've been putting up with you for a long time!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jiugong Liangzi rushed up, trying to slap Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>"Sister-in-law, calm down...Brother Qin is not what you think..."</p>

    <p>This situation made Zhou Ziyi react quickly. His peacemaker personality made him instinctively want to step forward to stop him. As a result, Jiugong Liangzi's slap happened to hit Zhou Ziyi's back who stepped forward to stop him.</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more.</p>

    <p>Because the effect of Jiugong Liangzi's blessing has not yet ended, the power of this slap is extremely powerful. It actually became a huge boost on the spot.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A firm slap on Zhou Ziyi's back instantly transformed Zhou Ziyi into an advanced humanoid missile!</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>He turned into a beam of light and shot out!</p>

    <p>Shooting out with the indestructible physical strength of a five-piece thermal underwear suit like Michelin tires...</p>

    <p>He crashed into 1212 in the smoke at the front...</p>
