  <h1>Chapter 1640 The strongest armor in the universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The name "Wu Xin" has been a well-known figure throughout the ages. He is a well-known mechanic and has the nickname "Half-formed Warrior." In terms of popularity, he is no less powerful than Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>If I had not been imprisoned by Dao Ancestor Wang unintentionally back then, I am afraid that in the eons of time there would have been black technology that far exceeded modern cultivation civilization.</p>

    <p>But... that timeline has changed after all.</p>

    <p>In the Corpse Map, those eternal warriors imprisoned by Dao Ancestor Wang are all now bones. And the image of Wu Xin is actually very obvious, because no one has gears inside their bones...</p>

    <p>After Zhang Zhui was imprisoned in the Corpse Map, he found that Wu Xin's condition was not very good. As far as his impression was concerned, Wu Xin had always been a relatively open and active person. But after being imprisoned in the map, it became clear that Somewhat autistic.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Wu Xin's ability to withstand pressure was so poor, so Zhang Zhui didn't pay too much attention at that time.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone is as shameless as him.</p>

    <p>But now combined with all the things in front of him, Zhang Zhui became more and more sure of his guess. That is, the Master Wu Xin who was imprisoned in the Corpse Map... was definitely not him.</p>

    <p>Because everyone knew him as "Half-formed Warrior." He was imprisoned in the Corpse Map and turned into a white bone with all kinds of parts. However, these parts have become the biggest cover-up in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>It is said that a leaf blinds the eye. Zhang Zhui didn't realize he'd been set up by an outsider.</p>

    <p>"This half-step magic weapon is quite interesting." Zhang Zhui smiled.</p>

    <p>"But with Dao Ancestor Wang's strength, even if he was deceived at first, he should be able to see it later." Li Xian was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"This old thief Dao Ancestor Wang is always angry. After calming down, he will not pursue it." Zhang Zhui said: "Of course there is another possibility. That is that he left Wu Xin outside. In fact, There is another purpose."</p>

    <p>For a long time, Zhang Zhui still has a grudge against Dao Ancestor Wang who included many powerful people in the Corpse Map just because of a disagreement.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that with Dao Ancestor Wang's level, he would not be so petty at all... And the incident with Old God, Zhang Zhui felt that it was not entirely his fault.</p>

    <p>He does like wives. But he respected the other's wishes. Although he was a womanizer back then. He didn't like to force himself on people.</p>

    <p>If you can't get it, you can't get it.</p>

    <p>That would undoubtedly be an ass-kicking behavior in Zhang Zhui's opinion.</p>

    <p>It is true that he is dissatisfied with Dao Ancestor Wang to this day. However, Dao Ancestor Wang's series of actions made Zhang Zhui have to doubt. Maybe all this is a game...</p>

    <p>Moreover, that man is probably the only one who has the ability to do this.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, using the same psychic tracking method following the traces of the magic circle, Zhang Zhui and Li Xian approached the North Pole.</p>

    <p>After arriving at a certain coordinate point, Li Xian suddenly reached out and pulled Zhang Zhui: "Brother Zi Xiang. Be careful!"</p>

    <p>"I know. There is a virtual realm of Law here." Zhang Zhui stood with his arms folded. Zhang Zhui and Li Xian are floating in the void.</p>

    <p>It's another one of those things that's been passed down through the ages.</p>

    <p>The nature of the Void is actually a mask. It's not as easy to feel for those who are not of the same level. In other words, someone at the North Pole has set up this boundary. They're trying to do something inside.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is very likely that the entire Arctic zone has been transformed. The vast swathes of icebergs, wind and snow, may have long been reduced to nothingness.</p>

    <p>"Go and have a look?" Li Xian said with a frown.</p>

    <p>The space within the void is completely independent and isolated from the outside world. Once the two of them enter, they may not be able to come back if they fall into a trap.</p>

    <p>Li Xian is still hesitating.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a joint mission between him and Zhang Zhui. If he fails because he is too adventurous, some of his points will be deducted. The gain outweighs the loss...</p>

    <p>"I have reported the location to Mr. Zhuo Yi. If the two of us can't get out, he will find another way." It was beyond Li Xian's expectation.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui, who has always been very aggressive in doing things, was extremely cautious at this moment. "Since Brother Zi Xiang said so, let's go in and have a look... Do you think Master Wu Xin is here?"</p>

    <p>"Nine times out of ten," Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>It took them a long time to adapt when they first came to Earth. But the Eternal Powerful Ones were relatively solitary.</p>

    <p>If Master Wu Xin had come to Earth from eternity, he would have chosen this Arctic land a long time ago and taken root there.</p>

    <p>But this is just Zhang Zhui's guess.</p>

    <p>The incident of Liu Renfeng was originally nothing more than a trivial matter in Zhang Zhui's opinion.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this thread was involved in an eternal matter. This made Zhang Zhui's interest instantly doubled.</p>

    <p>There are too many doubts left now. He and Li Xian can only solve them one by one.</p>

    <p>Is that Eternal Brother who set up the formation Master Wu Xin, who is known as the half-step magic weapon? And what is the purpose of Master Wu Xin accepting Liu Renfeng as a disciple...</p>

    <p>These things can only be known after entering this "illusory world of nothingness."</p>

    <p>When Li Xian and Zhang Zhui reached out their hands and touched the barrier of this illusory world, their figures instantly dissipated and submerged in the mist.</p>

    <p>The scene before them shocked Zhang Zhui and Li Xian.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Because what you see in this illusory world is completely different!</p>

    <p>A city built of steel and concrete. Shining with neon lights of all colors. Countless mechanical flying objects hovering in the sky in an orderly manner!</p>

    <p>There is actually another world within this illusory world!</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were both stunned and completely speechless.</p>

    <p>Just because the scene in front of them was too cyberpunk. It was very similar to the online game they watched Wei Zhi play a few days ago.</p>

    <p>They had just arrived in the modern cultivation society. They had not yet fully adapted to the modern cultivation society. But in front of them, this technological city that seemed to be completely built on transcending eras once again made the two of them stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Zhuo Yi received a report from Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>A world of emptiness and illusion?</p>

    <p>Although Zhang Zhui and Li Xian were already taking action, he felt that this was a good opportunity to make a contribution.</p>

    <p>Of course, it's not that he wants to make meritorious deeds. He mainly wants to help Zhou Ziyi</p>

    <p>With his current combat power.</p>

    <p>Of course. Mainly because of the shared ability of one King's Eyes... being able to do whatever you want is not a problem at all.</p>

    <p>"How is it? Are the legs moving easily?" He looked at Zhou Ziyi and asked. Because Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong sent various nutritional supplements, Zhou Ziyi's legs grew very fast.</p>

    <p>"I feel like I can be taller. But there's no problem with normal movements, Brother Zhuo." Zhou Ziyi said.</p>

    <p>"So. Do you want to go out with me to practice?" Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Ah? But the matter of Liu Renfeng has just been solved..."</p>

    <p>"It's not Liu Renfeng's matter. It's another matter." Zhuo Yi said: "And the performance of this task may be related to whether you can become my disciple."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi became excited instantly: "I am willing to go!"</p>

    <p>"Okay. But during the action, you have to stay close to me." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Zhou Ziyi bared his teeth.</p>

    <p>At this moment, this innocent young man didn't know what he was about to see...</p>

    <p>Then Zhuo Yi quickly sent a text message to tell him. He also reported the matter to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The general content is just a copy and pasting of what Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>That is, if he and Zhou Ziyi fail to come out of the "illusory world of nothingness" after a while, they will find a way to rescue them.</p>

    <p>"Done." After confirming that the message was delivered, Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Then, he took out five sets of thermal underwear from the closet and handed them to Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>These are thermal underwear that have been personally inspired by Wang Ling. And they are upgraded versions 3.0. There is no need to shrink your head, hands and feet into thermal underwear. They can also protect the whole body. Previously given by Wang Ling He bought many sets of Zhuo Yi...and today, he dug out all the items at the bottom of the box.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was shocked: "Brother Zhuo. This is..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "It's for your life. Once you put it on, no one will hurt you even if you are separated from me."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was suspicious: "This is just thermal underwear. Is it okay..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "When have I ever lied to you?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "But are we going to go for a long time? Do we need to bring so many changes of clothes?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Who asked you to change? Put them all on for me! It's like a matryoshka doll, you know!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, this innocent boy didn't know his armor value. After putting on five layers of thermal underwear, it had been upgraded to the full level...</p>
