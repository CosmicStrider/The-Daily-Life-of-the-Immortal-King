  <h1>Chapter 1414 60th grade transfer period</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This {Whirlwind Dog Sword} is not something Sun Ying'er just talked about. Instead, there is this sword technique. It is a technique independently created and developed by Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>The advantage is that the attack speed is extremely fast. It is said that the only martial arts in the world is fast. Once the {Whirlwind Dog Sword} is used, the speed of the sword will continue to increase as time goes by.</p>

    <p>If you can practice this sword technique to the state of Dzogchen, you can stab eighty swords in one second!</p>

    <p>And it is also very effective for women to guard against wolves. Because this sword technique specializes in the lower three paths...</p>

    <p>Because at the beginning, Sun Ying'er developed this sword technique to use it against Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>But later Sun Ying'er discovered that not only would her Shadow ability be greatly reduced in front of Wang Ying, but she would also be forced into a disarmed state...</p>

    <p>Snort!</p>

    <p>This damn gorilla!</p>

    <p>However, since all the swordsmanship has been developed, Sun Ying'er feels that it is a pity to waste it like this.</p>

    <p>"How's it going, Rongrong? You want to learn it or not! If you want to learn it, I'll teach you!" Sun Ying'er is very much looking forward to how Sun Rong will perform it in front of everyone after learning it.</p>

    <p>"But you haven't said yet. What are the shortcomings..." Sun Rong hesitated.</p>

    <p>She had no doubt about the lethality and destructive power of this swordsmanship. But the name didn't sound pretty at all. It was too crazy...it didn't suit her quiet and pretty girl style.</p>

    <p>"The shortcomings cannot be said to be big. They cannot be said to be small."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said: "Once you start using this sword technique, you can't stop it. You can't stop until you chop the opponent into pieces. Otherwise, you will go crazy."</p>

    <p>"Chopped..."</p>

    <p>"The Whirlwind Chopping Dog Sword is just like a soymilk machine when it rotates. It attacks the lower three lanes first and beats it into egg slurry. Then due to the high attack speed, it rubs and heats in the air. It will eventually turn into egg tarts!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "?"</p>

    <p>So that night, after Sun Rong returned home, Sun Ying'er was captured again by Wang Ying overnight.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if Wang Ying was chopped into egg tarts.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Sun Ying'er won't be able to get this waist tomorrow...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wednesday, December 9th.</p>

    <p>In the morning, Wang Ying hasn't let Sun Ying'er come back yet. Sun Rong placed incense sticks on Sun Ying'er on the balcony. He returned to the desk and picked up the list of transfer students that Principal Chen gave him. He planned to go there. Take a good look at it on the way home from school.</p>

    <p>The first one on the previous list was Jiang Yingying. This suddenly made Sun Rong a little upset. As a result, she had not fully understood the information about other transfer students.</p>

    <p>When she went out, Jiang Xiaoche was already waiting for her at the door in her low-key black business car.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, Brother Xiaoche!" Sun Rong greeted. He opened the door and sat in the back seat.</p>

    <p>Her eyes happened to glance at the rearview mirror in front. She saw Jiang Xiaoche's listless face and a pair of deep dark circles under his eyes.</p>

    <p>"How do you feel that you didn't sleep well? Are you working overtime again?" Sun Rong asked. In her impression, Jiang Xiaoche rarely seemed to be so depressed.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche drove the car. He didn't know whether he should say these words to Sun Rong. But now he was feeling depressed and uncomfortable. He couldn't help but pour out his bitterness: "I seem to like it. Fucked a girl. Just..."</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoche's offer, ordinary girls wouldn't refuse, right? Unless the girl that Brother Xiaoche likes is not an ordinary person." Sun Rong analyzed: "Otherwise..."</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Jiang Xiaoche wondered.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Jiang Xiaoche seriously: "Brother Xiaoche. Could it be that the person you like is someone under 14 years old..."</p>

    <p>She recently watched a lawyer named Bao sexually assault his adopted daughter, and he kept saying that he was actually dating his adopted daughter... Such a shameless person made Sun Rong disgusted.</p>

    <p>That's why I have so many thoughts right now...</p>

    <p>"How can I be such a beast!" Jiang Xiaoche's mouth twitched: "But that girl is indeed a female high school student... I have thought about it carefully in the past two days. I found that I really like her! I can wait. !"</p>

    <p>"Do you have that girl's contact information?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... WeChat has it. I disabled hundreds of accounts last night. None of them have been added."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>After all, the person he was dating was a female high school student. It would be strange if Jiang Xiaoche still used the social way of communication and was not rejected!</p>

    <p>"I think it's better for you, Brother Xiaoche, not to harass others for the time being... What if that girl goes to the police? In the end, the police find you. What should you do if your grandpa finds out..." Sun Rong kindly reminded .</p>

    <p>"That's what the lady said. I will pay attention." Jiang Xiaoche held the steering wheel, regained his composure, and nodded.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed silently.</p>

    <p>After all, Jiang Xiaoche has watched her grow up since she was a child. The girl is not worried that Jiang Xiaoche has any particularly bad intentions. It's just that sometimes she acts naively...</p>

    <p>In the memory of Sun Rong, Mr. Boss Sun seems to attribute Jiang Xiaoche to "intermittent Tiehanhan syndrome."</p>

    <p>In other words, Jiang Xiaoche is usually quite smart.</p>

    <p>But once he encounters something that makes him entangled, he will do some stupid things...</p>

    <p>The car was halfway on the road. Jiang Xiaoche found that Sun Rong was looking at a roster very seriously. He couldn't help but feel curious: "What are you looking at, Miss?"</p>

    <p>"The roster of new transfer students. Principal Chen assigned me a task. He asked me to lead them to familiarize themselves with the campus environment." Sun Rong replied while looking at the roster intently.</p>

    <p>She has memorized most of the above information about new transfer students.</p>

    <p>What surprised Sun Rong was that there was actually a foreign transfer student in the list of transfer students this time.</p>

    <p>This is a girl from Sun Island. Her name is Jiugong Liangzi. According to the information, Jiugong's Mandarin is very poor. She is still in the learning stage.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is finally in line with international standards...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>As the car approached the entrance of Number 60 High School, the girl finally had the last page left on the roster.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong turned the page. I was shocked to find that the information on the last page did not belong to the student.</p>

    <p>"It's the new teacher's information!" Sun Rong's pupils shrank slightly.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, the student union should not be able to control the new teacher's information. That is a matter for the Human Resources Department... so the girl judged that there was a high probability that Principal Chen made a mistake when sorting out the information.</p>

    <p>With curiosity. Sun Rong began to carefully study the above information.</p>

    <p>Then I discovered that there were five new teachers in total.</p>

    <p>And one of them is the newly appointed vice principal and concurrently works as a mathematics teacher.</p>

    <p>It's just that the vice principal's name is a bit strange.</p>

    <p>Actually called Huo Ding...</p>

    <p>--etc!</p>

    <p>Huo...Ding?</p>

    <p>Isn't this just the word "lamp?"</p>

    <p>The girl suddenly thought of a familiar person...</p>

    <p>Is it possible?</p>

    <p>Is Senior Jin Deng the new vice principal and math teacher?</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception. Has it finally reached the point where it has fully penetrated Number 60 High School...</p>
