  <h1>Chapter 2174 2 Worlds</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The closest active volcano to Fuyun Town. When Mr. Canghu came here with his hired convoy, the reality of facing the volcano at close range still made him feel a sense of awe for nature.</p>

    <p>The ancient active volcano alchemy method. In modern cultivation methods, this is a taboo method. But this is the game world. There are no taboos.</p>

    <p>I looked back at the hired convoy. This was a regiment hired directly by Mr. Canghu from Fuyun Town. They were all uniform. But the strength of the team was absolutely strong. Even the driver driving the cart was level 85. NPCs were level 60 or above. It's already very scary. And the proportion of those who have reached level 80 or above in the fleet has reached 95%</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, hiring such a powerful fleet should cost a lot of money. But Mr. Canghu got a discount coupon. He hired it for a full 10 days. It only cost 1 tael of silver per day.</p>

    <p>In other words, Mr. Canghu only spent ten taels of silver to hire this fleet of 100 people with an average level of 85.</p>

    <p>This is not the most outrageous thing.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is the various spiritual medicinal materials used in the ancient active volcano elixir. One of the medicines requires the blood of top mythical beasts.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu originally wanted to hire a convoy to search for the top mythical beasts. But when he passed by the moat lake in the morning, the blood-swallowing god Kun under the moat appeared directly from the bottom of the lake and sprayed a mouthful of blood in his face.</p>

    <p>So that's it. The most difficult mythical beast blood is now available...</p>

    <p>"I feel that I have been clearly arranged." He looked at the blood of the mythical beast that he wiped from his face and collected in the jade jar. At this time, Mr. Canghu narrowed his eyes suspiciously and remained silent for a long time. He thought that he had become successful in the game with his profound knowledge. Logically speaking, he could definitely successfully complete the task assigned to him by Wang Ming this time.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu suddenly felt that something was wrong with this Fuyun Town than he imagined...</p>

    <p>That's all.</p>

    <p>Just follow the plan first.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu has never forgotten his mission. His mission is to attract the attention of players in the Itinerant Immortal Ring World and the entire world. Let these players gather in one place to complete Operation Wall Breaker.</p>

    <p>He spent dozens of hours using various magical elixir formulas. He developed a variety of elixirs based on the conditions of various places and opened up the elixir network in the entire Itinerant Immortal world.</p>

    <p>Whether in the game or in the real world, for a monk, pills are necessary for practicing. So from the moment he entered the game, Mr. Canghu had already formulated this strategy.</p>

    <p>It can be said that from the beginning, he used his profound knowledge to accurately grasp the psychology of every player. Including the ancient method of active volcano alchemy at this moment.</p>

    <p>In Mr. Canghu's opinion, this will be the climax of the plot. As a taboo alchemy, no monk will be curious about the ancient method of alchemy on active volcanoes.</p>

    <p>What Mr. Canghu expected was that not long after he and his convoy arrived at the red-sun active volcano near Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>In the distance, commotion began to be heard.</p>

    <p>Many players who heard about this incident rushed towards him with their spiritual swords or riding mounts. Although Mr. Canghu had seen a lot of great things in the world, the scene in front of him still made him feel excited.</p>

    <p>From a distance, the players from all over the world of Itinerant Immortal gathered together on the skyline. It was a magnificent scene. They were clearly here to join in the fun, but they looked like an army united to help.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu was a little more vigilant. Although most of the players who came to join in the fun were just watching a show, Mr. Canghu thought that there were definitely some troublemakers among them.</p>

    <p>In the long motorcade, there was an iron horse-drawn carriage. Old Huang quietly opened the curtain inside the carriage and looked out the window.</p>

    <p>"It's the aura of strength." Lao Huang said with a frown. He immediately looked at Wang Ling who was standing aside and looked extremely calm.</p>

    <p>This is a hidden carriage. It is hidden in the fleet hired by Mr. Canghu.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu is not aware of the existence of Wang Ling. It will not be shown on the list of people employed by Mr. Canghu. On this trip, he is here to ensure the safety of Mr. Canghu.</p>

    <p>Xiongwu in the real world has been captured. But in the world of Itinerant Immortal, he still exists.</p>

    <p>This is not because someone gave Xiongwu a power leveling game account. It's that Xiongwu's virtual character has completed the transformation into reality.</p>

    <p>All because of the mysterious gray mist released by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels. Now it's time to really start a contest with Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>The time has come.</p>

    <p>And his mission on this trip is not only to protect the safety of Mr. Canghu. It is also to help complete the Wall Breaker operation. To make the world of Itinerant Immortal, which has been affected by the gray fog, become real. Players who are completely unaware of this matter return to the real world.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Yi Jianchuan's Yaju was in the middle. He was stroking Wang Muyu's seven-color dragon horn. The expression on his face was almost frozen.</p>

    <p>He seemed to have thought of something and sighed: "I didn't expect that I could still see a real dragon after living for thousands of years..."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan felt that he was a little too slow. He should have thought of Wang Muyu's true identity.</p>

    <p>In this way, it becomes clear why Wang Muyu has such amazing talents and combat abilities at a young age...</p>

    <p>So this little guy has been pretending to be a pig and eating a tiger from the beginning. He is acting with him. And this is probably the result of having restrained himself. Otherwise, the damage caused by the little guy during the trial may not be as simple as destroying buildings.</p>

    <p>"Teacher knows about the Dragon Clan?"</p>

    <p>"Although the human monks are far away from the dragon clan. A long period of time has passed, but the human monks' research on true dragons has never stopped." Yi Jianchuan said frankly, stroking his beard.</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu Alliance actually issued a report about the Dragon Clan in the Eternal Era. But it was extremely confidential information. Only a few people knew about it. Even among the ten generals, only some old guys with enough seniority knew about it.</p>

    <p>And Yi Jianchuan is one of them.</p>

    <p>It's just that Yi Jianchuan didn't expect that he would now accept a true dragon as his disciple...</p>

    <p>That's not right...</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Wang Muyu was recommended to him by Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>In other words, this kid Diulei has known about the existence of real dragons for a long time?</p>

    <p>With Lord Diulei's level of strength, it is quite outrageous to be able to touch a real dragon cub.</p>

    <p>Previously, he had always suspected that there must be an expert behind Lord Diulei's Office of Strategic Deception... Sure enough, there must be a more powerful senior hiding behind it, right?</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan touched his head. It felt like the amount of information suddenly increased.</p>

    <p>But he didn't say it directly.</p>

    <p>He just glanced at Wang Muyu secretly, and finally sighed: "Muyu, I am your teacher. Does that mean I am taking advantage of you?"</p>

    <p>This is a true dragon born in human form.</p>

    <p>In Yi Jianchuan's view, Wang Muyu's existence is a legend within a legend. It makes people feel unreal.</p>

    <p>It's like beings from two worlds...</p>
