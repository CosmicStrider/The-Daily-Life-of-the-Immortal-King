  <h1>Chapter 1650 The mysterious rich man</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Immortal people show the way... correct the law with fists!"</p>

    <p>At the scene, a commentator called out and screamed. Everyone stared at this scene in stunned silence. It was really hard to believe that a newcomer actually defeated a burly man with a move of "immortal guidance." Crab.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the crab's lower body is almost entirely made up of parts. Although it is also connected to pain nerves, it is not fatal.</p>

    <p>This punch may seem scary. But in fact, the crab only needs to replace its parts.</p>

    <p>But what has to be said is that Jiugong Liangzi's punch really hit the crab's vital part, leaving his body trapped in place and unable to move anymore.</p>

    <p>After cleaning up the crabs, Jiugong Liangzi felt that his heart was filled with heat. He could no longer contain it.</p>

    <p>This is just an ordinary punch...</p>

    <p>As a result, the on-site commentator was shocked and interpreted it as "immortal people guiding the way."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi considers himself not an old boxer. The best way to fight in daily life is to summon ghosts to assist in fighting. He is a cultivator who belongs to the "Summoning Style" school.</p>

    <p>So in fact she doesn't know any boxing skills at all.</p>

    <p>I just used the crab in front of me as a sandbag to vent my anger.</p>

    <p>"What is the origin of this palace?" Zhu Yuanrun's face changed in shock.</p>

    <p>Among the five gatekeepers he sent, this crab's comprehensive strength was already at the upper-middle level, but it was dealt with so easily. This was something he never expected.</p>

    <p>He looked nervous for a while. After thinking about it, he said to the boy beside him: "Go. Let Hei Long bring that thing. Use it when necessary... Be sure to put this unknown person in the room." Intercept him within five levels. Or fight with him to delay time."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>The young man nodded one after another and immediately stepped back and followed the instructions.</p>

    <p>In the surrounding spectator seats, Zhou Ziyi noticed that scene from a distance.</p>

    <p>He was very observant, especially the boy standing next to Zhu Yuanrun. He had actually been observing secretly for a long time: "Brother Zhuo, and Brother Zong... that man is going back and forth. He seems to be planning something."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled: "Zi Yi has good eyesight. Maybe he is preparing some props?"</p>

    <p>"Props?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi is not stupid and quickly thought of things like stimulants...</p>

    <p>If it were a regular boxing match, this would definitely be illegal.</p>

    <p>But Zhou Ziyi forgot a very important premise: this is an underground boxing ring! It is a shady place! It is a place where the powerful in the core area use money to expose their bad tastes...</p>

    <p>And in a place like this, all kinds of shady stories will exist.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry too much, Zi Yi. Mr. Gong will definitely win, no matter what tactics the opponent plans to use." Qin Zhong crossed his arms and said extremely calmly.</p>

    <p>It started when he chose to bet on Hu Baoguo and ended up failing.</p>

    <p>Luck is no longer on the side of the two great traders, Zhu Yuanrun and Hu Baoguo.</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun wanted to make stable money. But the appearance of this "Gong" disrupted his overall plan.</p>

    <p>In the next few levels of attack, you don't need to think too much to know that the opponent will definitely come up with some dirty tricks.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter how dirty it is. As long as he's here.</p>

    <p>Using luck to cleanse oneself only takes a matter of minutes.</p>

    <p>You might even shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

    <p>It can be said that everything so far has been within Qin Zhong's expectations.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to surprises, they are not entirely absent.</p>

    <p>Because from the moment the man named "Gong" defeated the crab, Qin Zhong discovered a very strange phenomenon.</p>

    <p>That is, Zhuo Yi, who has been beside him, is still trembling slightly...</p>

    <p>And I don't know why. His face looks very bad.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>This voice once again made Zhuo Yi shudder in thought.</p>

    <p>"No...I'm not feeling uncomfortable..." Zhuo Yi replied.</p>

    <p>His eyes were fixed on the little white fist on the ring.</p>

    <p>Although he still can't believe it, this hand... looks more and more familiar to him.</p>

    <p>After all, just a while ago, he had just used Liangzi's hand with Jiugong Liangzi's consent...</p>

    <p>That kind of comfortable rhythm is simply incomparable when you make enough food and clothing by yourself.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi remember.</p>

    <p>That was his first time. It was also Jiugong Liangzi's first time.</p>

    <p>He had never been touched by anyone other than Jiugong Liangzi. It was also the first time for Jiugong Liangzi to be exposed to such a thing.</p>

    <p>This incident left a deep impression on the two of them.</p>

    <p>At least for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He remembered every inch of Jiugong Liangzi's hand in his bones.</p>

    <p>But if this person is really Liangzi...</p>

    <p>Why does she show up here to do black boxing?</p>

    <p>Who are the two remaining figures in the cloak?</p>

    <p>All kinds of questions linger in Zhuo Yi's mind.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation. Based on his understanding of Jiugong Liangzi, the person who can accompany Jiugong Liangzi to fool around and get closer recently... The first thing he thinks of is Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And the remaining person is definitely a powerful person.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, Jin Deng Monk... these are all possible.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi's mind was racing.</p>

    <p>If his inference is completely correct, then what is the reason for Liangzi and the others to hide their true identities...</p>

    <p>Now that we are all in this "Virtual Realm." Why not recognize him?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is puzzled by this. And has a very bad premonition.</p>

    <p>When he raised his head again, he found that Jiugong Liangzi had eliminated four gatekeepers.</p>

    <p>And there are still three full hours until the Martial Arts Competition ends!</p>

    <p>The last thing she has to face is Zhu Yuanrun's strongest thug ace - Hei Long!</p>

    <p>Compared to others, Hei Long doesn't have that much showiness. He just looks like a normal human being.</p>

    <p>His muscles are well developed, but not exaggerated, and just the right size. At the same time, his skin color is dark. Even the whites of his eyes are not visible. They are completely black.</p>

    <p>"This person, except for his eyes, looks a little strange, but he looks normal." At this time, Zhou Ziyi said.</p>

    <p>"Haha. Is this your first time watching Hei Long's game?" At this time, a spectator sitting next to Zhou Ziyi in the stands laughed.</p>

    <p>He was covered in jewels, and his ten fingers were covered with gemstone rings. They were sparkling. At first glance, you could tell that he was a powerful person living in the core area.</p>

    <p>But judging by his tone, this person was quite familiar. Before Zhou Ziyi could ask any more questions, he said to himself: "A true mechanized cultivator is not in the skin but in the bones. Take the previous crab as an example. He saw It seems mighty and domineering. But in fact, it is also easy to be targeted. But Hei Long is different... He is... the master's masterpiece."</p>

    <p>"That sir? The founder of this science and technology city?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong was also very curious about this.</p>

    <p>Because Zhu Yuanrun also mentioned this word before.</p>

    <p>Although the stands are far away from there, with the ears of Qin Zhong and Zhuo Yi, it is not difficult to hear.</p>

    <p>"No. It's just his disciple. But everyone is used to calling his disciple... that lord." The rich man said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"You actually want to talk to us?"</p>

    <p>"Hehe. Why not? We are of the same faction." The rich man shook the betting ticket in his hand: "I bet on Hu Baoguo to lose. Of course, besides that, maybe we have some other reasons."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned slightly: "What do you mean, sir?"</p>

    <p>The rich man held his cane. He smiled and said, "You guys should be Mr. Diulei's people, right?"</p>
