  <h1>Chapter 1433 Welcome the Immortal King!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is the power of heavenly calamity that the monk spent nearly 4,000 reincarnations condensing.</p>

    <p>In the process of every heavenly tribulation, monks have the habit of using ring scars to absorb the power of the heavenly tribulation, and then store it.</p>

    <p>All these energies will be entrenched in the monk's Tianling Cap as backup energy for emergencies.</p>

    <p>For example, when a monk travels around the universe, if his spiritual energy is insufficient, a catastrophe can bring him a huge amount of spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>For example, when a monk wants to eat hot pot, he will set up a pot above his head, put some vegetables in it, and use the spiritual energy brought by the tribulation to heat it.</p>

    <p>Another example is the monk's {Consecration}. The spiritual energy consumed by a consecration is actually very huge. It is much more convenient if the energy of the tribulation is there.</p>

    <p>And these stored tribulations can also be used as weapons!</p>

    <p>As long as it is combined with the iron elements in the body, the monk can quickly condense a missile coat containing the energy of the tribulation, and finally launch it from his own ring scar!</p>

    <p>"What a madman! He actually stored the heavenly calamity in his own Tianling Cap!" Peng Xiren didn't expect that the monk had such a method.</p>

    <p>The calamity energy is too manic!</p>

    <p>Is this thing something that can be stored in your head casually? If you don't do it right, your head will explode!</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Monk Jin Deng is indeed a tough guy!</p>

    <p>Such behavior is tantamount to a person installing a nuclear power plant in his head that is at high risk of leaking at any time... And now, the monk has used the "mobile nuclear power plant" in his head to create a large number of weapons.</p>

    <p>What a joke!</p>

    <p>This is not true at all!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren looked solemn. These calamity missiles launched seemed to be small in size, but their destructive power was huge! And most importantly, there were too many of them!</p>

    <p>It's no different than the scene where tens of thousands of divine punishment horses descend into the world!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren stared at the countless missile heads. He shrunk to the ground and immediately moved away to avoid it. However, these missiles have tracking functions and can completely ignore obstacles in front!</p>

    <p>The aura of catastrophe exuded from the warhead forms an energy coat that protects the warhead during the shuttle. It is a small meteorite that can ignore all obstacles in front of it.</p>

    <p>"We have to use something bigger to block it..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren gathered his punch power and punched through an asteroid in front of him. At the moment of passing through, he used the power of the stars to repair the damaged planet.</p>

    <p>This action was extremely fast. Some of the tracking missiles hit it directly.</p>

    <p>Then... directly blow up the planet to pieces.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The planet exploded. Accompanied by the shrill screams of the planet's spirit, fire and high temperatures soared into the sky!</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren looked behind him and found that a large number of calamity missiles rushed out of the explosion area in unison.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren did not expect that the power of this calamity missile would be so huge.</p>

    <p>He used this method to try to consume the missiles. However, he found that in fact, not much was consumed at all.</p>

    <p>The power of the calamity missiles is too great. Among the missiles at the front, only one or two can blow the planet to pieces. However, the large group of missiles following behind can still pass through safely without any damage.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing I can do. Monk... you forced me to do it." Peng Xiren realized at this moment that if he didn't come up with some means, he might be at a disadvantage in this battle.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to use the big killing move he wanted to make next. This move was originally used by Peng Xiren when he planned to deal with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Maybe you can kill that boy with one punch!</p>

    <p>But now. Peng Xiren felt that he had to take action.</p>

    <p>These tens of thousands of calamity missiles are indeed difficult to withstand.</p>

    <p>However, these calamity missiles were accumulated by the monks over time. They were not endless. Peng Xiren could only avoid them while gathering the power of the surrounding stars.</p>

    <p>He is like a moving black hole, absorbing all the nearby starlight and condensing it in his body.</p>

    <p>The monk saw that the star dragon mark on Peng Xiren was glowing.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk curled his lips abruptly.</p>

    <p>Because his purpose has been achieved.</p>

    <p>Originally, the monk's use of the Heavenly Tribulation Missile was not to kill Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>This man is extremely capable. There is definitely a way to deal with such a calamity missile.</p>

    <p>So from the beginning, the monk's purpose is to force Peng Xiren to do more "unique skills."</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling at this moment must also be watching this battle.</p>

    <p>As for the duel between him and Peng Xiren, winning or losing is not the key. The key is to be able to better see Peng Xiren on the other side.</p>

    <p>After firing approximately 160,000 calamity missiles, the monk's inventory has bottomed out. The blue fire on the scar on his head disappeared, and hot steam billowed outward.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren knew his time had come: "Monk! Your turn is over. It's my turn!"</p>

    <p>The monk raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He himself did not expect that the battle with Peng Xiren would turn out to be a turn-based game.</p>

    <p>However, what kind of skills will the opponent use?</p>

    <p>The monk himself was also very curious.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk raised his smoking head and looked forward.</p>

    <p>But he saw Peng Xiren suddenly stop somewhere deep in the galaxy outside the territory.</p>

    <p>Starlight surged all over his body, emitting a terrifying light! The starlight he had absorbed before completely burst out at this moment, just like a small sun!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The time ahead seemed to have stopped. One of these condensed starlights exploded. The time and space was actually distorted, causing a gap in the flow of time around them. The catastrophe missiles that were rushing forward at extremely fast speeds slowed down. Come down.</p>

    <p>At this moment, it was as if the entire universe was imprisoned. Only Peng Xiren exuded a starry sky of destruction, dazzling and dazzling.</p>

    <p>Such a miracle was so amazing that even the monk was surprised.</p>

    <p>A few seconds. It was an endless time...</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren punched the monk from a distance: "Galaxy Punch!"</p>

    <p>Boom! At this moment, all the starlight in Peng Xiren's body exploded at this moment. A billion-sized star dragon seemed to be able to rush directly to the end of the universe. It rushed towards the monk's body!</p>

    <p>This is a terrifying punch that condenses the power of countless stars!</p>

    <p>"Ouch!"</p>

    <p>As the star dragon approached the monk at the speed of light, it divided into thousands of ways. All the dragons roared together. The sound shook the entire universe!</p>

    <p>The galaxy outside the territory is no longer peaceful. The huge energy beam produced by the Galaxy Fist carries a posture of destroying everything. It smashes all obstacles in front of it!</p>

    <p>"Monk, this is the final blow!" Peng Xiren looked at his masterpiece with full confidence.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that the power of his Galaxy Fist is huge. If it were stored for a longer period of time, it would be even more powerful.</p>

    <p>This punch may not kill the monk, but it can seriously injure him. Peng Xiren thinks there is no problem at all.</p>

    <p>And just when the Galaxy Fist was about to approach the monk.</p>

    <p>At this time, a figure appeared in front of the monk.</p>

    <p>"Welcome the Immortal King!"</p>

    <p>The monk closed his eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's expression was calm. He stared at the incomparably bright star dragon incarnate as Galaxy Fist in front of him. He just blew a gentle breath.</p>

    <p>Whoop! A sound.</p>

    <p>The vast swath of starlight ahead was like a candle that was extinguished in an instant. All disappeared...</p>
