  <h1>Chapter 1882 The Peng family is ready to take action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the entrance of Chunlan Building. After Mrs. Shanxiu finished her report, she left with Mei Yunhai, Sun Fu, Chen Ren and Guo Jie.</p>

    <p>Sun Fu successfully received the letter of introduction to the Dongda Emperor Palace from the "Mr. Room 1." The pride in her heart was self-evident. Originally, Dongda Emperor only agreed to take Sun Fu with him temporarily. It was just a vague evasion. This move. I thought about waiting for the right time before rejecting Sun Fu.</p>

    <p>But now regarding the Book of Nine Realms, Mrs. Shanxiu has fulfilled her promise, which can be said to have made a great contribution. He feels that if he continues to refuse to agree to Sun Fu, it seems that he will not be able to live with it both emotionally and rationally.</p>

    <p>So, he immediately asked Zhang Zhui to draft a letter of recommendation using Li Ren's notes, stamped it with the royal seal prepared in advance to hide his identity, and then sent the entire letter to Sun Fu.</p>

    <p>As expected. After receiving the recommendation letter, Sun Fu was overjoyed.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. This is the Nine-Star Royal Family Seal! This man is really a great man...with a distinguished status! With this letter of recommendation, you can go to the Eastern Region Imperial Palace to practice. It is 100% possible!" People stared at the seals on the recommendation letters until their eyes widened.</p>

    <p>The royal family is a noble member with a distinguished status in any domain. But there are actually three, six or nine levels among the noble members.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the royal family with the Nine Star Seal only shows one thing. That is, the family background of this royal family is directly connected by blood with the emperor in the imperial palace! Therefore, the status is far more noble than that of ordinary royal families.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, madam! If it hadn't been for madam, I think this matter probably wouldn't have been possible." Sun Fu smiled. Her smile was bright, like a summer flower, with a dazzling splendor.</p>

    <p>"Sister Fu'er, do you really want to enter the Eastern Region Imperial Palace? Is there anything there that attracts you? Madam obviously has the best relationship with the Southern Region Imperial Palace. If you want to enter the Southern Region, Madam doesn't have to be that big. It takes a lot of trouble." Guo Jie asked.</p>

    <p>"I can only say that this is a kind of fate. I feel that I am destined to the Eastern Region Imperial Palace. And I seem to have met the gentleman in Room 1 somewhere before." Sun Fu said.</p>

    <p>"You will always have a chance to meet again..." Mrs. Shanxiu said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"We?" Sun Fu was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Yes... you..." Mrs. Shanxiu maintained her kind smile.</p>

    <p>She glanced at Sun Fu, Chen Ren and Guo Jie. There was a rather meaningful look in her eyes.</p>

    <p>On the other side, after sorting out the basic thoughts, Wang Ling has a clear idea of what to do next.</p>

    <p>If it goes as he expected, Peng Xiren will definitely continue to attack the Yang Scroll in his hand.</p>

    <p>Under such circumstances, he just had to sit back and wait. However, Wang Ling felt that he could not wait that long. He wanted to find Peng Xiren and understand the fate of this eternal period.</p>

    <p>However, the world of Eternity is so big and includes so many galaxies. Finding a single person among these vast planets is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

    <p>This will require the help of others.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling has contacted many partners now. As long as everyone cooperates together, it will not be difficult to find a Peng Xiren even if the universe is vast.</p>

    <p>"If we have the help of the other emperors and gather the power of our four emperors to set up a dragnet, it will be easier to find this Peng Xiren." Within the team's voice skills, Emperor Dongda said.</p>

    <p>"But the gathering of the four emperors has not started yet. How can we contact the other emperors?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>There are ways to contact the other great emperors. However, this method is not direct. You still need to wait for the responses of the other great emperors. And this delay may cause trouble.</p>

    <p>Therefore, according to Dongda's own analysis, it is best to have a person with hands and eyes that can reach the sky at this time. He can come out as a link to transmit intermediate information. Moreover, this person must also have a clear understanding of the positions of the four emperors.</p>

    <p>And the only person who could find such a person in this eternal world made Emperor Dongda think of Liu Muchen, the president of the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang...have you said before that Liu Renwen, the son of the president of the Central Auction House, is also one of your people?" At this time, Emperor Dongda suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. It also traveled from the modern cultivation society to eternity." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>"If this senior can be allowed to invite his father Liu Muchen to come out as Liu Renwen, the son of the auction house president, this Liu Muchen should be able to be used as a link to convey the message of our four emperors. And maybe he can have the means to show up in front of the gathering of the four emperors. Just find a place. Let's meet first." Emperor Dongda said.</p>

    <p>"He knows information about your four emperors? Who is this person?" Wang Ying was very curious.</p>

    <p>"It is said that this Liu Muchen was once Dao Ancestor Wang's personal guard..."</p>

    <p>"No wonder he has such skill." Wang Ying sighed.</p>

    <p>He felt that all this was an arrangement. Fortunately, the person who had time-traveled into Liu Renwen's body was Qin Zhong. So as long as Wang Ling remotely sent a message to Qin Zhong to ask him to do this, please It shouldn't be difficult for Liu Muchen to leave the mountain.</p>

    <p>In fact, Liu Muchen and Qin Zhong arrived faster than Wang Ling imagined. He only sent the order to Qin Zhong in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>

    <p>Two men in black robes who wrapped themselves tightly appeared at the door of Chunlan Tower.</p>

    <p>One of them is Qin Zhong, who traveled through Liu Renwen's body.</p>

    <p>Everyone here is surprised that things can be implemented so quickly.</p>

    <p>"Senior Qin got it done so quickly?" Sun Rong glanced at Qin Zhong who had taken off his hood. Then he saw the man standing next to Qin Zhong also took off his hood.</p>

    <p>This is a well-proportioned middle-aged man with a mustache. The first impression of Sun Rong has a sense of calmness and dignity. He exudes a touch of majesty.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than Liu Muchen himself.</p>

    <p>Considering that Liu Muchen had previously served as Dao Ancestor Wang's personal guard, it would not be too surprising to have such momentum.</p>

    <p>However, soon, Sun Rong found that Liu Muchen was gradually losing his strength. He first glanced at Sun Rong and said "Master's Wife."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately responded with a stunned look: "You...you are..."</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the calm and intimidating face began to distort. The moment he saw Emperor Dongda, he half-knelt on the ground with tears in his eyes. He rushed over crying: "Master, Master! I miss you so much." Ah! What would the disciples do without you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, even Wang Ling himself would not have thought that Zhuo Yi would actually travel through time to be Liu Muchen, the president of the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>This world is really too small!</p>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>
