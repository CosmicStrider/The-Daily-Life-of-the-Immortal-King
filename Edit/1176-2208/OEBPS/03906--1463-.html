  <h1>Chapter 1463 The extras have arrived</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It took Jiang Yingying several minutes to digest what he saw in front of him.</p>

    <p>Her thoughts were chaotic. Envy, jealousy, and...a little bit of hatred.</p>

    <p>All kinds of moods are mixed together like spilled seasonings, giving Jiang Yingying a mixed flavor.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that she didn't meet Wang Ling earlier.</p>

    <p>If only I could get to know him earlier!</p>

    <p>There is no way this rich young lady can be that familiar with Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Of course. She won't leave Sun Rong any chance.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it seems... it's not too late. After all, according to Jiang Yingying's own information, the relationship between Sun Rong and Wang Ling has not yet been officially determined.</p>

    <p>In other words, she still has a chance!</p>

    <p>She had asked the sanitation staff in the area for a long time to get the staff's clothes. It was not easy to get them.</p>

    <p>The previous sanitation supervisor rejected her harshly.</p>

    <p>She is so cute.</p>

    <p>Refuse again!</p>

    <p>Keep up the cuteness...</p>

    <p>When he was rejected for the third time, Jiang Yingying said something besides being cute: "My grandfather is Jiang Baosheng!"</p>

    <p>Then he took out his phone and showed a cute photo of himself and Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>The supervisor's expression suddenly changed and he handed over his clothes on the spot.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying felt that she must have been attracted by her cuteness.</p>

    <p>This trick has always worked.</p>

    <p>I went to the public women's restroom near the square and changed into a brand new set of clothes.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying wore a mask and sunglasses. She quickly changed her hair color with a hair dye, making her look like a foreign girl from the Western world.</p>

    <p>Then, she carefully put away the sanitation worker's clothes. She would be responsible for returning the clothes when the matter was over.</p>

    <p>At this time, the promised fake boyfriend had also arrived.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was wearing a peaked cap. He was also standing at the door very strictly.</p>

    <p>He was dragged here last night by Jiang Yingying who was begging for his life.</p>

    <p>Pretending to be a girlfriend...</p>

    <p>It's not like she's a real girlfriend. So what's the point?</p>

    <p>The key is. For Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying can only be regarded as his sister...if it weren't for Marshal Jiang always mentioning her and asking him several times about spiritual beasts, Wei Zhi would never have interacted with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>And the fact is, Wei Zhi doesn't need a girlfriend.</p>

    <p>He felt that he was already too busy just taking care of his domesticated spiritual beasts all day long.</p>

    <p>Spirit beasts are simple. They can also act cute. They don't have as many complicated thoughts and scheming as humans.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Wei Zhi felt that spending a lifetime with a spiritual beast was a good choice.</p>

    <p>"Brother Wei Zhi! It's up to you!" At this time, Jiang Yingying held Wei Zhi's shoulders, with two balls of fire in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi is not too tall. He is only slightly taller than Jiang Yingying. But from a distance, he looks like a boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>

    <p>"I know..." Wei Zhi pressed his hat, his expression slightly embarrassed.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for Marshal Jiang's sake, he wouldn't have come...</p>

    <p>And this mission is actually very dangerous for Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Because he knows all these people from Number 60 High School except Li Youyue!</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling is also his good brother. The master of Er Ha!</p>

    <p>"Let's go, Brother Wei Zhi! They are all in!" At this time, Jiang Yingying's sweet voice blocked Wei Zhi's thoughts. She took the initiative to hold Wei Zhi's hand and pulled Wei Zhi forward.</p>

    <p>"Yingying, please slow down..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi had no choice but to follow the girl's anxious pace.</p>

    <p>The two of them walked all the way towards the entrance. Wei Zhi was still a little confused about Jiang Yingying's sudden visit to him: "But I still don't understand why you came to me."</p>

    <p>"Originally... I wanted to find Brother Yi. But isn't he still in the hospital for treatment?"</p>

    <p>"He's not recovered yet?"</p>

    <p>"I heard he has recovered a little. He can walk normally after getting out of bed, but now he is a little afraid of seeing sharp objects."</p>

    <p>"..." Wei Zhi was stunned.</p>

    <p>An excellent spirit sword user.</p>

    <p>He is actually afraid of seeing sharp objects... It seems that the last time he faced off against Sun Rong, Yi Zhiyang was really hit hard.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was also paying attention to the competition at Jiulong Mountain.</p>

    <p>Later, I also heard about Yi Zhiyang's psychological trauma. I just didn't expect it to be so serious.</p>

    <p>"What will we do next?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we can only wait for him to overcome the obstacles on his own. There is no other way. Taking some time to relax is actually helpful for recovery. Originally, I said that I would come to the ancient street and ask him to help. Brother Yi is quite happy." Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>"What happened next?"</p>

    <p>"Later I said that Sun Rong would also come here. He was so frightened that his legs weakened on the spot."</p>

    <p>"So. I'm just a spare tire?"</p>

    <p>"That's not possible! If this thing doesn't work out in the end, then I will be with brother Wei Zhi!" Jiang Yingying acted like a baby. She knew that Wei Zhi would never have this idea.</p>

    <p>"Haha..." Wei Zhi smiled bitterly and shook his head: "I can tell you. I will help you just this time."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he reached out and gently hugged the girl's waist.</p>

    <p>Then we passed the ancient street entrance with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Since you are pretending to be your boyfriend, it is very important to act like him.</p>

    <p>As for being Jiang Yingying's real boyfriend, Wei Zhi couldn't even think about it.</p>

    <p>After all, the pressure from Marshal Jiang still exists.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a man in a black trench coat followed Wei Zhi and Jiang Yingying into the ancient street.</p>

    <p>He holds a Changyou card. There is no need to verify his identity. He always keeps a considerable distance from Jiang Yingying to avoid being discovered.</p>

    <p>He heard the news before that Jiang Yingying was asking someone else to pretend to be her boyfriend. After thinking about it, he still felt uneasy, so he decided to follow him and take a look in person.</p>

    <p>Judging from his movements, this man wearing a peaked cap seems to be very familiar with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>When a girl takes the initiative to hold each other's hand and walk forward.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche felt his heart twitch. He felt an inexplicable pain.</p>

    <p>Especially when he saw Wei Zhi taking the initiative to put his hand around Jiang Yingying's waist. Jiang Xiaoche felt that he almost fainted.</p>

    <p>Where did you find this old pervert!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche gritted his teeth when he saw this. He wanted to rush forward and separate the two people.</p>

    <p>Taking a few deep breaths, Jiang Xiaoche tried his best to calm down his emotions.</p>

    <p>His mission today is to ensure the safety of the girl.</p>

    <p>It's just the waist of the building. It's a matter of the girl's own volition. He's an outsider. He has no right to intervene.</p>

    <p>He needs to keep track of him at all times. Firstly, he can prevent this fake boyfriend from doing evil things. Secondly, he can also check out some suspicious people...</p>

    <p>For example, Jiang Xiaoche has discovered that there are several suspicious men on the ancient street.</p>

    <p>Although they were wearing casual clothes, their eyes were always alert.</p>

    <p>In addition, Jiang Xiaoche also noticed that the tattoo on the ankles of this group of people... Although it was not very clear from this angle, he could roughly confirm that it seemed to be a crow.</p>
