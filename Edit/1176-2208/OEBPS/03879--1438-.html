  <h1>Chapter 1438 The ancient black stone that King's Eyes cannot see through</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren...has he started to create new spells again?" The monk followed behind Wang Ling. He saw Wang Ling's hand condensing starlight. He felt that this scene looked familiar.</p>

    <p>He knew instantly. This must be some inspiration Wang Ling got from Peng Xiren. This led him to come up with a brand new skill.</p>

    <p>Although now the monk feels that he is just a soy sauce, but even if he is a soy sauce, for the monk, being able to watch and learn quietly beside Wang Ling is also a huge gain.</p>

    <p>In the inn, Er Ha and Wang Ying stared at the scene in front of them. Er Ha was amazed: "Created a new spell again? As expected of him... But... what should this move be called?"</p>

    <p>"{Star Sword Art·Profound Meaning·Light Years}" aside. Wang Ying answered.</p>

    <p>"Why is there such a middle-class name..." Er Ha's eyes twitched.</p>

    <p>"The name was not given by me. It was given by the explanation system of the Office of Strategic Deception." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>Now the Office of Strategic Deception has an internally developed Zongmen app. The Office of Strategic Deception explanation system is one of the functions in the app.</p>

    <p>This is a commentary system invented by Wang Ming. An artificial intelligence AI created with reference to Wang Ling's brain data.</p>

    <p>When you encounter a problem that you don't understand, you can simulate Wang Ling's thinking and explain various magical abilities of Wang Ling to the outside world in real time.</p>

    <p>"Why do you still have this thing?"</p>

    <p>"The app has just been developed. Even among the core members, only a small number of people are qualified for internal testing." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>He took out his mobile phone and put it in front of Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Er Ha saw a large list of information displayed on the screen.</p>

    <p>This newly developed set of spells, in addition to its full name, actually also has a short name.</p>

    <p>Er Ha feels that it is much better than the full name.</p>

    <p>[Spell Abbreviation]:Light Years Away</p>

    <p>[Spellcasting Principle]: By condensing a large amount of starlight power, it can produce concrete weapons. However, since the starlight power is difficult to condense, this trick can only be explained through the principle of science (Wang Ling science). It cannot be used. Conventional cultivation science explains</p>

    <p>[Suggested caster level]: Dear, I suggest you here. It is best to reach the full level!</p>

    <p>[Casting Difficulty]: For "Wang Ling (with Wang Ying)" → 1 star. For others → 10 stars</p>

    <p>(Note: When the difficulty reaches 10 stars, it is not recommended to learn this spell, because you will not be able to learn it)</p>

    <p>[Spell Power]: With devastating destructive power.</p>

    <p>[Spell Advantage]: Comes with a variety of passive skills.</p>

    <p>1: Comes with a halo that dissipates the weak. It can accurately lock the enemy and only attack the target. It will not harm innocent people (the earth no longer has to be afraid)</p>

    <p>2: 100% critical hit. And the critical hit damage is superimposed according to the number of light years formed. 1 light year length = 1 times the effect.</p>

    <p>3: Unstoppable effect. The casting process cannot be interrupted in any way unless canceled by the caster. And during the casting process, a powerful starlight barrier will be formed around the caster to block interference from various flying spells and props.</p>

    <p>4: Wrath of a single dog. This skill is a limited passive ability. It is only valid on the day of 520. If there is a target locked, an additional burning effect will be added.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shocked: "..."</p>

    <p>I have to say. This Office of Strategic Deception explanation system is a bit strong!</p>

    <p>Moreover, there is a bit of coquettishness in the strength.</p>

    <p>I can only say that it is worthy of the software developed by Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded: "It's not particularly exaggerated. It's quite realistic."</p>

    <p>This path {light years away} has many advantages. But the disadvantage is that the difficulty level is too high. I am afraid that no one else in the world can do it except the two of them.</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the middle of the screen, Er Ha, Wang Ying can see the starlight condensed in Wang Ling's right hand. It is rapidly extending forward at a speed invisible to sight.</p>

    <p>The starlight sword that Wang Ling condensed during the chase seemed to fall from the sky. It was radiant with stars and densely covered with runes. It contained terrifying power that could destroy everything!</p>

    <p>The monk was checking the instructions of the Office of Strategic Deception explanation system. At the same time, he was amazed at such a method.</p>

    <p>Condensing starlight is not difficult for the monk himself.</p>

    <p>But the difficulty is that he cannot gather so much starlight power in a short period of time like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Therefore. {Light Years Away} itself is also a charging type of spell.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Wang Ling's energy accumulation is too fast. Compared with Peng Xiren's {Galaxy Fist}, this energy accumulation speed is many times faster than him...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>He felt like he was in the same universe as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But it seems that they are not playing the same game.</p>

    <p>It feels like they are all in Summoner's Rift.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren himself is playing normal matching. And Wang Ling is playing unlimited firepower!</p>

    <p>The skill CDs are all different!</p>

    <p>How the hell are you still playing this!</p>

    <p>In the process of moving quickly, Peng Xiren felt the coldness on the back of his neck becoming more and more obvious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's Wang Ling's {light years away} has not yet ended. That powerful aura seemed to have turned into a knife and was placed on his neck.</p>

    <p>Things are not going well...</p>

    <p>It seemed that the other party really wanted to kill him.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>He began to regret what he had said in the beginning, saying that he was invincible in the context of the universe.</p>

    <p>Because he discovered the existence of Wang Ling. It is a BUG...</p>

    <p>However. After all, he is the only disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>It's not that Peng Xiren has never thought about how to save his life if he encounters a life threat.</p>

    <p>So. Just when Wang Ling's star sword was about to pierce Peng Xiren's body.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren almost gritted his teeth and offered something.</p>

    <p>"An...ancient stone?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. He found a round stone emitting black light. It had a smooth surface and was as big as a cabbage. He tried to peek with King's Eyes. As a result, King's Eyes' sight was blocked by the black light emitted by the black round stone. outer.</p>

    <p>You can't...can't see clearly inside?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised.</p>

    <p>This is also a situation that has never been seen before.</p>

    <p>His King's Eyes. In terms of ability, it can be said to be incomparable.</p>

    <p>Although there is still a lot of room for improvement in strength now.</p>

    <p>But in theory.</p>

    <p>There shouldn't be anything that exists in this universe that King's Eyes can't see through.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, King's Eyes' sight was actually blocked by the black light of this round ancient stone.</p>

    <p>This started to make Wang Ling full of curiosity.</p>

    <p>Could it be that there is something in this ancient stone that can limit his power?</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I don't want to take this thing out easily. But if you insist on forcing me, don't blame me for being rude. If you want to kill me, we will die together."</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren was manipulating the ancient stone. He held it with only one hand and raised it high above his head.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling's starlight sword pierced through.</p>

    <p>The sword body was actually directly affected by the power of this ancient stone. It was like a sea divided into two. It avoided Peng Xiren and fled from both sides of his body.</p>

    <p>"puff!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren, who was holding the ancient stone high, spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>He clearly did not stab Peng Xiren. Is this also a case of porcelain?</p>

    <p>"No. Zhenren. It's the problem with the stone." Monk Jin Deng frowned and analyzed on the side.</p>

    <p>He believed that the real reason why Peng Xiren vomited blood did not lie in Wang Ling's move {light years away}.</p>

    <p>It was simply the result of being influenced by this strange ancient stone.</p>

    <p>This is also the reason why Peng Xiren didn't want to sacrifice this thing in the first place...</p>

    <p>There seems to be something magical in the ancient stones. It is like the radiation of rare metals. It is extremely harmful to the body.</p>

    <p>Every second Peng Xiren holds the stone, hundreds of millions of cells in his body die.</p>

    <p>"interesting."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the boulder with a calm expression. Cancel the spell Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It wasn't because he was afraid. It was because he was worried that the ancient stone would be accidentally damaged by him.</p>

    <p>This ancient stone is not very big. Although there seems to be something on it that can limit his power. But now he is not using all his strength.</p>

    <p>If we take it seriously, even if Peng Xiren has the power of this ancient stone, it will be difficult to resist.</p>

    <p>After all, the size of the stone itself is still too small.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the substance in the ancient stone that can actually limit one's own power has not been purified. The effect of limiting one's power is limited.</p>

    <p>So now Wang Ling is curious.</p>

    <p>Where did Peng Xiren get this ancient stone?</p>

    <p>In this vast universe, are there still the same type of stones?</p>
