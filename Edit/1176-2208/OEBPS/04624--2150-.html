  <h1>Chapter 2150 Invalid Attack</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong relies on the divine skill {Jian Lai Gong} that she suddenly realized at the beginning. In addition to reducing sword damage by 75%, each time she is attacked, she can also superimpose a layer of passive abilities.</p>

    <p>That is: while gaining 1 permanent agility attribute point, each level of passive ability will also determine the number of spirit swords that Sun Rong can control at the same time.</p>

    <p>Currently, the level of Sun Rong is level 48. In other words, as long as you carry a sword weapon with a level no higher than level 48 and a special effect sword weapon with [unlimited level], Sun Rong can easily control it.</p>

    <p>Whether it was fate or not, Sun Rong possessed such natural self-control. It can only be said that when facing the vast army of the four elephants, she held such a divine skill and felt no fear whatsoever.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, she's really look forward to this group of Sword Immortal players cutting on her more so that she can stack up their passive abilities.</p>

    <p>As for the level of damage, it seems that Sun Rong can only be described with the word "scraping therapy."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is now at level 48, a level 48 ancient heavy armor cultivator with all defensive attributes. She is still wearing the full set of purple equipment that she obtained when she attacked the Hundred Caves Demon Lord with the General of Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>The current Sun Rong not only has extremely high defense, but also has an astonishingly thick health bar.</p>

    <p>5000 health. Almost as much as an early map boss.</p>

    <p>And Xiong Wu's sword looked majestic, but it only cut off 10 points of blood.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this incredible scene, the hearts of the Four Elephants players couldn't help but feel a wave of excitement.</p>

    <p>Many surrounding players also showed expressions of watching the fun. They originally had no hope for this level 48 associate deputy general. However, they did not expect that the strength of this deputy general was beyond their expectations.</p>

    <p>That was Xiongwu, wielding a greatsword and known throughout the gaming world for his high burst damage! The founder of the violent sword immortal style... and yet he only managed to cut off 10 points of health with a single sword strike, which is simply outrageous!</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency really has a good piece of equipment..."</p>

    <p>The sword strike just now was very embarrassing. And Xiong Wu was also trying his best to find compensation for himself. He attributed the damage result of 10 points of blood to Sun Rong's magical equipment.</p>

    <p>"You must have a [counter-strike] special effect equipment on you, right?"</p>

    <p>In the Itinerant Immortal magic ring, there is a very low probability that equipment will trigger different special effects when it is dropped or forged.</p>

    <p>For example, the [unlimited level] weapons mentioned earlier are weapons that can cross levels. Even if the weapon level is higher than the character level, it can still be used.</p>

    <p>Another example is the [never wears off], [does not drop after death], etc. on Lao Huang. They are also special effects.</p>

    <p>The [counter-strike] mentioned by Xiong Wu is a life-saving type. It is a special effect that may only appear in armor or accessories. When the special effect is subjected to a high-damage attack, the first damage can be limited to a very small value range. Inside.</p>

    <p>But this value is usually 100 or several hundred. At least, there are dozens.</p>

    <p>But at 10 points...</p>

    <p>This is the first time for many players here to see it.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that you have such a special effect equipment. Its value is higher than ordinary orange equipment even if it is purple quality. Because it is so rare!</p>

    <p>It can directly resist the initial burst attack. It is very helpful for the next dungeon and PVP.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Sun Rong is very clear about her situation. She knows that she does not have such special effects equipment at all. It is just a high defense and a thick health bar.</p>

    <p>But Xiong Wu was clearly stubborn; he simply didn't believe that if he could destroy a black dragon, killing a heavily armored cultivator would be so difficult! His greatsword struck the black dragon's mountain of scales, instantly tearing its flesh and leaving it a bloody mess.</p>

    <p>"Next blow. I'm going to be serious!" He shouted while riding on his flying elephant in the void. In the next second, his appearance changed. His long golden hair was scattered. Even his pupils turned dark gold. The color burst out with a strange light.</p>

    <p>The sect owner... has switched to violent mode!</p>

    <p>Many people were silent about this scene. And Li Bai and Mang Shan were even more familiar with Xiong Wu's image transformation. This is because this is Xiong Wu's common operation in the dungeon. By superimposing various special effects on the equipment, such a seemingly transformed effect can be achieved. Not only the attributes in all aspects are increased several times, but also the halo bonus and changes in hair color and eye color attached to its special effects can make Xiong Wu completely transformed in a short time, creating a slight sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>"That's outrageous! They're just showing off their power because of their rank."</p>

    <p>Mang Shan couldn't stand it anymore. He was about to step forward to help, but was blocked by Li Bai.</p>

    <p>Li Bai: "Let's take a look first. If there is really any danger, it won't be too late for us to take action."</p>

    <p>Li Bai has a good sense of people. From the first moment he saw Sun Rong, he felt that this deputy general was not a simple person. And he always had a feeling. The feeling first struck Sun Rong. The 10 points of blood caused by the knife were definitely not caused by the equipment's special effects.</p>

    <p>Soon!</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu's next attack began. Golden flames covered the sword. A larger golden moon slashed across the sky. It was accompanied by flames and electric light. There was a constant sizzling sound from above. It was extremely terrifying.</p>

    <p>The power of this sword light seemed to be enough to break mountains. But Sun Rong still chose to stand still in the face of this sword. She did not dodge at all. It was as if she was determined to take this sword.</p>

    <p>In the end, the two collided, and a deafening sound broke out again. Smoke and dust were scattered all around under the collision, and then dispersed little by little with the strong wind.</p>

    <p>Everyone rubbed their eyes. They were shocked to find that Sun Rong was still standing there. She was as thick as an immovable Five Elements Mountain. She showed a demon king-level defense ability!</p>

    <p>Take a look at the damage. Compared to the 10 points of damage just now, Xiong Wu's blow was indeed done with all his strength... causing three times the damage to Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>A full...30 points!</p>

    <p>Everyone was startled. Almost everyone was stunned. Is this definitely a blow in which Xiong Wu switched to the violent flow form? It only cut 30 drops of blood...</p>

    <p>How outrageous!</p>

    <p>Many people were shocked. Between Sun Rong and Xiong Wu. After checking for more than ten levels... the total damage of two attacks against an opponent higher than their own level was not even 60!</p>

    <p>It didn't even reach the passing mark!</p>

    <p>"Let me just say. This deputy general is not an ordinary person." Li Bai said. He was completely relieved. Although this Fuyun Town is a novice village, it is indeed full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Moreover, this was the first time he had seen such a heavily armored cultivator. He was very curious about how Sun Rong had managed to stack up such high defense.</p>

    <p>"I've never seen someone who can block damage despite the level difference..." Mang Shan said the same thing.</p>

    <p>"I think it's not just the deputy general who is extraordinary. The old Mr. Huang sitting next to the deputy general is also extraordinary." Li Bai said, "Did you see his weapon? It’s indestructible, and it won’t fall off even in death… Could an ordinary person possess something like that?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Li Bai, I understand the truth. But we just want to know. This deputy general and Wolong are so outrageous. Then how monstrous is the general behind Fuyun Town?" Mang Shan said in surprise.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the general's mansion, Wang Ling slowly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>He is observing everything silently with his own devine eyes...</p>
