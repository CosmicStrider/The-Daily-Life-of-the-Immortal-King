  <h1>Chapter 1368 The Strongest Foundation Building</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is a "space stabilizing auxiliary magic weapon" developed by Dao Ancestor Wang. Its precious value is self-evident.</p>

    <p>Rumor has it that Dao Ancestor Wang has made a total of nine Rubik's cubes.</p>

    <p>However, in his 4,000 reincarnation experiences, the monk really encountered the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. He only saw it after clearing the unspeakable place this time.</p>

    <p>At this point, Monk Jin Deng actually had an inference in his mind.</p>

    <p>Those are the remaining eight Rubik's Cubes. It is very likely that they were used by Dao Ancestor Wang in other places to stabilize the space.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor is so powerful. He definitely has more than one core world.</p>

    <p>Even many of the Dao Gods in God's Domain are "dual-core" Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>The two members of the Wang family and the Gu family have even reached the level of three to four cores.</p>

    <p>In the case of Dao Ancestor, the core world that can be created will definitely increase by another order of magnitude.</p>

    <p>Use the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube to externalize the core world. This method was probably only possible by Dao Ancestor Wang himself before Wang Ling was born.</p>

    <p>Now. The Unspeakable Land is destroyed.</p>

    <p>In other words, Dao Ancestor Wang's external core world like "The Unspeakable Land." There are 8 more.</p>

    <p>If you add the main body, maybe there are already dozens of them?</p>

    <p>The core world represents the limit of spiritual energy that a cultivator can contain. The more cores there are, the stronger the spiritual energy will naturally be.</p>

    <p>And the core world of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The monk speculated. Perhaps greater than or equal to Dao Ancestor Wang?</p>

    <p>But even if it is larger than that, the monk feels that the quantity will not be too different.</p>

    <p>What he estimated was Dao Ancestor Wang's "previous level."</p>

    <p>In this long history, although monsters like Wang Ling were born, Dao Ancestor Wang himself also continued to grow up in reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Although Monk Jin Deng does not know where Dao Ancestor Wang is.</p>

    <p>However, according to the comprehensive inference of Dao Ancestor's growth value, Dao Ancestor Wang currently has no less than a hundred core worlds in his body.</p>

    <p>"Let's get started."</p>

    <p>All preparations for upgrading Aohai were ready. The monk began to instruct the second-generation demon saint and Shen Wuyue to start upgrading the altar.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The whole altar began to tremble.</p>

    <p>A beam of light reaches the sky and flies through the floating clouds. The sky of the entire demon world instantly turns dark purple, exuding a powerful oppressive force.</p>

    <p>"Has the Demon Saint started it? The Demon Realm is really going to be upgraded!"</p>

    <p>The demon world was in a commotion at this moment. All the demon clans were looking at the sky eagerly.</p>

    <p>A strange light suddenly appeared above the Holy Pillar of the Demon Realm with a "buzzing" sound. Then the terrifying power of chaos was like a spear. It suddenly pierced the altar!</p>

    <p>Huge energy poured out from the sky. The clouds were steaming and the clouds were glowing. It fell like a waterfall from the top of the sky. The demon clan had never seen such a scene before. They were all amazed.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, with the Holy Pillar of the Demon Realm as the center, the entire Demon Realm was shaken. The energy of the power of chaos impacted the altar. At the same time, it began to be diverted under the guidance device arranged by the monk in advance.</p>

    <p>Violent fluctuations came from the top of the holy pillar, and then expanded to the 108 areas of the demon world. Like a mountain torrent, a huge roar broke out.</p>

    <p>At the same time, countless illusions were falling in the void.</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked.</p>

    <p>This is the illusion produced when the power of chaos impacts. It is frightening and full of lethality!</p>

    <p>Compared with the upgrade path on earth, the upgrade in the demon world seems to be more bumpy than the upgrade on earth.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, let's go!"</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Sun Ying'er pulled Sun Rong away and quickly retreated.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "It is an illusion of chaos. When using the power of chaos to upgrade the world, there is a certain probability that it will occur!"</p>

    <p>She reacted quickly. She dragged Sun Rong away almost immediately to avoid being directly hit by the core.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong's physical body has been enlightened, Sun Ying'er still feels that this would be safer.</p>

    <p>She must make sure Sun Rong is foolproof.</p>

    <p>Oh!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Wang Ying, a big pervert, would use her excuses again!</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng stands in the center of the chaotic storm.</p>

    <p>He began to bring the second-generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue into his core world.</p>

    <p>The moment he completed the action, his whole person was instantly enveloped in the illusion of chaos.</p>

    <p>Under the impact of the powerful illusion of chaos, from the perspective of others, the monk's body began to become distorted, as if it had been drawn into some vortex.</p>

    <p>However, soon, this distorted power was forcibly corrected under the monk's powerful Buddha light.</p>

    <p>A huge "卍" character burst out from the monk's pupils!</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, Buddha's light intertwined. The powerful magic power of Buddhism's holiest surged out of the monk's body at this moment!</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng is so powerful!" Even under the protection of Sun Ying'er. Sun Rong can still feel the huge pressure brought by the illusion of chaos.</p>

    <p>But Monk Jin Deng stands alone in the center, defeating everyone. He is so brave!</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The huge "卍" character keeps enlarging. It attacks the illusion of chaos. It crushes the alien beasts generated by the illusion!</p>

    <p>Everything is dazzling to see Sun Rong. Monk Jin Deng is extraordinary. He is indeed handsome.</p>

    <p>However, she also weakly expressed her opinion: "If it were classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>The words were on his lips. Sun Rong could not continue because he felt that these remarks might be a little inappropriate.</p>

    <p>As a result, Sun Ying'er beside her poured out all her unsaid words: "That's for sure! Ling Zhenren might be able to break this illusion of chaos just by blowing his breath. There is a saying. A monk can be handsome again. But there are indeed some All bells and whistles."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er didn't actually say this loudly, but when the monk who was resisting the impact heard it, he was unsteady and almost spit out a mouthful of blood...</p>

    <p>About dozens of seconds passed. The illusion of chaos was torn apart by the monk.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Chaos Impact also ended.</p>

    <p>The vision in heaven disappeared.</p>

    <p>The twelve ancient sword king pillars absorbed enough chaotic energy and burst out with light in an instant! After dispersing the power of chaos accumulated in the pillars, they quickly turned into powder and disintegrated on the spot.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the energy of the twelve pillars was also injected into the top, eventually causing the Soul-Severing Blade to fall.</p>

    <p>The blue lotus bursts out!</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The Soul-Slaying Blade was extremely sharp. The blade cut through Aohai's body, splitting it in half.</p>

    <p>The monk seized the opportunity and inserted the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube into the divided crack.</p>

    <p>Then he used his palm power to reunite Aohai, who had been separated by the Soul-Slaying Blade.</p>

    <p>This action took the monk a lot of effort. In the process of merging Aohai, he obviously consumed a huge amount of spiritual energy. It seemed to be more difficult than resisting the illusion of chaos.</p>

    <p>The main reason is this Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. It is also the first time that the monk has manipulated it. He is not too familiar with it.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is also due to the monk's caution.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. This is the only one I have now. If the fusion fails... it will be a waste! Even the monk himself cannot forgive himself!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the whole process went smoothly.</p>

    <p>"Merge!" After a few minutes, the monks shouted loudly together. The separated Aohai was successfully re-merged!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was surprised to find that Aohai's image also changed.</p>

    <p>Compared to the original Aohai, the current Aohai's appearance seems to be about ten years older than before. He has become more mature and charming.</p>

    <p>She was wearing a gorgeous dark blue evening dress. Her turquoise eyes were like shining sapphires under the deep sea. Her silver-gray hair hung down, with beautiful curls like waves at the end.</p>

    <p>"After integrating the power of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube, it is really extraordinary." After the second-generation demon saint was released from the core world by the monk, he couldn't help but admired: "Now the sword spirit space of Miss Sun's Aohai sword. The core world is so vast...and... it also incorporates Miss Ying'er's disaggregated laws!"</p>

    <p>"Too strong..." Shen Wuyue also sighed.</p>

    <p>A Foundation Building period actually has a core world...</p>

    <p>This is simply outrageous!</p>

    <p>"But why does Miss Sun not seem so happy?" asked the second generation Demon Saint.</p>

    <p>"Because Aohai has grown up." Sun Ying'er said bluntly.</p>

    <p>She stared at Aohai's grown breasts. She shrugged and sighed: "It would be great if Rongrong were as big as that!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Rongrong is older, so am I. I actually don't care about this anymore. It's better to have a small one. It's better to have a big one. Bigger. When Wang Ying's ball hits me, I will It can be used to absorb shock."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "When the time comes, it will be like wearing two air-cushion shoes on my chest. How great!</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. What nonsense are you talking about..."</p>

    <p>( ˘︹˘ )</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was embarrassed and annoyed.</p>

    <p>She wanted to sew Sun Ying'er's mouth shut...</p>
