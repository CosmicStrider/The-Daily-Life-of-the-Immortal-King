  <h1>Chapter 1929 Wang Ling's way of breaking the door</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling is still observing the situation at the scene. Wang Ling has completely understood the secret technique cast on the door of Jiutian Teahouse. This is a test of physical strength.</p>

    <p>In other words, as long as you don't use spells, you can use other physical attacks to break in.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>A girl wearing a ranger-style school uniform was obviously aware of this. She stood in front of the teahouse with her bow and arrows fully drawn.</p>

    <p>The golden arrow is simple and unpretentious. It rubs the air with a harsh sound. It shuttles through the void and traces an extremely beautiful trajectory.</p>

    <p>Finally, it was firmly nailed to the door of Jiutian Tea House. After waiting for a moment, the arrow was directly swallowed by the door.</p>

    <p>"What a good arrow! It's just a tiny bit less powerful than the preset standard. It will pass the certification." Jing Heqiu sighed as he stood beside Wang Ling in the distance.</p>

    <p>From a long distance, he recognized the young man who was shooting arrows as Zhang Linyan from Emperor Shi Tianzhong. Emperor Shi Tianzhong was the third-ranked cultivation institution in the country. It was also the school where Fang Xing attended before transferring to their school.</p>

    <p>The students who can study there have unusual family backgrounds and identities. However, generally speaking, the students of Emperor shi Tianzhong are very low-key. Moreover, the school adopts a closed education system.</p>

    <p>That is to say, although they are ranked among the top three in the country, the styles of colleges such as Shengke and Jingba, which are active all year round on self-media channels and use traffic to create stars, are completely different. Students from Emperor Shi Tianzhong are generally cruel and talkative. There are extremely low-key.</p>

    <p>The Zhang Linyan in front of me is the best example. She never said a word from beginning to end. She seemed to have no sense of existence. But in fact, she became a blockbuster as soon as she made a move.</p>

    <p>The arrow Zhang Linyan just shot obviously did not exert its full power. Her black hair fell down around her waist. She raised the bow again, looking heroic.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the stunning feeling brought by Zhang Linyan's attack even surpassed that of the popular Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>In front of the teahouse, everyone held their breath and stared at this scene.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>This is the second arrow. The strong wind roars, tearing the earth apart. The flags on the old gatehouses in the ancient streets are all floating due to this sword. Some signs cannot even withstand the wind pressure of the strong wind and are directly brought down by this arrow.</p>

    <p>This time, Zhang Linyan's arrow successfully pierced the door of Jiutian Teahouse. And she was immediately certified. Her whole body turned into light particles and disappeared directly. Then she was sucked into the vortex formed in front of Jiutian Teahouse.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked cold. He stood on the eaves with Jing Heqiu from beginning to end. Although he already understood what Jing Heqiu meant, it didn't matter even if he broke the door.</p>

    <p>But after all, there are other people testing here. Based on years of quality education, Wang Ling still plans to wait and see.</p>

    <p>After all, after he breaks through the door, the group behind him may never have the chance to participate in the test again.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Sister Zhang. This archery skill is superb." Li Changzhe sighed sincerely. He still showed his true nature of being a dog-licker, with an exquisite style.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't hate Li Changzhe. He even thinks this person is a bit interesting.</p>

    <p>He has already thought of a way to enter the teahouse door. After all, he can break the door. Wang Ling no longer needs to worry about many things. What he needs to think about now is how to complete the operation of breaking the door smoothly.</p>

    <p>After all, Jing Heqiu is here to watch him. It would be a bit too arrogant for him to just go up and knock on the door.</p>

    <p>This is not good.</p>

    <p>So after thinking carefully, Wang Ling raised a hand.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu couldn't help laughing when he saw this scene: "Classmate Wang, this trick of yours. If I didn't misjudge it, it should be {Basic Primer Technique}?"</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, Jing Heqiu couldn't help but hold his forehead. He is a professional. And he is also the dean of Jiutian Jingmi Academy. He will not laugh easily...unless he can't help it.</p>

    <p>He could probably guess what Wang Ling was thinking. It was obvious that Wang Ling wanted to use this {{Basic Primer Technique} from the air to manipulate stones or other objects to break down the door, thereby achieving the purpose of entering the Jiutian Teahouse.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu couldn't laugh or cry about this.</p>

    <p>He even felt that Wang Ling was too naive. Wang Ling wants to project objects to achieve impact. How much power could this have?</p>

    <p>Not to mention smashing the door. Even if you hit someone, it won't hurt too much!</p>

    <p>Hey. I don't know what Teng Lao likes about this guy...</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu felt very depressed.</p>

    <p>He was lowering his head and sighing when he suddenly heard a loud bang like an explosion coming from the door of the teahouse...</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu didn't even realize what was happening in front of him. The land in front of the teahouse was already shrouded in smoke and dust after the explosion.</p>

    <p>This...what happened?</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was stunned. He was just distracted. As a result, the door of Jiutian Teahouse exploded...</p>

    <p>What's going on!</p>

    <p>He was simply stunned.</p>

    <p>Also stunned with him were the other school students in front of the teahouse.</p>

    <p>Because they just saw an incredible scene.</p>

    <p>Just a minute ago, in front of everyone, they saw Li Changzhe floating directly into the air, and then crashed into the door of Jiutian Teahouse...</p>

    <p>Use the head hammer to hit the door directly. And it is very powerful. This is in line with Li Changzhe's usual sand sculpture style.</p>

    <p>"Damn it. Did Brother Li hit the door with his head? How strong is his head? Can he break it open?"</p>

    <p>Some high school students made disbelieving noises.</p>

    <p>"Maybe he ate too many crabs. They have more calcium, so his head is harder." Someone said, "But he didn't expect to hit the door with his head. And it was too powerful... Sister Zhang and Senior Brother Qu were earlier The remaining power of the two people's attacks seemed to be absorbed by the teahouse door. Why was it Brother Li's turn? Why did the door just collapse?"</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan was also shocked. He paused and said, "Perhaps the previously absorbed power had not yet had time to be digested. As a result, Li Changzhe hit his head. The power overflowed?"</p>

    <p>"Hiss. I think this statement is a bit far-fetched..." said Zhu Hanyun from Taitan High School.</p>

    <p>"What did you think of?" Gao Tianming, who was subduing the demon, asked.</p>

    <p>"No. I just felt a familiar breath when Brother Li banged his head on the door. But the breath has disappeared now."</p>

    <p>"It seems this is not an illusion. I feel the same way." Gao Tianming nodded deeply.</p>

    <p>Everyone was discussing in front of the fallen gate. There was a lot of discussion.</p>

    <p>And what puzzled everyone was that the moment Li Changzhe's body floated, the expression on his face was obviously horrifying.</p>

    <p>He seemed unprepared. He didn't even have time to ask questions. The next second, he hit the teahouse door directly.</p>

    <p>So now, when Jing Heqiu reacted again, he saw the big explosion in front of the teahouse.</p>

    <p>The door of the teahouse used for testing was blown down.</p>

    <p>And two people disappeared directly from the scene.</p>

    <p>One is Li Changzhe who knocked on the door.</p>

    <p>And the other one is Wang Ling who has been standing beside Jing Heqiu...</p>
