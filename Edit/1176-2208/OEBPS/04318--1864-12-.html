  <h1>Chapter 1864 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gathering wool easily. This is Zhang Zhui's old habit.</p>

    <p>According to the experimental data conducted by senior officials of the Office of Strategic Deception on Zhang Zhui several times before.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui's hands and brain are completely separate.</p>

    <p>In other words, when Zhang Zhui was harvesting wool, seven out of ten times it was purely a "passive skill" that suddenly activated.</p>

    <p>Walking on the street is a good thing. From the street to the end of the street, there will always be some extra things in his pocket that even Zhang Zhui has no impression of.</p>

    <p>Everyone was helpless about this. Although they had tried their best to help Zhang Zhui correct this bad habit, Zhang Zhui still occasionally couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhang's ability to pull things off has always been amazing."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled helplessly: "But if Senior Zhang does this, will it really not affect the trajectory of history?"</p>

    <p>"Absolutely not."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda also laughed: "Today's auction house, Zhang Zhui from the Eternal Period is also present. Even if others find that something is missing, they will eventually think that it was Zhang Zhui from the Eternal Period who did it."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>This is a way for him to blame himself. Wang Ling feels like he will live for a long time.</p>

    <p>The trajectory of history. The inevitability of history...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was hiding in Dongda's body and carefully pondering the above two points. He became increasingly curious about the manipulator behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>He has rarely had the experience of being "arranged" by others in this way.</p>

    <p>Although he felt a little unhappy in his heart, he also had a rare sense of freshness.</p>

    <p>If the other party has such an ability to trick him, does that mean that this person has the strength to fight with him?</p>

    <p>He was very curious.</p>

    <p>What Bai Zhe. What Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>He hasn't paid any attention to these stinky fish and rotten shrimps.</p>

    <p>As a progressive young man under the positive modern social education system, Wang Ling feels that he should be aligned with the longer-term future. And he always has expectations for the future.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to the emergence of someone who can truly let him unlock all the seals and have a hearty fight.</p>

    <p>"Tianzi Room 1. Who is that person? I feel that there is something special."</p>

    <p>In Room 9 opposite, King Tiankun, the representative of the Western Emperor, spoke calmly.</p>

    <p>The snake maid beside him bent over and asked, "Do you want to check your identity?"</p>

    <p>King Tiankun thought for a while, then waved his hand: "That's all. Those who have the financial resources to sit in this private room are not ordinary people. There is no need to deliberately test who the other party is. You can see the real story when the auction starts."</p>

    <p>He stared intently at the private room where Wang Ling and others were, showing some interest.</p>

    <p>Soon the auction started. A young man wearing a black burqa and the auction administrator Ms. Chen Yanan took the stage to preside.</p>

    <p>Such a young man served as the auctioneer of this auction. This surprised many people.</p>

    <p>"You're too young. For such an important auction during the gathering of the Four Emperors, you actually let a stupid young man be the auctioneer?"</p>

    <p>"If the object to be auctioned later is a treasure of heaven and earth, will he faint as soon as he touches it?"</p>

    <p>"Don't underestimate this little brother. His name is Liu Renwen. I heard he is the son of the president of the Central Auction House. He became a saint at the age of 9. He is stronger than many of you here."</p>

    <p>When he spoke, many people immediately fell silent.</p>

    <p>Sanctification of the body at the age of nine...what is this concept?</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this is a genius!</p>

    <p>The identity of the president of the Central Auction House has always been an extremely mysterious existence in the minds of many people.</p>

    <p>But they never thought that the president's son would be so rebellious.</p>

    <p>His son's qualifications are like this. Aren't his talents even more amazing...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is sitting in the VIP room on the upper floor with a panoramic view.</p>

    <p>There are also auction houses like this in modern cultivation society. However, Wang Ling has never been interested in the magic weapons in the auction. None of them can beat the items in his King's Pants.</p>

    <p>"Can I temporarily join the item auction?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>This is not allowed in modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Modern cultivators are very particular about regulations and systems. They require all prepared items to be auctioned to be strictly authenticated and confirmed in advance. It is never allowed to join the auction of objects midway.</p>

    <p>Because doing so will run a huge risk of defective products and counterfeit goods. You must know that it is very difficult to complete the identification of a magic weapon in a very short time.</p>

    <p>This is a great test of the appraiser's ability. Once the appraisal is wrong, defective and fake goods will be sold.</p>

    <p>So in modern society, the vitality of this auction house has come to an end.</p>

    <p>But obviously. In the eternal world.</p>

    <p>Auction houses don't have that many complicated rules.</p>

    <p>After hearing Wang Ying's question, Dongda immediately answered in the team voice: "Of course. But there are requirements for the objects to be auctioned. What do you want to add to participate in the auction?"</p>

    <p>"Won't it affect the historical trajectory?" Wang Ying asked cautiously.</p>

    <p>"No." Dongda shook his head without thinking.</p>

    <p>After receiving the reply, Wang Ying also received instructions from Wang Ling. He continued to communicate with Dongda: "Okay. I will give you something later. Go up and sell it."</p>

    <p>The words had just finished speaking in the private room here. The first item from the auction house had already been brought to the stage.</p>

    <p>It was a very exquisite vessel. It was bowl-shaped. It was completely transparent. It was made of jade-like material. Even its luster was very similar. But it was definitely not an ordinary jade bowl. It was an immortal magic weapon bred from chaos!</p>

    <p>"A natural bowl of all things. A treasure born from chaos! Contains 20% chaos concentration!" Liu Renwen, the bank president's son, wearing white gloves, introduced the origin of this bowl to everyone in a very professional manner.</p>

    <p>He touched it directly with his hands. He was not afraid of the chaos energy seeping out of the chaos device at all.</p>

    <p>With the help of the projection ball magic weapon, the image of the bowl is three-dimensionally enlarged into the air, allowing all participants to see all the details of the bowl clearly.</p>

    <p>"After all, it's Jiaochu who has become a saint in the flesh. To directly reach out and touch the Chaos Device is too strong... Uh. My focus seems to be wrong!"</p>

    <p>"A bowl with 20% chaos concentration. It is indeed rare. But why is it called the Bowl of All Things?"</p>

    <p>Many people are curious.</p>

    <p>Then, Liu Renwen began to introduce the currently known functions in more detail: "After many experiments conducted by our bank, the experimental results show that the All Things Bowl has the effect of replicating."</p>

    <p>"For example, just place a complete elixir in the bowl. After waiting for a period of time, a new elixir will be completely engraved in the bowl."</p>

    <p>"However, the potency of the replica elixir will be reduced. It is only 52% to 78% of the original elixir. And it will consume the chaos concentration of the Bowl of All Things."</p>

    <p>"Chaos concentration can be restored by itself. As long as you are not greedy and don't use too much at one time, you can continue this ability."</p>

    <p>"Of course. If the chaos concentration is directly reduced to 0, the bowl will directly break into pieces."</p>

    <p>The estimates that are accurate to specific figures and the extremely detailed introduction of the magic weapon directly prove the professionalism of the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen's introduction instantly made many cultivators present ready to move.</p>

    <p>It can directly reproduce the elixir...if you put the best natural materials or tonics inside. Once the reproduction is successful, it means that you can absorb more medicinal power!</p>

    <p>And as long as you are not greedy, this bowl is a treasure trove that can be used forever!</p>

    <p>This is undoubtedly a huge temptation for cultivators who have been struggling to seek breakthroughs throughout the ages!</p>
