  <h1>Chapter 1935 Wang Ming's assist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Help Wang Ling cover. In fact, it was Wang Ming's task from the beginning. As for Wang Ling being targeted.</p>

    <p>As an older brother, Wang Ming naturally had a certain degree of vigilance. So from the moment Teng Luchen found him, Wang Ming became suspicious almost immediately.</p>

    <p>Although this old Teng concealed himself very well and left only a few among the thousands of surveillance cameras on WangLing. But because of his intuition of control... Wang Ming was still clearly aware of Tenglu and his special purpose.</p>

    <p>On one side, he wrote the system according to Teng Luchen's instructions. On the other side, he differentiated another brain wave to communicate with Zhai Yin beside him.</p>

    <p>The young couple have been getting along for a while. They work together very well. They immediately started contacting people to prepare for assistance.</p>

    <p>At the same time, as one of the good sisters of Sun Rong, Zhai Yin did not forget to send this news to Sun Rong and also synchronized it.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling was suspected. And the senior's background was extraordinary." After receiving the message, Sun Rong stared at the phone screen, frowning in discomfort.</p>

    <p>"Ah. What should I do? Haven't they been fine for so many years? The secret has never been exposed?" Sun Ying'er asked in surprise.</p>

    <p>"How can I keep my shoes from getting wet when I often walk by the river? Maybe it's because my classmate Wang Ling has participated in too many competitions these days..." Sun Rong guessed.</p>

    <p>Despite these big and small competitions, Wang Ling has tried his best to curb its edge. And basically, the memory has been cleared where the memory should be cleared.</p>

    <p>However, the official game record will not disappear. Even if Wang Ling's contribution to the team is small, his name is still in the official list of the academic administration system.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that maybe it was the official record that left Wang Ling with seeds of doubt in Teng Luchen.</p>

    <p>But it's useless to say all this now. As the saying goes, when soldiers come, they will be blocked. When water comes, soil will cover up. It was at this time that she decided to run Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>And very fortunately, Sun Rong happened to see a familiar name among the ten teams that had entered the spirit world...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the oasis of the Number 1 trial site in the spirit world. Wang Ling can actually feel that Li Changzhe has been pretending to be unconscious. This makes his plan to put the blame on Li Changzhe unable to be implemented.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan accepted the hint very smoothly. Now she has organized a team to make spiritual power banks out of pebbles.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling now has to find a way to get Li Changzhe to stand up.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was still busy. At this time, Wang Ling suddenly saw a female high school student with short ear-length hair, an oval face, and unusually fair skin walking towards him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this person looked familiar. But for a while, he couldn't place his name.</p>

    <p>"Don't you recognize me? Classmate Wang Ling?" Wang Ling was surprised. Unexpectedly, this girl was actually communicating with me in fluent Mandarin.</p>

    <p>Seeing the confused expression on Wang Ling's face, the girl didn't mince words. She directly introduced herself: "I am Rokume Akahoko. I am the one from Jiudaohe High School. My nickname is Ma Jiao."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked.</p>

    <p>If Rokume Akahoko hadn't announced her family name, Wang Ling would not have recognized that it was her.</p>

    <p>This change is too big. But we haven't seen each other for only a few months, right?</p>

    <p>The pockmark on Ma Jiao's face is gone. Her figure is much slimmer than before. And most importantly, she has taken off her glasses.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really couldn't help it. His impression of Ma Jiao was actually still at the stage when he was in high school in Jiudaohe... In his memory, she was a computer expert. She also admired Wang Ming's identity as Old V.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Ling with a puzzled look on his face, Ma Jiao briefly explained: "Don't get me wrong. I'm still a student of Jiudaohe. But this time, I'm playing on Jiudaohe's behalf."</p>

    <p>"Foreign aid?" Wang Ling suddenly spoke. As always, he cherished his words like gold.</p>

    <p>The main reason was that he felt that the girl had said so many things to him in a series, and he seemed to be indifferent to them. It seemed a bit impolite.</p>

    <p>"It can be understood that way. On the other hand, it is also to collect some intelligence. My school uniform is from Baqi High School. It is currently the second-ranked high school on Sun Island." Ma Jiao replied in a low voice.</p>

    <p>Then she glanced at Li Changzhe, who was still lying next to him, pretending to be unconscious. She made a V sign to Wang Ling. Then she started to make lip movements to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>[Old V and the leader asked me to help you]</p>

    <p>Through Ma Jiao's mouth shape, Wang Ling easily read these words.</p>

    <p>Then he saw Ma Jiao take out a stack of golden needles from her pocket and started to perform: "Hey. Classmate Wang Ling. You said that Li Changzhe is not awake yet. Is there congestion in the brain? I just learned some acupuncture. Do you want to give him a couple of injections?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Changzhe's eyelids twitched visibly.</p>

    <p>But he still has no intention of waking up... After all, it is more embarrassing than losing face. It doesn't matter if he gets a few acupuncture needles. As long as he secretly uses his spiritual power to seal his acupuncture points and press the needles of the golden needles, he will not feel too painful.</p>

    <p>But Li Changzhe would never have thought that Ma Jiao was a ruthless person.</p>

    <p>She first pretended to be professional and checked Li Changzhe's pulse. Then she suddenly let out a surprised scream: "Oh my god... he was injured so badly! Sure enough, there was congestion in his brain! Not only was there congestion in his brain. And this congestion will spread! I'm afraid it will spread to the lower body in a few hours..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Ma Jiao retracted the golden needle on the side and sighed: "In this situation, it is useless to use the golden needle. In order to release this congestion, the only way is... to use a knife."</p>

    <p>Quack doctor!</p>

    <p>She is definitely a quack!</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Li Changzhe was heartbroken.</p>

    <p>He was scared. </p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling doesn't know why Ma Jiao has so many props on her body. She is obviously a hacker. But it turns out that she has a lot of props with her.</p>

    <p>He watched eagerly as Ma Jiao took out a kitchen knife from her body. Then Wang Ling was surprised to find that the kitchen knife was actually smart! A keyboard actually appeared on the surface of the kitchen knife!</p>

    <p>After typing the above, Ma Jiao wiped her sweat and said, "Don't worry. Classmate Wang Ling. I'm not a professional. But the program won't lie. And it will be very accurate! It's just a matter of cutting off a small amount, two inches of stuff. No problem at all!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Li Changzhe: "..."</p>

    <p>"I have already programmed this smart kitchen knife. It will start by itself in three minutes. When it is finished cutting, the blood will be blocked directly. You don't have to worry about Mr. Li bleeding profusely. You just need to release the congestion."</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao covered her mouth and pretended to be in pain: "There is nothing I can do. I hope you won't blame me when classmate Li wakes up. After all, this is all to save his life..."</p>

    <p>I have to say, Ma Jiao's acting is really real. Even Wang Ling believed it after watching it.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Li Changzhe still had no intention of waking up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Li Changzhe was very likely to know it. Ma Jiao was irritating him. He bet that Ma Jiao's smart kitchen knife would not really work.</p>

    <p>But what neither Wang Ling nor Li Changzhe expected was.</p>

    <p>Just three minutes later, the kitchen knife actually flew...</p>
