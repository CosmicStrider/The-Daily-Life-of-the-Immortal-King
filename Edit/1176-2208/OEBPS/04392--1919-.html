  <h1>Chapter 1919 Genius Girl Su Xingyue</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Guo Hao's voice made Wang Ling excited. Wang Ling never realized that this guy's voice could be so loud.</p>

    <p>Now it was better, and the whole class began to focus on Wang Ling. Everyone showed extremely surprised and incredible looks.</p>

    <p>"Excellent, Lingzi. I see that your scores in each subject have not improved much. They are only five or six points higher than the usual average. Why did you rise to the top of the list?" Su Xiao also showed surprised eyes. This is the first time that Wang Ling has surpassed him as a study committee member in the ranking list. It is simply an epoch-making day.</p>

    <p>"Good guy. It seems that he performed exceptionally this time. I thought that usually Lingzi was deliberately trying to score low points." Chen Chao once again said it unintentionally. It made Wang Ling want to throw a blackboard eraser at his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Don't think too much, everyone. The difficulty is higher this time. Classmate Wang Ling's grades have always been relatively stable. This shows his advantage. It's normal to get first place once. After all, he is still classmate Wang Ling." Sun Rong couldn't stand it any longer. She came out to smooth things over. Wang Ling immediately gave her a grateful look.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he knew something was up. His eyelids kept twitching last night...</p>

    <p>"Everyone, look out the window!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong shouted again, making everyone's attention loosen from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his head and followed Sun Rong's gaze. Through the window of the teaching building, the early morning sunshine just shined through the clouds in front of the gate of Number 60 High School. It was spread out like a golden carpet.</p>

    <p>An ancient-style girl wearing a fire-patterned Hanfu and long hair shawl slowly walked in from the door.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone's attention was attracted at this moment. Chen Chao rubbed his eyes and felt that this girl looked particularly familiar. He subconsciously took out his phone and searched for something.</p>

    <p>Then everyone was shocked: "Isn't this Su Xingyue! Su Xingyue from Shengke!"</p>

    <p>"That alchemy genius girl? One of the top names in Shengke?" Everyone followed and were stunned. They couldn't believe that Su Xingyue, who had just won the gold medal in the International Alchemy Open abroad, would appear at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>It seems that the news may actually be delayed due to time difference. In other words, Su Xingyue came to Number 60 High School immediately after winning the award.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Class 1 and 3. After discovering Su Xingyue's arrival, almost all the students in the teaching building were excited. This was the first time everyone saw Su Xingyue's Zhenren. It made people feel unrealistic and unreal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling would not have thought that Su Xingyue's arrival would be so lethal. In just a moment, everyone in the classroom had disappeared. They all went to the corridor to watch Su Xingyue. Only the remaining Wang Ling, Sun Rong and several core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled bitterly. Looking at Wang Ling: "Classmate Wang Ling. It seems that my attraction has been temporarily suppressed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi touched his chin: "It seems like something big is going to happen this time. You have to prepare in advance. When Su Xingyue was thirteen years old, she almost won the match. But at that time, she underestimated the enemy. Now, she has won the championship in the junior category of the International Alchemy Open. Su Xingyue must be stronger than before."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "No matter what, let's take one step at a time. Whoever comes here is not a good person."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi narrowed his eyes and said with a smile: "Look at the way the other person walked into this school. She didn't regard Number 60 High School as an external school at all. It was like stepping into the back garden. The confidence exuding from her whole body. I'm afraid that in the first place In the eyes of the students of the college, we are the ones here."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Do those two seniors know the purpose of the people from Shengke coming to Number 60 High School?</p>

    <p>Both of them shook their heads quickly.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Absolutely no one would know better than Zhuo Yi about the cultivation of education. Even Zhuo Yi doesn't know about it. It means that this visit from Shengke did not go through any reporting. They came directly to the door."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal said: "There is no need to worry. The truth will come out sooner or later. Senior Jin Deng is also there, isn't he? And he is now the vice principal. He must know something about it. It's better to wait for news about him."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first class in the morning was Lao Gudong's history class. It seems that Lao Gudong is also a teacher in the school's Academic Affairs Office. He knows a lot of inside information. However, after someone in the class asked questions about this Shengke matter, Lao Gudong actually brushed it off.</p>

    <p>"Ahem. Everyone will know it by then. Let's teach quietly first." Lao Gudong cleared his throat and said, "Today's teaching content is about expanding knowledge about the inner earth world."</p>

    <p>"We all know that there is actually a huge inner earth world inside the earth. There are many powerful spiritual beasts and rare spiritual plants that do not exist on the surface of the earth. There are even those hidden in the earth's center that have been buried far beyond the reach of modern cultivation technology..."</p>

    <p>"However. Even after the earth is upgraded, human cultivators still cannot directly reach the inner earth world through existing technical means. And no one knows what kind of dangers they may encounter in the inner earth world."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps in the near future, when the entrance to the inner earth world is completely opened and the technology is fully mature, human cultivators can carry out tourism and resource collection in the inner earth world in an orderly manner. They can even organize and dispatch teaching activities in an orderly manner. All go to the inner world to complete the secret adventure."</p>

    <p>"Just like last time we went to the Beast King's ruins. However, the unknown risks in the inner earth world are much greater than those in the Beast King's ruins..."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Sun Rong was about to raise her hand to ask a question. Suddenly, Teacher Pan suddenly stepped into the classroom. Although Teacher Pan usually has the problem of suddenly calling people out during class, she looked so hurried. Like this is the first time meeting.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, also the classmates in the back row. Come out with me."</p>

    <p>In the back row of the classroom, everyone looked at each other. Even Wang Ling was a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>With Lao Gudong nodding, Wang Ling followed the others and stood up. They lined up in an orderly column at the door of the classroom. Under the leadership of Teacher Pan, they went straight to the principal's office.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the principal's office, Su Xingyue was sitting there, quietly sipping tea.</p>

    <p>After everyone arrived, Principal Chen immediately stood up from his chair and introduced to Su Xingyue: "Student Su Xingyue, let me introduce to you. Now, the few people standing in front of you are the students who have passed the monthly exam this time. Elites with top scores on the big list."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, classmate Gu Shunzhi, classmate Zhenyuan (Zhenyuan), classmate Wang Zhen, classmate Liu Qingyi, classmate Chen Chao, classmate Guo Hao, classmate Fang Xing, and this guy who doesn't seem to be awake Classmate Wang Ling..."</p>
