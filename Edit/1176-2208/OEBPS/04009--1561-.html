  <h1>Chapter 1561 Zhou Ziyi's Legs</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>It was a very old-fashioned house. But after careful observation, both Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi found that the layout inside was very orderly.</p>

    <p>The flowers and plants in the courtyard are growing extremely well. Each of them blooms with their floral fragrance to show their beauty.</p>

    <p>It is obvious that they are taken very good care of every day.</p>

    <p>"Do you usually take care of these flowers and plants?" Zhuo Yi looked at the blooming flowers and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Yes. It was also a task assigned to me by my father before he went to Sun Island. He only has these hobbies. He is so busy outside because of my affairs. I don't dare to feed his things to death."</p>

    <p>"You and your father have such a good relationship."Zhuo Yi sighed: "I thought you would hate your father."</p>

    <p>"Why should I hate my father?" Zhou Ziyi laughed: "It was not his fault that my leg was broken. It was just an accident. He has been running around for my leg all these years. I have seen it all."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Zhou Ziyi suddenly turned around and glanced at Zhuo Yi: "By the way! I want to ask. Are you really Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Zhou Ziyi suddenly turned around and glanced at Zhuo Yi: "By the way! I want to ask, are you really Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>"No. It's nothing..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi quickly turned around and continued to use his arms and palms to replace his legs. He led the person into the front of the main hall.</p>

    <p>Before entering the door, Zhou Ziyi paused: "Wait a minute, I won't go in! I'll let you in before you come in!"</p>

    <p>"You are an old man. What else is shameful about you?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly laughed again. Before coming here, he had already learned about Zhou Ziyi's situation.</p>

    <p>I also know what it is that makes Zhou Ziyi feel nervous and wants to hide it.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's face turned red. She couldn't help but step back.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is a little fan of Zhuo Yi. And he is the kind of person that he has admired for a long time.</p>

    <p>Ever since he lost his legs in an accident when he was very young, the story of Zhuo Yi has become all his hope for success.</p>

    <p>Now that I see this deity appearing, I am of course filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi never dreamed that Zhuo Yi would pay attention to herself.</p>

    <p>"Nothing to be embarrassed about. These are all men."</p>

    <p>Squatting down. Zhuo Yi pinched Zhou Ziyi's dark face.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the little guy's face was as solid as he imagined.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at this scene and felt a little uncomfortable in his heart.</p>

    <p>But when I thought about Zhou Ziyi's current situation, I still endured it.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she also felt naive about her own thoughts.</p>

    <p>The object of my aid is still my little fan. This fact makes people feel that Zhou Ziyi is very cute.</p>

    <p>The key is. Zhou Ziyi is a man.</p>

    <p>She was actually upset about a boy just now?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiugong Liangzi's heart was extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>She didn't think her thoughts were "jealous." Rather, she was simply sick...</p>

    <p>It's all because I have been too close to Zhuo Yi these days. It has led her astray!</p>

    <p>"Then come in... but don't laugh at me!" Zhou Ziyi thought carefully. He felt that what Zhuo Yi said made sense, so he boldly stepped aside.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi pushed open the door and entered the living room of the Zhou family's residence, the scene in front of him instantly stunned him.</p>

    <p>The entire living room. The right half of the wall is filled with carefully cut news newspapers. All of them are news related to him!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi I thought the oldest news would be from six years ago when he defeated Tuntian Ha...</p>

    <p>But in fact, Zhou Ziyi paid attention to his timeline for longer than this.</p>

    <p>Even the news that he received second-class and third-class merit in the army. Zhou Ziyi actually paid attention to it.</p>

    <p>The wall on the right has many posters about Zhuo Yi. There are promotional posters, magazine covers and some movie posters that Zhuo Yi has starred in after becoming famous.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most outrageous thing is not what is on the left and right walls.</p>

    <p>It's the altar table at the front of the main hall...</p>

    <p>The person on the altar table is none other than Zhuo Yi's gold-plated commemorative figure of the Cultivation Hero.</p>

    <p>There are three electronic candles placed on the left and right doves of the figure.</p>

    <p>In front of the figures, there are piles of tributes. There are peaches, bananas, and a whole braised pig head...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at this scene and tried not to laugh out loud.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was being provided for at home. This was something she had not expected at all.</p>

    <p>"Are you happy? Are you touched?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi now wants to ask Zhuo Yi this question.</p>

    <p>She was an outsider. Naturally, she only found it funny.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi is different.</p>

    <p>To be honest, when he saw all this, he was deeply touched in his heart.</p>

    <p>A child who lost his legs at a very young age was not defeated by such an ordeal. Instead, he was able to live a brave and optimistic life.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Zhuo Yi feels that Zhou Ziyi possesses a kind of courage that ordinary children do not have.</p>

    <p>Just like him six years ago, he still showed his spiritual sword and rushed to the front line even though he knew he was outmatched.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought he would laugh out loud. But in fact, after seeing all this, he was moved and more respectful.</p>

    <p>He stepped forward in a few steps, took the incense on the table, and lit it with the spiritual flames separated by his fingertips. Then he bowed to his figure. Then with infinite emotion in his heart, he firmly inserted the three incense sticks. On the incense burner.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jiugong Liangzi and Zhou Ziyi completely unable to bear it.</p>

    <p>The two of them burst into laughter in unison.</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>Zhuo Yi rolled his eyes. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry: "You told me not to laugh. You actually smile brightly."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi wiped his tears: "This... Mr. Zhuo, you can't blame me! I do respect you! But how can you worship yourself! This is too funny!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi lifted Zhou Ziyi with one hand. He straightened Zhou Ziyi as if he was carrying a little chicken, and then directly lifted him up.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's face turned red instantly: "Mr. Zhuo, please put me down quickly..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi neatly placed the boy on his shoulder on the chair next to him. Immediately, he and Jiugong Liangzi found chairs and sat down.</p>

    <p>The person he had admired for a long time was suddenly picked up and placed on a chair. Zhou Ziyi had a feeling that he had no reaction until he landed on the chair.</p>

    <p>He has no shortage of care, because he knows that his father is the person who cares about him the most in this world.</p>

    <p>Although Zhou Xiang works abroad all year round.</p>

    <p>But their father and son's hearts have always been connected.</p>

    <p>He worked hard to learn to be well-behaved and strong. He lived a positive life even without legs.</p>

    <p>But at the moment when Zhuo Yi just picked him up.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt that there was a very powerful backer behind him.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo..." Zhou Ziyi had mixed feelings. She was also very excited. She didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi stared at Zhou Ziyi. He smiled and said, "Don't call me Mr. Zhuo. It's weird. You are a student of Jian Shen College. Speaking of which, I am also your senior."</p>

    <p>"Senior?"</p>

    <p>"When I was studying at Number 60 High School, I was fortunate enough to study at Jian Shen Academy for a while. But that was a long time ago." Zhuo Yi said: "From now on, you can just call me senior."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's eyes lit up. His face was filled with happiness: "Good senior!"</p>

    <p>"Next let's talk about your legs." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"My dad said, you can install the latest smart prosthesis for me. Is this true? That thing is so valuable... It is said that one costs 100 million."</p>

    <p>"Hundreds of millions of smart prosthetics?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi raised his eyebrows. He sighed and said, "I think your father may have misunderstood something."</p>

    <p>"Let me just say... my dad thinks too much. One hundred million legs per leg. It's not my turn." Zhou Ziyi showed a somewhat bitter smile.</p>

    <p>"No, classmate Zhou. Why don't you understand yet?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi said: "Although smart prosthetics are good, they are actually not as useful as real legs."</p>

    <p>"This... could it be a real leg transplant..." Zhou Ziyi was shocked: "But the doctor has already said that my leg has passed the best period for transplantation."</p>
    
    <p>"Transplantation is too low. I can also do this surgery. If you want a transplant, I can help you become Urgot. A few more legs will be fine."</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(League of Legends champion with multiple mechanical legs.)</dfn><p>"..." .</p>

    

    <p>"What I'm talking to you about now is not a prosthetic limb, let alone a so-called transplant."</p>

  <p>At this time Zhuo Yi raised his head and stared at the young man in front of him seriously: "Let your legs grow back! Have you seen the flowers and plants in your yard? This broken leg can also be planted. of."</p></div>
