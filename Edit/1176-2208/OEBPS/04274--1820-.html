  <h1>Chapter 1820 Wang Ling's chess game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>King's Eyes' ability to remove the fake and preserve the real is amazing.</p>

    <p>After stripping away all the beauty and beauty effects, Meng Liuli couldn't even accept her ugly appearance.</p>

    <p>As an eternal person, all the postures after aging are concentratedly reflected in Meng Liuli at this moment. It is like entering the twilight years and growing old.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling could clearly feel that Meng Liuli was autistic. She held her head and squatted directly in the void, looking very painful.</p>

    <p>At this point, the three Eternals assigned by Madam Lawen have all been dealt with.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Wang Ling feels like it's not fun enough. There's a sense of emptiness.</p>

    <p>But if you think about it carefully, the gains this time are not small. At least three Eternals of royal blood have become pawns in his subsequent layout.</p>

    <p>All that's left is to wait until the Holy King behind him can't restrain himself and take action.</p>

    <p>This is the final boss level character.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling is currently unclear about the connection between this holy king and Bai Zhe. But from the current point of view, the two parties are not the same force.</p>

    <p>The resources of the Eternals controlled by the Holy King are incredible. The trump card in his hand goes far beyond the three royal families currently trapped in his King's Eyes space.</p>

    <p>Before all the trump cards are revealed, I'm afraid he won't show up so easily.</p>

    <p>In this case. Wang Ling thinks it might as well be a comparison of trump cards.</p>

    <p>The trump cards held by the Holy King were collected through constant lobbying.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is different.</p>

    <p>He can always have more trump cards whenever he wants.</p>

    <p>Even when there is just no trump card.</p>

    <p>He can also create trump cards.</p>

    <p>"Next, leave it to me." At this time, Wang Ying appeared. He materialized directly from a group of black shadows. His white hair, and his face that seemed to move out of sight, made it clear to the three eternal members of the royal family here.</p>

    <p>"Um."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. He took over the baton from Wang Ying. Then he voluntarily evacuated from the King's Eyes space.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Skeleton Prince, the Lion-headed Man and Meng Liuli were staring at Wang Ying who suddenly appeared. The fear in their minds could not help but come up again.</p>

    <p>They have an intuition.</p>

    <p>That's the white-haired boy in front of me. Compared to the black-haired boy just now... he's even more difficult to deal with!</p>

    <p>He is a ruthless character who is not easy to negotiate with.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, stop it. Don't use breaking the shield as an excuse. You don't want to break the shield at all. You just want to survive. If my master wanted to destroy you, how could my master waste so much time?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying crossed his arms and said with a sinister smile: "Don't worry. I'm much easier to talk to than my master. As long as you are willing to surrender, I won't do anything to you."</p>

    <p>"We are a royal family... how is it possible..." the lion-headed man said first. He wanted to curse loudly, but he swallowed it when the words reached his mouth. He did not dare to shout like this in front of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>He could see that Wang Ying was a ruthless character. If he was not careful, he would be killed.</p>

    <p>"But you are not serving the Holy King behind you now? As a royal family, you have no dignity to talk about." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Then this is a contract! The three of us are all the same." At this time, the Skeleton Prince couldn't help but interrupt and said: "We just abide by the cooperative relationship of the contract. There is no distinction between superior and inferior!"</p>

    <p>"That's just the boss's workplace PUA." Wang Ying laughed immediately after hearing this.</p>

    <p>Although it has been determined that the Holy King's forces have nothing to do with Bai Zhe, the method of deceiving his subordinates into working for him is surprisingly similar.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe used the same rhetoric when he commanded the dragonborn headed by Jingze.</p>

    <p>It sounds shameless to outsiders.</p>

    <p>However, this method can retain those employees who have successfully been left out of the pie.</p>

    <p>These are all normal operations in business management.</p>

    <p>It's commonplace in the eyes of capitalists.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's business model is different. Because there are so many things in his King's Pants, the things he can promise are by no means a pie-in-the-sky pie. Nor will they create bourgeois antagonism and exploitation.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's ultimate goal is exactly what was originally envisioned.</p>

    <p>Create a Utopia of Eternals in the Supreme Corpse Map. Everyone will be divided according to their contribution to the world. The big ball will drive the small ball. Let some areas become rich first... and ultimately achieve common prosperity.</p>

    <p>A smart person can understand the choice between the tangible and generous rewards that can be seen and the illusory pie.</p>

    <p>So. When Wang Ying proposed the idea of asking the Skeleton Prince, the Lion-headed Man and Meng Liuli to build the world of the Eternal Ones, the eyes of the three people suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>An expression that actually works like this.</p>

    <p>Build a utopia that is completely united by the Eternals. This is the vision that the three royal families once aspired to. The key is to ensure sufficient resources. You can get visible rewards based on your contribution alone. Almost all you have to do is immerse yourself in the construction. Just your own homeland is enough. There is no need to engage in various tribal wars for resources like in the past.</p>

    <p>When everyone becomes rich, in the end it will be a perfect communist society!</p>

    <p>"Although your idea is wonderful, but... whether it can really be realized is also a question. Anyone can make a pie-in-the-sky argument," the Skeleton Prince said.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying nodded slightly. He stared at the people in front of him with a very serious expression: "So, do you want to go and take a look?"</p>

    <p>"What are you looking at?"</p>

    <p>"King's Pants."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said confidently: "That is the gathering place of resources in the entire universe. No one has a stronger foundation than the Lord."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After leaving the King's Eyes space, Wang Ling resumed the flow of time. At the same time, he also realized that it was time to solve the problem at hand. Continuing to waste time in this secret room seemed to be of no use.</p>

    <p>Even Sun Rong herself didn't expect it. It was just a blink of an eye. Wang Ling had already eliminated three royal-level Eternals.</p>

    <p>She had some doubts in her heart. It was a sixth sense. She felt as if she had missed something during the time she buried her face in her knees.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Sun Rong has a vague intuition. It feels like there is something outside of her body that is always pushing against her.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling secretly looked at Sun Rong with his peripheral vision. He was shocked to find that... the finger bone from the Skeleton Prince was still drilling into Sun Rong's shield!</p>

    <p>Wipe!</p>

    <p>How dedicated are they to breaking shields!</p>

    <p>Didn't Wang Ying take them to visit King's Pants? Why are they still here to break the shield?</p>

    <p>At this time, the corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. He didn't know how to explain this to Sun Rong. He just looked at the invisible finger bone left by the Skeleton Prince in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"Wang... Ling?" She saw Wang Ling looking at her strangely. Sun Rong's eyes showed a trace of confusion.</p>

    <p>She suddenly raised her head. As a result, the phalanges that were drilling through the shield slipped out very smoothly with the change of Sun Rong's posture. The door of the secret room in front of her was broken into pieces on the spot...</p>

    <p>"What the hell? Why did classmates Wang and Sun stay in the same room, and suddenly there was a hole?" In the studio, several photographers stared at the images from the monitor. Their expressions twitched, and their faces were shocked.</p>
