  <h1>Chapter 1476 An ancient cultural street with hidden murderous intent</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Due to the fact that Zhuo Yi had spent some time in the Importal Police Special Operations Unit at the basic level. At that time Zhuo Yi was just an ordinary junior officer.</p>

    <p>However, valuable learning experience has been accumulated.</p>

    <p>Those grassroots immortal police officers are generally not directly assigned to participate in dangerous charge missions. Instead, priority is given to medical soldiers.</p>

    <p>Before Zhuo Yi was officially called to the front line, she was also the "son of the stars" in the army. She had an amazing amount of milk.</p>

    <p>He was able to perform first-aid reconnections on broken arms and legs. It was even said that it was just a sprained foot.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi carefully explored the painful area of Jiugong Liangzi. He used his fingers to move it little by little.</p>

    <p>When he touched the core area of pain, he clearly felt that the girl suddenly twitched in pain. This was a conditioned reflex.</p>

    <p>"Is this here..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked focused. A stream of dark blue spiritual power separated from his fingertips.</p>

    <p>Then, an icy force penetrated into the skin of the girl's ankle. It penetrated bit by bit.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was secretly grateful. Fortunately, the situation was not too serious.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan, he wanted to find Jiugong Liangzi and knock on the door of his room, then follow the trend and go to the ancient streets.</p>

    <p>Previously, he saw the "Izumo Flying to the Moon Hanfu Photo" that Wang Ling sent him privately.</p>

    <p>His master is so handsome!</p>

    <p>Seeing Zhuo Yi felt itchy in my heart.</p>

    <p>So. Zhuo Yi began to fantasize about Jiugong Liangzi wearing Hanfu.</p>

    <p>And now, while helping Jiugong Liangzi's treatment, Zhuo Yi was shocked to discover.</p>

    <p>The deepest routine in the world is that there is no routine.</p>

    <p>Feelings are a very mysterious thing.</p>

    <p>When your heart is trapped by someone from the beginning, you are already on the passive side.</p>

    <p>And emotionally passive.</p>

    <p>It is often the hardest.</p>

    <p>So when Zhuo Yi found out that he fell in love with Jiugong Liangzi, he immediately felt how difficult it was for Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking about it, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly asked an off-topic question: "Isn't your relationship with Sun Rong very good?"</p>

    <p>This may sound like nothing at first. But to Zhuo Yi, it sounds a bit like the kind of question about the desire to survive test...</p>

    <p>"Why do you ask this question so suddenly?" He stared at Jiugong Liangzi's feet intently and tried to stay calm as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"I see that you are quite skilled in healing spells. I am reminded of a piece of news and gossip from a while ago."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "I remember that Miss Sun suddenly fell into a coma for no reason for a while?"</p>

    <p>"That's true." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then those gossipy self-media reports said that when she passed out, you seemed to be particularly interested. You went there several times in a row and suspected that you two were in a relationship." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi burst out laughing on the spot after listening to it.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, these gossip marketing accounts are really outrageous.</p>

    <p>How dare he fall in love with "Master's Wife"...</p>

    <p>He wouldn't dare to do that, even if I gave him a million dares.</p>

    <p>"Judging from your reaction, it seems that there is no relationship between you?" Somehow, Jiugong Liangzi felt that his mood suddenly improved.</p>

    <p>She has been observing. Zhuo Yi's first reaction.</p>

    <p>Usually the first reaction is difficult to fake.</p>

    <p>And there are no other micro-expressions on Zhuo Yi's face.</p>

    <p>In Jiugong Liangzi's view, this reaction is very real.</p>

    <p>"She is just my school girl. And I have received a lot of care from Mr. Boss Sun before. The general election of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance is coming soon. Do you understand?" Zhuo Yi smiled. That was all he could say.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is not stupid.</p>

    <p>Judging from the literal meaning of Zhuo Yi, the reason why he is so interested in Sun Rong is to repay Boss Sun's favor. On the other hand, it is also for the general election. He wants to win votes.</p>

    <p>This reason is impeccable. There is no loophole.</p>

    <p>After several conversations, the girl discovered that the man in front of her was the man who was portrayed as a "liar" in Jiugong's family.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly very candid.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Zhuo Yi doesn't need to explain it to her so clearly...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was confused. She crossed her arms and stared at Zhuo Yi: "Now I am also your school girl. Do you treat all school girls like this?"</p>

    <p>"I won't go out to heal some schoolgirl's injuries."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shrugged helplessly. Then he pinched the girl's most painful spot.</p>

    <p>The previous severe pain from the sprain has completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Mission accomplished. Zhuo Yi stood up.</p>

    <p>"Are you leaving now?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi also got up from the ground. He looked at the back of Zhuo Yi. There was a bit of sincerity in her eyes.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi turned his face slightly. With only his peripheral vision, he could see the four words "want to go out" written all over the girl's face.</p>

    <p>"What? You want me to stay?"</p>

    <p>"I don't want to..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed. In the end, he followed the girl's advice: "It will be evening soon. I remember there is a fountain show in the center of the ancient street in the evening. Do you want to go and see it together?"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to go with you? Even if I want to go, I will go alone."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi snorted. She took off Zhuo Yi's suit jacket from the hanger and put it on her body. Then she put on her shoes and walked out of the room: "And you, you only need to fulfill your duties as a bodyguard. Not far away. Just protect me."</p>

    <p>Behind him. The corners of Zhuo Yi's mouth raised crazily.</p>

    <p>Having said so much...</p>

    <p>It's not like you have to accompany yourself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the cold weapon shop, Jiang Yingying was lying on the mat covered in sweat.</p>

    <p>She felt that her arms no longer belonged to her at all.</p>

    <p>Even the makeup on his face is gone. The wig has fallen off.</p>

    <p>These are the disguises that Jiang Yingying spent a long time in the morning.</p>

    <p>At this point, he disappeared completely, revealing Jiang Yingying's true appearance...</p>

    <p>From the morning of throwing until now, the girl has tried her best. The highest record is 892 meters.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this record is actually amazing.</p>

    <p>The store manager was sweating secretly.</p>

    <p>She's the granddaughter of the Sage of Martial Arts.</p>

    <p>Although the distance is 892 meters, there is still a big gap from the first prize.</p>

    <p>But if all these small prizes are cashed in, the cost of participating in the Stone Spear Throwing activity will have been fully earned, and there will still be a little surplus.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that Jiang Yingying doesn't know why. He hasn't finished voting yet...</p>

    <p>"Ms. Jiang, you still have 19 throwing opportunities left. I think Miss Jiang's physical strength has reached its limit today. Why don't you save it first? Will you throw next time?"</p>

    <p>At this point in time, the manager of the Cold Weapons Store has completed his mission.</p>

    <p>Through precise operation, he used his own way to keep Jiang Yingying in the store.</p>

    <p>"It turns out you can save it... You didn't tell me earlier!" the girl complained. She had wanted to leave for a long time. But she didn't expect that there was a save function!</p>

    <p>"We were negligent. Miss Jiang."</p>

    <p>The store manager smiled slightly. Then he took out two special coupons and handed them to Jiang Yingying: "This is additional compensation."</p>

    <p>"You won't give me more times..."</p>

    <p>"Absolutely not." The store manager said, "This is a coupon for a luxury single suite at Holiday Inn Gujie. With the coupon, you can enjoy one night's hotel accommodation for free. In addition, all entertainment facilities and beauty treatments in the hotel are free for a limited time. single."</p>

    <p>"But why...two single suites?"</p>

    <p>"This hotel is the most popular. The double suite has been fully booked. We apologize for the inconvenience to you two." The store manager said with a smile.</p>

    <p>These two coupons were prepared for him by Jiang Xiaoche. He was asked to give them to the girl after the event.</p>

    <p>And you will find out after Jiang Yingying goes.</p>

    <p>These are two deluxe single suites.</p>

    <p>One on the first floor, one on the fourth floor...</p>

    <p>They are two rooms that are not even close to each other.</p>

    <p>"Thank you very much!" Jiang Yingying thanked him.</p>

    <p>"Ms. Jiang, walk slowly. Welcome to come again next time..."</p>

    <p>This was a free bargain. It made her feel good.</p>

    <p>Although it looks like I spent a lot of money today, in reality, it doesn't seem like I was at a huge loss...</p>

    <p>And when I followed Wei Zhi and left the Cold Weapons Store, I realized that it was almost evening!</p>

    <p>"Oops Wang Ling..." Jiang Yingying held his forehead.</p>

    <p>She was busy competing with Sun Rong. She completely left the matter of following Wang Ling to Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"You are too tired today. Go to bed early. This hotel coupon is in vain if you don't use it."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Jiang Yingying smiled and said, "Hey. It's really troublesome for Brother Zhi. You stayed with me all day!"</p>

    <p>"What the hell." Wei Zhi shook his head.</p>

    <p>The two of them were walking side by side on their way to the hotel.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiang Yingying didn't notice at all that there was a man wearing a plaid shirt following her secretly behind her.</p>

    <p>After seeing Jiang Yingying leave the cold weapons store, the man followed him and reported the situation using the micro communication device: "The target has been confirmed..."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure it's Miss Sun herself?"</p>

    <p>"It's definitely her."</p>

    <p>The man nodded: "She just left this cold weapon shop. So there is no mistake."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Then... just follow the original plan."</p>
