  <h1>Chapter 1437 Your World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time. In the core world of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked around. Number 60 High School here is like an isolated island in this huge world. At first glance, it seems a little deserted.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. The school has obviously been renovated and renovated.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School here still maintains the appearance of the old school. There are dilapidated stone carvings at the main entrance. There are also palm trees next to the teaching building that are in decline but still standing.</p>

    <p>Everything feels very familiar.</p>

    <p>The results of the battle between Wang Ling and Peng Xiren were played in real time on the screen in the school square.</p>

    <p>The girl was sitting on a bench under the tree. From this angle, she could just see the big screen.</p>

    <p>When he saw Wang Ling whose hair was permed by Peng Xiren, Sun Rong couldn't help but feel a little red on his face.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, an idea arose in her mind. Somehow, she wanted to rub Wang Ling's hair.</p>

    <p>The curly-haired classmate Wang Ling. is also very cute!</p>

    <p>"Want to go in and have a look?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>He has been with Sun Rong throughout the whole process. However, it will not affect Wang Ying's actual battle in the Sword King Realm. Because what is accompanying Sun Rong now is just a split body.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Can I go in?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>During the entire battle, she had been sitting obediently on the bench, staring intently at the various battle scenes on the screen.</p>

    <p>I seem to be afraid of missing any details.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you always worried about whether the Lord can beat him? When the cannon version of the Galaxy Punch hit him, I saw you clenching your skirt nervously."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying couldn't help laughing: "You should feel relieved about the current situation. Why don't you go inside and have a look."</p>

    <p>"Where...where is there..." Sun Rong's face was hot at the question.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying couldn't help laughing at this naive reaction: "Forget it. I won't tease you anymore. It's boring to tease you. It's far less interesting than Ying'er."</p>

    <p>Sun RongCurious: "Why do you keep treating Ying'er..."</p>

    <p>"She will resist and struggle. The more she resists, the more excited I get. You are too soft. You are not the same as Ying'er at all. It's boring." Wang Ying replied.</p>

    <p>Although he is just a split body, there is no essential difference between the split body and the original body. The thoughts in his head are all carved from the same mold.</p>

    <p>"But that's not right! Why do you act like you understand so well...you are all just shadows?" Sun Rong asked the question he had always wanted to ask.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying and Sun Ying'er are essentially their shadows. Sun Rong feels that both of them are a bit too mature...</p>

    <p>"Those void creatures have been alive for too long. And she is the Lord of the Void. With the memory shared by all void creatures, it is normal for her to become a veteran."</p>

    <p>"What about you, Master of Shadows..."</p>

    <p>"Didn't I absorb her ability? I don't want to do this either." Wang Ying spread his hands: "Is it my fault?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl looked at the teaching building in front: "The layout inside is the same as that of the 60-year-old school..."</p>

    <p>"Go and take a look. Then you'll know, right?" Wang Ying hesitated.</p>

    <p>In this entire core world, why is there only one sixty-year-old school left?</p>

    <p>Wang Ying can actually guess it just by guessing.</p>

    <p>The summary of Wang Ling is that he is lazy. He is too lazy to re-model.</p>

    <p>If there were infrastructure madmen like Zhenyuan Immortal who were keen on creating "Minecraft", the core world would definitely be built perfectly.</p>

    <p>However, in Wang Ying's view, this conclusion is purely an excuse.</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>His master is too dull.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, Ying'er is right. You are a bad guy." Sun Rong stood up and straightened out his skirt and messy thoughts.</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Wang Ying beside him and nodded: "Then... let's go and have a look..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling reckons it's almost time. It's been some time since Peng Xiren escaped.</p>

    <p>The opponent's movement was extremely fast. It had already covered a distance of almost 10 billion light years.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren won't you leave yet?" the monk asked from the side.</p>

    <p>To be honest, the distance is a bit too big. He feels that it may be difficult to catch up now...at least for himself. I'm afraid he won't be able to catch up. But after all, the person Peng Xiren is dealing with is Wang Ling. The monk is still worried about this. Have some expectations.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling. really did not disappoint the monk.</p>

    <p>I saw the young man in front of me suddenly spread his five fingers with distinct knuckles and grabbed them in one direction.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was like the messenger who unveiled the universe.</p>

    <p>There was brilliant light condensed in that palm. An immortal aura emanated from it.</p>

    <p>The monk looked at this scene in surprise. He saw the light condensed in Wang Ling's palm. He was amazed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Chaos calamity light...</p>

    <p>This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the energy is too huge and resonates with chaos. It is essentially a self-defense mechanism in the universe.</p>

    <p>After the Chaos Tribulation Light appears, it will collide with something with too much energy to offset it.</p>

    <p>But obviously, there is no way to erase Wang Ling from the Chaos Tribulation Light.</p>

    <p>Instead, these chaotic tribulations that appeared were manipulated by Wang Ling at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Using naturally generated chaotic light to build a tunnel spanning tens of billions of light years..." The monk was extremely surprised. He didn't expect such a miraculous operation to exist.</p>

    <p>Because under normal circumstances, ordinary psychic energy cannot complete such a large project of building a tens of billions of light years tunnel.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling. actually used his own spiritual energy to stimulate the universe to produce self-defense "chaos tribulation light." He then used this chaotic tribulation light for his own use.</p>

    <p>It's just the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just raised his hand. The channel has been established.</p>

    <p>Then, he moved and stepped directly into the tunnel ahead.</p>

    <p>The monk followed closely behind. He couldn't wait to see what would happen next.</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren, who thought he had escaped far away, felt very proud.</p>

    <p>Hehe!</p>

    <p>He estimated that he had opened a distance of more than 10 billion light years. Moreover, all the auras on his body were demonstrated perfectly under the cover of starlight.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether Wang Ling is still a monk. No matter how powerful he is, there is no way he can get into trouble.</p>

    <p>Next, as long as he sends back the Rubik's Cube in his hand, the mission will be successfully completed.</p>

    <p>However, Peng Xiren is not without doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that his mission seemed a little too smooth.</p>

    <p>Could it be said that the Rubik's Cube is a fraud?</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren frowned. He was about to take out the Rubik's Cube and check it carefully.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, he suddenly felt a great sense of oppression coming from behind...</p>

    <p>Looking back, Peng Xiren's eyes met the dead fish eyes of Wang Ling, which was a light-year away.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren couldn't help but cursed on the spot: "Fuck! You can even catch me like this???"</p>

    <p>Although I was shocked at the pursuit of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, Peng Xiren felt a lot more relieved at this time.</p>

    <p>Judging from the opponent's relentless pursuit, there should be no problem with this Rubik's Cube...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, why would you be so nervous chasing him?</p>

    <p>"What a difficult guy..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren gritted his teeth and increased his speed again.</p>

    <p>Currently, he is approximately 1 light-year away from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling's hands were also gathering starlight. This was the inspiration he got from Peng Xiren's {Galaxy Fist}.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren wants to..." The monk was shocked. He probably guessed what Wang Ling wanted to do.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling is using starlight to condense a sword about one light-year long...</p>
