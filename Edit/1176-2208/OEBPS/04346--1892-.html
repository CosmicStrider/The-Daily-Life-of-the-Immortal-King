  <h1>Chapter 1892 Assassination of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu has been keeping his duty these days and obeying all orders. He just wanted to see Wang Ling and Sun Rong as soon as possible. As a result, these days passed day by day. Unexpectedly, he was let go again in the end.</p>

    <p>He was not an ignorant child. He immediately knew that Wang Ling and Sun Rong were probably in trouble.</p>

    <p>Thinking of his extremely realistic dream a few days ago, his colorful dragon heart immediately became suspended.</p>

    <p>The dragon's prophetic dream may not be as accurate as Wang Ling's. But the probability of hitting it is not low either. He dreamed of someone stabbing Wang Ling in the back.</p>

    <p>The white knife went in and the red knife came out. It stabbed Wang Ling's heart directly from behind. Then it stirred in his chest in a strange spiral.</p>

    <p>This nightmare made Wang Muyu wake up with sweat all over his head. He knew clearly that this was a prophecy, symbolizing that Wang Ling was about to be assassinated.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, he now received an answer from Mr. Crispy Noodles.</p>

    <p>He knew that there was nothing wrong with his father Wang Ling, he was just possibly entangled in a troublesome incident and it would take some time for him to get out of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu breathed a sigh of relief and looked out the window. He was the only one here in the huge Sun family castle and a bedroom as big as several living rooms. The feeling of longing and loneliness came to his heart in an instant.</p>

    <p>The high-tech toys and all kinds of imported snacks and drinks carefully prepared by Mr. Boss Sun in the bedroom have become boring things at this moment.</p>

    <p>The maids in the Sun family's castle all had standard professional smiles. Wang Muyu could tell. No matter what kind of question he asked, the other party had a standard set of words to answer. It was impossible to express anger.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu rang the bell. Soon a maid pushed open the door and entered. He stared out the window and asked, "When will Grandpa Sun come back?"</p>

    <p>The maid thought for a moment and replied patiently: "Master Muyu, don't be anxious. The master may be on his way back. Maybe he's not on his way back yet. Whether he comes back or not, he only has to wait a few hours or longer. You will know the moment the door is pushed open..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough. He knew as much whether he said it or not.</p>

    <p>Although he had already figured out the language system of this group of servants, Wang Muyu's heart was still broken. He just needed to know whether he was coming back, not coming back, or when he would come back. In the end, this group of people gave him a Schr√∂dinger's cat answer. Even the replies are full of philosophical thinking. He really can't get through this day.</p>

    <p>"I want to go out." Wang Muyu sighed. He couldn't wait any longer and was ready to leave.</p>

    <p>"Master Muyu, it's dangerous for you to go out now. It's already so late. Why don't you just wait here. If you go out..."</p>

    <p>Just when the maid wanted to continue arguing with him, Wang Muyu interrupted her bluntly: "Okay. Then I'll be obedient. I won't go out."</p>

    <p>"That's good." The maid nodded with satisfaction when she heard this, and then backed away from the bedroom.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu knew that if he applied for leave normally, he would definitely not be able to get out. So he had to trick the maid into getting there first.</p>

    <p>Now he knows the location of Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. And his current idea is to leave a clone in the Sun Family Castle so that the main body can go out and meet with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As a result, just as he was about to leave, a familiar and cold breath pierced through the air outside the Sun Family Castle. Almost immediately, Wang Muyu was extremely alert.</p>

    <p>The seven-color dragon horns on his head could not be retracted. Under the sudden force, they instantly grew out of the two corners of his forehead. They glowed like seven-color glass. In the night, they showed a beautiful fluorescent color, which was particularly conspicuous.</p>

    <p>"It's you..." Wang Muyu's eyes were alert, staring at a certain direction outside the window.</p>

    <p>A figure with dragon wings spread out on its back landed in the moonlight. It seemed to have been teleported here. The man wore familiar diamond gloves and held a black umbrella. There was a domineering look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu did not expect that Jingze would choose to appear again at this time. The affairs of the saints were not fully understood yet. These resurrected dragonborn came to cause trouble again.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Muyu feel a little annoyed. The main reason was that his travel was blocked. He wanted to see Wang Ling. But he was stopped at this time.</p>

    <p>Jingze crossed his arms. He rose above the void and showed a cold smile: "Every wrongdoer has his own debtor. The rest of the people in this castle have nothing to do with me. As long as you follow me."</p>

    <p>"Do you still want to be beaten?" Wang Muyu stared at Jingze: "You alone are not my opponent!"</p>

    <p>"You haven't fully grown up yet. As long as that person is not around, we still don't know who will win." Jingze said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Only then did Wang Muyu realize that this was actually a plan that had been designed from the beginning. Jingze and the others were trying to make a time difference. They planned to take advantage of Wang Ling, Sun Rong and the rest of the Office of Strategic Deception. When the core members are in the world where the mysterious text is located, they are waiting for an opportunity to take action.</p>

    <p>Their real goal had been running towards him from the beginning. It was just because they had been silent for a long time that it was a bit unexpected.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Bai Zhe's personality has changed. He is really not the same Bai Zhe as before. Such a precise layout design requires a lot of patience to be possible.</p>

    <p>In the past, Bai Zhe was very impatient. He always thought that he was invincible. There would definitely be no problem in dealing with Wang Ling. As a result, he would be beaten every time he made a move in a hurry.</p>

    <p>Today, Bai Zhe has continued to grow after repeated failures and has become an excellent strategist.</p>

    <p>This is indeed somewhat unexpected.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu's expression became serious. He stared at Jingze, who was above the void. He felt that the other person had become stronger than when he saw him before. It was a change that was almost completely transformed.</p>

    <p>The time apart is obviously not too long. According to the time conversion of the human cultivation world, it is not even a month before and after. How can they grow to this point?</p>

    <p>But Wang Muyu did not panic because of this. Jingze has indeed become stronger. But he seems to be playing during this period, but in fact he has also gone through all kinds of hard training!</p>

    <p>"It seems that you don't want to go with me. Then I will have to take you back by force."</p>

    <p>The next second, Jingze took action. He showed no mercy. His action was an endless flash of lightning. Thunder surged in the sky with a snap of his fingers. The thousands of thunder turned into a cage and headed towards Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"snort."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu snorted. He opened the window and jumped out with his small body.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the magnificent colorful dragonborn behind him opened up, forming an unbreakable barrier in front of him. At the moment when the electric prison approached, he waved the dragon wings and smashed the electric prison to pieces.</p>

    <p>He is a master who has gathered the genes of ten thousand dragons. He wants to use such an electric prison to trap him. Wang Muyu feels that Jingze is a little whimsical.</p>

    <p>However, his expression never relaxed. Because he looked at Jingze's calm and composed expression, he felt that the other party was prepared. He is afraid that something more unexpected is waiting for him next.</p>

    <p>What should I do? Should I find Auntie Nuan...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu thought in his heart.</p>
