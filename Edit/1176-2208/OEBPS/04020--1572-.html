  <h1>Chapter 1572 A demon child descends into the world...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was born ten days before the due date. Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>How strong this Ah Nuan girl is. Er Ha had already seen it before when she was still an embryo in her mother's womb.</p>

    <p>Able to hang Dao Ancestor Wang's mythical beast, the groundhog, and beat him!</p>

    <p>If this were officially born, it would be self-evident that his strength would be incredible.</p>

    <p>But that Fenmu Shen...is no ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Can it really be defeated?</p>

    <p>In the body of a baby?</p>

    <p>Are you sure you don't need to grow for a few more years?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was thinking in his heart.</p>

    <p>It stared out the window at the scene where the thunderbolts were dancing like silver snakes. It suddenly had a deeper understanding of the cause of this vision.</p>

    <p>Now. The thunder vision on this earth.</p>

    <p>Obviously, it was all caused by this Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>Dark clouds are coming, thunder is booming. Everything feels like the end of the world...</p>

    <p>Many cultivators on Earth raised their heads one after another, maintaining the same posture as Er Ha, looking up at the sky at a 45Â° angle.</p>

    <p>But the difference is.</p>

    <p>Except for Er Ha, the rest of the cultivators on earth do not know the reason behind this thunderous phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Many people think that there is great power in Tribulation Transcendence...</p>

    <p>In fact, there's a "devil child" about to be born.</p>

    <p>In the Wang family's small villa, all the spirits were in an orderly and orderly manner after countless exercises.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang ended up in a semi-conscious state. She was sent directly into the "sterile operating room" prepared in advance.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya also came very quickly.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma sent him here along with his two disciples Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>"The immortals are finally here! Please come!" Father Wang anxiously wandered in front of the refrigerator door. When he saw Immortal Toya appearing with Jin Shi and Yin Shi, he quickly stepped forward to greet him.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was flattered and bowed quickly: "Senior Wang, there is no need to be formal. These are what juniors should do. Ling Zhenren has already explained this to us before going abroad. The entire Office of Strategic Deception has been preparing for many days just to wait for Nuan Zhenren to be born. At this moment, make sure everything is safe!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In addition, the Head of State from the Huaxiu Alliance seems to be paying special attention to this matter. He also had a phone call with me a long time ago."</p>

    <p>"Then what did the Head of State say..."</p>

    <p>"Sir, please let Senior Wang rest assured. Leave the rest to us. Also, after Nuan Zhenren is born safely, hurry up and start writing. Don't learn from the shameless Ku Xuan." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>These were the original words from Head of State. He imitated them verbatim.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang didn't expect that having a girl in his family would be able to mobilize all the staff of the Office of Strategic Deception. This was something he didn't expect. He didn't know what to say. In shock, he could only hold his fists and salute: "That's it. Good job!"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter." Immortal Toya smiled gently.</p>

    <p>Then he opened the medicine gourd on his back. A spiritual mist spurted out from the mouth of the gourd, lingering on him, Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>This is the magic mist. It has a sterilizing and disinfecting effect when wrapped around the body.</p>

    <p>Can be used as a portable surgical gown.</p>

    <p>At this time, standing in front of the refrigerator door, Immortal Toya took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was serious but also revealed a bit of glory and pride.</p>

    <p>This was a highly anticipated delivery ceremony. He was highly expected to complete the task of delivering Nuan Zhenren.</p>

    <p>For this, Immortal Toya is extremely honored.</p>

    <p>"Jin Shi, Yin Shi. Are you ready?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"Everything is ready according to Master's instructions! My sister and I have rehearsed several times before." Jin Shi smiled, showing his dimples.</p>

    <p>"Rehearsal?"</p>

    <p>"It's Yin Shi simulating giving birth. Then I will..."</p>

    <p>"Ahem. Let's not talk about these things...the operation is urgent!"</p>

    <p>"It's Master."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt as if he knew something extraordinary.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the universe.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by another roar and explosion, the bright chaotic light seemed to pierce the barrier of the universe. A large area penetrated into the space of the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>The monk and Fenmu Shen fought again. His right arm was broken. His golden body was covered in blood. His handsome face was slightly swollen from the beatings.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was as happy as if she were teasing a little bird. She held the jade Buddha head in one hand and held it with the other hand.</p>

    <p>"It's boring, monk. You don't even deserve to be called my toy." Fenmu Shen showed a contemptuous smile: "If you want this thing, just take it..."</p>

    <p>Then, he let go of his hand, suddenly raised his leg and kicked the jade Buddha head towards the monk like a football.</p>

    <p>It seems like a very ordinary blow, but it contains vast divine power. It activates a terrible divine power like a star falling from the sky, lighting up the universe.</p>

    <p>With a bang, the monk's body flew up. His chest was hit by the head of the Jade Buddha. He coughed up a large amount of blood. The golden body all over his body was shattered inch by inch.</p>

    <p>The monk was so vulnerable. This was something Fenmu Shen did not expect.</p>

    <p>After a few rounds of fighting, he lost interest in the monk.</p>

    <p>He borrowed Peng Xiren's body to inherit the right to use the Tomb of Heaven. He received endless benefits and his strength increased greatly.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen thought that at this moment, it would not be an exaggeration for him to proclaim himself the Overlord of the Infinite Galaxy.</p>

    <p>He urgently needs to find a real strong person to prove his strength.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, Fenmu Shen expanded his perception infinitely. He penetrated from the infinite galaxy into the outer galaxy. He analyzed every inch of space in the universe. Every nebula...</p>

    <p>Finally. Fenmu Shen opened her eyes.</p>

    <p>Because at this moment, he suddenly felt a very strong spiritual energy fluctuation in the position of the earth.</p>

    <p>And the aura seeping out of this fluctuation is definitely not that of the young man named Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"There are other masters on this earth?" Fenmu Shen suddenly became excited.</p>

    <p>On the other side, the bloody monk has figured out what exactly happened on the earth.</p>

    <p>Honestly...</p>

    <p>This is something the monk did not calculate.</p>

    <p>He thought he had everything under control. But he didn't expect that Wang Nuan would be born early.</p>

    <p>What's even worse is that this breath was actually captured by Fenmu Shen!</p>

    <p>How big is this Nuan Zhenren...</p>

    <p>Even if she is Ling Zhenren's sister, how powerful can a newborn baby be?</p>

    <p>The monk gritted his teeth and endured the severe pain all over his body. He tried to step forward and delay again.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen had lost interest in the monk. He raised his hand and knocked the monk away like a fly: "Don't disturb me!"</p>

    <p>Then, he took steps and arrived around the earth in a few blinks. He used his purple eyes to track the source of the powerful spiritual energy fluctuations.</p>

    <p>But what disappointed Fenmu Shen was.</p>

    <p>What he tracked turned out to be a baby girl whose head had just emerged.</p>

    <p>Just a child?</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen frowned. He checked his judgment over and over again. He felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>And in the next second, he saw the newly born baby girl split into a shadow and appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Can you use shadow magic since you were born?" Fenmu Shen smiled.</p>

    <p>This shadow spell is not unusual in his opinion.</p>

    <p>But in a sense, he felt that the baby girl in front of him was self-taught as soon as she was born. In a sense, she was considered a talent.</p>

    <p>This is a potential stock.</p>

    <p>If she is captured and trained well, she can be his apprentice or wife in the future.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was thinking this at this time.</p>

    <p>He then extended his hand to Wang Nuan's shadow. He smiled kindly: "Little fellow. Will you come with me? If you don't. I'll blow up this planet. You'll have no home to go back to."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan said nothing. She just held out her little hand and shook it.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>She tore off Fenmu Shen's entire right arm like a pork belly...</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen thought. I think I've opened the door in the wrong way.</p>
