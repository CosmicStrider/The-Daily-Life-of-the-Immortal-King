  <h1>Chapter 2091 Return of All Realms 1</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Gathering power from multiple parallel spaces and condensing it onto the body...</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou was surprised. He felt that he understood Qiao Yanyuan's ability, but he didn't fully understand it.</p>

    <p>Because the ability of such a dragonborn is too amazing. The most important thing is that Qiao Yanyuan has reached the Ancestor King state without mobilizing the strength of other spatial bodies.</p>

    <p>If all the space bodies are mobilized and concentrated on oneself, how strong must it be?</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou couldn't find the words to use to describe the shock in his heart. But his mood couldn't help but surge.</p>

    <p>He knew that Qiao Yanyuan was very strong. But he didn't expect that his Dragonborn ability would be like this... This is the true unification of all realms! Becoming one!</p>

    <p>No matter how difficult that kid surnamed Wang is, can he still be strong like Qiao Yanyuan, who can unite all realms?</p>

    <p>At this time, Bai Yinshou was very excited. He had a clear power layout in his mind. He knew that the Zhang Zhui he hated most was an elder under the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And what about the Office of Strategic Deception? Who supported it?</p>

    <p>It's nothing more than the guy surnamed Wang who is sitting behind him.</p>

    <p>All in all, after seeing Qiao Yanyuan's dragon-born ability, Bai Yinshou suddenly felt a lot more at ease. And he felt that he was completely following the right person!</p>

    <p>You know, having the Ancestor King realm is already extraordinary. In addition, with such dragon-born abilities... Qiao Yanyuan. Maybe he can directly explode to the level of a true dragon!</p>

    <p>In the eons of time, a true dragon with such dragonborn abilities would definitely be an Ancestor Immortal-level existence!</p>

    <p>Although there are only three recognized leaders of the dragon clan, it does not mean that the combat power of the other true dragons is not as good as the three leaders.</p>

    <p>The root cause is because of Moonlight, Dark Devour, and Cangyuan. The three leaders of the dragon clan back then were true dragons at the ancestral level. They lived for a long time. In addition, their genetic abilities were very special. That's why they were able to sit in that position.</p>

    <p>With Qiao Yanyuan's dragon-born genetic ability, if he could complete the entire structure of his ability, there would undoubtedly be no solution.</p>

    <p>Now Qiao Yanyuan has become proficient in controlling tens of thousands of parallel dimensions. If he is given enough time, the number he can control will probably become even greater!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the Xiaobailong Maritime High-Speed Railway.</p>

    <p>At the front of the car, Yue Lingwei, who was in a posture, seemed to have received some news. After his pupils were out of focus for a moment, he suddenly woke up.</p>

    <p>He looked at Zhang Zhui, raised his eyebrows, and asked curiously: "Do you know Bai Yinshou?"</p>

    <p>"I've never heard of this person." Zhang Zhui shook his head.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei didn't talk nonsense. He directly raised his sword fingers and crossed them from the pupil. He projected Bai Yinshou's appearance directly into the void to form a three-dimensional image.</p>

    <p>Looking at the person in the projection, Zhang Zhui's memory seemed to be revived from eternity in an instant: "Oh, it's him. Feng Hua."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui knows this face very well.</p>

    <p>Feng Hua's hatred for him contained a desire to kill him and then be happy.</p>

    <p>In fact, when the alienated shark king was surging, Zhang Zhui felt that there were other eternal beings monitoring this place.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect this person to be Feng Hua.</p>

    <p>Obviously. At this time, Yue Lingwei asked him about this matter. He was obviously a representative. Feng Hua was also one of the enemies.</p>

    <p>And on that Moonlight cruise ship, he was probably one of the Eternal Ones who had been recruited by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>"The grudge between me and him cannot be explained in just a few words."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui didn't want to mention the past. He turned his gaze to the window. But he couldn't hold back his curiosity. He still asked: "How much do you know about him? How do you know?"</p>

    <p>"It's all the result of the Lord's calculation. As soon as he calculates, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord will know it. As soon as Crispy Noodles Dao Lord knows it, I will naturally be able to synchronize the news."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corner of Zhang Zhui's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>I bet this is the terminal server cloud information synchronization...</p>

    <p>"I heard that you slept with his wife?" Yue Lingwei squinted at Zhang Zhui with a look of disdain.</p>

    <p>"That's what happened."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was generous enough to admit it directly.</p>

    <p>After all, Zhang Zhui, who has become younger now, does have that naughty Neptune face, especially when he smiles. This feeling is particularly obvious.</p>

    <p>It is true that Zhang Zhui loved sowing seeds throughout the ages. But to be honest, Zhang Zhui himself was not willing to sow seeds.</p>

    <p>He was in trouble.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, I blame myself for being young and energetic.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is also because of his reputation as the eternal thief that he has a bad reputation. Therefore, no one believes his explanation at all.</p>

    <p>"If I say, in fact, I didn't steal those people's wives on purpose. They hired them themselves. Would you believe it?"</p>

    <p>"I won't believe what you said forever. But now, I don't believe it."</p>

    <p>"What does half-belief mean... everything I say is true."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui held his forehead. The expression on his face was very complicated. Ultimately, it was still the same as his previous analysis.</p>

    <p>His character throughout the ages was really pitiful. That's why no one believed him.</p>

    <p>But as an adult, he dares to take responsibility. Even if someone posted him, he did do something he shouldn't have done.</p>

    <p>"Princess of the Blood Clan. What's going on?" Yue Lingwei asked calmly.</p>

    <p>"You even know this..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui looked suspicious: "That's not right. I heard that Ling Zhenren had a very powerful algorithm called Aipuaide before. But wasn't it sent to other universes by Ling Zhenren? How could this happen? .."</p>

    <p>He was surprised by Wang Ling's information calculation ability. After all, this was a very ancient thing.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling is in a sealed state again. How can he still have such a strong deduction ability...can he deduce events so long ago?</p>

    <p>"It was indeed delivered."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei said: "So this is calculated by the master's flesh."</p>

    <p>"Human flesh deduction?"</p>

    <p>"He asked Li Xian. Li Xian fully explained."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhang Zhui's mouth twitched. It turns out there is a traitor!</p>

    <p>He has a pretty good relationship with Li Xian...</p>

    <p>Of course, Li Xian didn't know so much about him at first.</p>

    <p>Isn't it boring to stay in the Corpse Map? In addition, Zhang Zhui feels that he and Li Xian are sealed in the Supreme Corpse Map. Maybe they will be a skeleton in it for the rest of their lives. They will never be able to get out again.</p>

    <p>At that time, he and Li Xian completely became close friends. They almost exchanged bitter words with each other. They confided all the things they had done.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>This can only be blamed on Zhang Zhui himself for talking too much. www.uukanshu.net He can't blame others.</p>

    <p>He sighed. He looked at Yue Lingwei and said, "Actually, the vampire princess has nothing to do with him. It's just that he thinks too much."</p>

    <p>"It's okay for the former Feng Hua and the current Bai Yinshou to say that it was you who broke off his marriage."</p>

    <p>"If you don't like it, you don't like it. If you don't love it, you don't love it. There are not so many messy things."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "The vampire princess has to absorb a million creatures. Do you think Feng Hua can help the vampire princess find so many blood bags on his own?"</p>

    <p>"It's Feng Hua himself. He thinks that as long as he works hard and lets the vampire princess take a sip of his own blood after she achieves her special qualities, the other party will fall in love with him completely."</p>

    <p>At this point, Zhang Zhui sighed: "This matter has been told to you and me. From the beginning of eternity, even if you lick a dog, it will not end well..."</p>
