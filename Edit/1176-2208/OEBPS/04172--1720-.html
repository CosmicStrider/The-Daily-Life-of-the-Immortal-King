  <h1>Chapter 1720 Invasion Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Yi... ya." In front of the Wang family's small villa, Wang Nuan looked at the direction in which the two dragonborn were fleeing and sighed.</p>

    <p>She pinched 096's bunny ears. 096 let Wang Nuan knead it with a cute look. At the same time, Lord Ma, as the baby language translator, also quickly appeared next to Wang Nuan to translate accurately.</p>

    <p>He said that Wang Nuan sighed just now because she felt that the two dragonborn were too weak and there was no point in fighting.</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, everyone at the scene shivered... Even the Dragon Clan Dragonborn were too weak. How could others survive?</p>

    <p>"As expected of a senior sister!" Zhuo Yi bowed. He couldn't laugh or cry. In a sense, Wang Nuan's growth is even more amazing than the original Wang Ling. She is growing almost every day. And it is. Staged growth.</p>

    <p>When she was just born, she went to teach Fenmu Shen a lesson. In less than a few days, her combat power has made a qualitative leap again. She is more advanced than before.</p>

    <p>There is no need to think too much. If this matter is known to others, it will definitely shock the whole world and even the entire universe. Especially the group of Eternals who even know what the Eternal Dragon Clan is. Every one of them will be shocked.</p>

    <p>At the time when the Dragon Clan was at its peak, it was the most powerful being that could tear apart the Outer Gods with its bare hands. The Supreme Being of the Universe who was so powerful that no words can describe it.</p>

    <p>Sotos among the Outer Gods ranks second among the Outer Gods. But if the leader of the dragon tribe, the Dark Devouring Dragon, existed, just one Sotos would not be enough to defeat the Dark Devouring Dragon.</p>

    <p>Now two dragon descendants who have inherited the power of dragons and perfectly inherited the dragon bloodline. Powerful beings at the level of Earthly Ancestor... were punched by a baby who was less than half a month old and fled. What kind of situation is this?</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, the Dragon Clan is a race with strong self-esteem... They will definitely launch revenge. Senior Sister must be prepared." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Bah, bah, bah, bah." Wang Nuan replied.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma translated: "She said, it doesn't matter if you come more. And she has always wanted to know what dragon meat dumplings taste like."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Grand Auntie..." Zhou Ziyi almost knelt down when she heard this.</p>

    <p>In the past few days, his worldview has been completely overturned. In the past, he regarded Zhuo Yi as a hero. But now he has several more objects of worship.</p>

    <p>And he clearly knows that these objects can only be used for worship. They must be offered as offerings to gods. He can never surpass them.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After seeing that Wang Nuan's side successfully resolved the battle, Wang Ling in the Sword Spirit Space also breathed a sigh of relief. The little girl is very strong. With one person's strength, two dragonborns were able to flee. This made him feel a little bit. I marvel at my sister's growth.</p>

    <p>"Are you relieved?" Wang Ying raised the corners of his lips and couldn't help but laugh: "I told you before. Don't worry about that girl. That girl will definitely be able to stand up. She is very strong."</p>

    <p>Now, their top priority is to find the main reason why the people behind the scenes are planning these many plans.</p>

    <p>The resurgence of the dragon clan is a step in the grand plan of the people behind the Baobai Group, and targeting Sun Rong is also a crucial part of it.</p>

    <p>So what about Sun Rong? After they gain control of Sun Rong's body, what are they going to do?</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, it's just speculation at the moment. It's definitely not a good thing anyway.</p>

    <p>"The little girl named Chen Xiaomu seems to be here..." Sun Rong tried hard to maintain her composure and paid close attention to the changes outside. When the thought plagued people gathered in their villa were moving in one direction like zombies The moment the legions started to move. Sun Rong immediately knew that their action had begun.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid, Miss Rong. Stay calm. If they want to invade your body, don't resist. We are here anyway." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>Now it's a delaying strategy. They hide in the sword spirit space of Sun Rong and completely seal their aura. The main reason is to get more intelligence information.</p>

    <p>"Well... I won't be afraid."Sun Rong nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>She's not really afraid. Mainly she's a little nervous. She's afraid that she won't perform well and cause trouble to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>You must know that the current Wang Ling is in her sword spirit space... In a sense, he has also entered her body and followed her!</p>

    <p>Being penetrated... by the person I like...</p>

    <p>Ah!</p>

    <p>What a terrible line!</p>

    <p>What nonsense is she thinking about!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that it must be because she had been with Sun Ying'er for a long time. As a result, her thinking began to gradually change, making her unclean.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>After sitting quietly in the room and waiting for a while, the bedroom door was gently pushed open. A red ball rolled in at an inappropriate time. What followed was Chen Xiaomu who accidentally broke into the room pretending to chase the ball.</p>

    <p>I have to say, all the thinkers are great actors. With such acting skills, there is no problem in winning Best Actor and Best Actress.</p>

    <p>But the most embarrassing acting skill in the world is when you think you are acting realistically, but in fact everyone else knows you are just acting.</p>

    <p>"Sister. I'm sorry. I... didn't mean to come in." The thought plaguer spoke through Chen Xiaomu's body. He stared at the back of Sun Rong, a person sitting at a desk. He looked at Sun Rong A defenseless posture. I feel that I am actually completely mature.</p>

    <p>"Hehehe... Stupid woman. Give your body to me!"</p>

    <p>Then, it roared in its heart, stomped its foot, and flew out towards Sun Rong's back.</p>

    <p>It moved very fast through Chen Xiaomu's body. At the moment of flying, it separated a ball of light with three tentacles from Chen Xiaomu's body. It was suddenly attached to Sun Rong's body. On the back of the neck. The attack was extremely precise. It came with the purpose of invading Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that all this plan would go smoothly...</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, this woman has nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes. She shouldn't be that weak!</p>

    <p>It was doubtful in its heart. It felt that its body had begun to merge with Sun Rong. Just when it thought it was about to fully control Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the world in front of me began to become brighter.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" It was obviously stunned. At the same time, it looked at its own body. It was shocked to find that it did not look like Sun Rong. It was still in the same maggot-like shape with three tentacles on its lower body.</p>

    <p>"It's impossible... how could this happen..."</p>

    <p>It is obviously in disbelief.</p>

    <p>It has obviously been successfully attached to her body. According to past experience, it only takes less than 2 seconds for it to take complete control of her body!</p>

    <p>But now. It has landed in an inexplicable space...</p>

    <p>In a bright world, there are mountains nearby. And in the sky, there are actually six suns...</p>

    <p>It was shocked.</p>

    <p>He rubbed his eyes. Then he soon discovered that it was not the sun at all!</p>

    <p>That's six pairs of eyes!</p>

    <p>Two of them have dead fish eyes!</p>

    <p>It has indeed been adsorbed on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But just when it was about to invade, it was intercepted by Wang Ling three people who were ambushing it in the Sword Spirit Space!</p>

    <p>Then this thought plaguer was suppressed between the palms of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Accepting the gazes of Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Death Heavenly Dao.</p>
