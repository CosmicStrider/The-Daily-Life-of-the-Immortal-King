  <h1>Chapter 2075 The First Sword Master on Land</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: "Fortunately, Wuji is open. The sea of energy from all directions is coming!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, when the land's greatest swordsman shouted out his magic spell, the whole world seemed to be crumbling.</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi's color changed. He could feel that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth he had mobilized was absorbed by the Wuji Sword, and turned into the wedding dress of the Wuji Sword.</p>

    <p>That is the true return of all qi. It combines all the qi in the world into one.</p>

    <p>Everyone's expressions changed with shock, especially the Earth monks. They didn't even see the big bosses on Earth being promoted to Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Now, we see this legendary swordsman from Huaxiu country ascending to the Holy Realm. Directly on the high seas. Withstanding the huge pressure of the legendary casual cultivator Hong Siqi, he bucked the trend and was canonized in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>The onlookers all gasped. In other words, the Sword Master reached the ninth level of True Immortal earlier than rumored. And he has been accumulating strength for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>Now it's time to show off. Unlock the sea of Qi that has been stored in the body for thousands or even thousands of years. Following the Venerated Immortal spiritual pressure released by Hong Siqi's Venerated Immortal, he instantly finds a faster path and jumps up.</p>

    <p>This is not only a matter of accumulation, but also an amazing ability to understand.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu had already expected that the teacher he had just acquired might be hiding something and possessing extraordinary qualities. Although he was not surprised by this breakthrough, the character he saw displayed by Yi Jianchuan made him intoxicated the most. with fascination.</p>

    <p>Today's Sword Master has truly cultivated the holy path and reached the top of Sage Immortal!</p>

    <p>But a few minutes ago, he was still at the pinnacle of the ninth level of True Immortal. Facing Hong Siqi, who was a level beyond his own, his teacher still stood there. Like a giant standing tall, like Pangu opening the sky. Forever. With fearlessness and unyielding.</p>

    <p>He thought of what Yi Jianchuan said to him before. As long as there is no fear in the heart, everything can be turned into a sword in the hand.</p>

    <p>Everyone can tell lies. Wang Muyu originally thought it was just Yi Jianchuan's special teaching rhetoric. Now that he saw it, he realized that he was completely wrong.</p>

    <p>It turns out that his teacher...is really not afraid of anything!</p>

    <p>So what if you cross a large level of yourself?</p>

    <p>If you have a sword in your heart, there is nothing in this world that can't be cut!</p>

    <p>It can be said that the situation on the battlefield was completely reversed. He reached the top of Sage Immortal. Among the regular monks on earth! Yi Jianchuan was witnessed by everyone here. The canonization was established! He became the first person! He lived up to the name of legend. !</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi never dreamed that the order he took would turn out to be his own death. Originally, he was supposed to kill the legendary swordsman with Venerated Immortal and become famous!</p>

    <p>But now the situation has turned. In a short period of time, there is no possibility of him turning around.</p>

    <p>He just stood there. The sword light floated around him, and there was endless aura lingering. Both Wang Muyu and Zhang Zhui knew that this was no longer the aura of heaven and earth drawn from the earth.</p>

    <p>In the realm of Venerated Immortal, you can travel the universe and have the ability to initially adapt to the cosmic environment. You can also absorb trace amounts of cosmic spiritual energy from the universe to adjust your breath, forming an internal cycle.</p>

    <p>However, the trace amount of cosmic spiritual energy taken in alone is obviously not enough. Therefore, Venerated Immortal usually needs to bring its own supplies when traveling the universe. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost halfway.</p>

    <p>In the eons of time, there were many monks who were frozen on the spot and became an eternal humanoid meteorite in the cosmic environment due to the lack of spiritual energy in the body that directly prevented the body from functioning normally.</p>

    <p>And reaching the top of the holy realm means that you will no longer be shackled by such cosmic spiritual energy. You can even directly sense the cosmic spiritual energy and draw energy from it.</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi was completely panicked. This was no longer the same level of strength. There was no need to fight at all.</p>

    <p>But at this time, it is obvious that it cannot end easily.</p>

    <p>After all, he was the one who made the first move. He was the first to make the mistake.</p>

    <p>So. He tried to argue.</p>

    <p>In the void, ethereal voices could be heard: "Sword Master, it's just a misunderstanding. Why do you need to be so serious?"</p>

    <p>"Since ancient times, anyone who offends me, Huaxiu, will be punished no matter how far away!"</p>

    <p>The sword master was calm and calm. He put his hands behind his back and responded calmly: "Hong Siqi, no matter who you are interested in. I just want to say a word to you at this moment."</p>

    <p>His voice is not loud, but it is like a great bell. It can reach almost every corner of the earth.</p>

    <p>"Cut it open with one sword. Prevent ten thousand swords from coming!"</p>

    <p>As soon as this statement came out, everyone knew it. There was no room for discussion on this matter.</p>

    <p>And obviously, it can be heard from these words that Yi Jianchuan is not completely ignorant of Hong Siqi's origins.</p>

    <p>On the contrary. At this moment, he might have guessed who the main messenger behind Hong Siqi's plot was.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, you should be aware of this move." At this moment, Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan immediately responded through a voice message. His tone was soft and kind: "Muyu, you must know that not everyone in this world expects good things from us."</p>

    <p>"They don't want others to live a good life. That's why they often provoke disputes. The teacher's sword did not kill Hong Siqi, but the ambition of the person behind him."</p>

    <p>"The teacher's sword is to tell him that as long as the teacher is around, no one can even think about Huaxiu..."</p>

    <p>Say it.</p>

    <p>Brush!</p>

    <p>The surrounding seawater surged instantly. The sea level within a hundred miles radius actually rose at the same time!</p>

    <p>Everyone's color changed and they all gasped. The casual cultivators who were watching couldn't sit still and quickly evacuated from Yama Island.</p>

    <p>This sword is a sword formed by the convergence of sea water with a radius of hundreds of miles. Along with the rising sea surface in all directions, countless waterspouts condense in several directions, condensing to a point in the void!</p>

    <p>Then quickly freeze it with cosmic spiritual energy! Forge it into the Holy Sword of the Sea!</p>

    <p>This is a sword that mobilizes the will of the sea. And it is done with ease. There is no sign of panic.</p>

    <p>This proves that the sword master mobilized spiritual energy on such a large scale to cast a sword. The sword master did not exert the full power of the Sage Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>Everyone was terrified. If this sword were to strike, a new trench would probably be created on the earth!</p>

    <p>Many people's cheeks were sweating, including Hong Siqi. But the difference was that the people in the area could escape. Only Hong Siqi was directly oppressed by the sword.</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi of Venerated Immortal. His whole figure was frozen in place as if his acupuncture points had been tapped. His whole body was being penetrated by the Sword Master's sword energy all the time, sealing his spirit and breaking his veins. There was no possibility of him turning over.</p>

    <p>"Loan to repair immortal...Good guy, if this sword goes down, what should I do with the money I owe?" Among the onlookers, Zhang Zhui suddenly thought of a very magical question.</p>

    <p>He was floating in the air, watching the battle from a distance. On his right stood the Yue Lingwei, and what he held in his left and right hands were the pair of "dying men" Ouyang brothers.</p>

    <p>The two brothers were just watching a battle in the Venerated Immortal realm, looking for a way to break through. As a result, they directly saw a battle in the Sage Immortal realm. They were so excited that they fainted on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Hong Siqi. Maybe he won't die. Someone will protect him." Yue Lingwei reasoned.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, just as he finished speaking.</p>

    <p>Distant space. A voice came...</p>
