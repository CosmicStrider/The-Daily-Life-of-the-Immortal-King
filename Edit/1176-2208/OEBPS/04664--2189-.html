  <h1>Chapter 2189 The crisis of Sun Rong is coming again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! For a moment, the atmosphere was a bit more awkward than Sun Rong imagined. She thought that chatting with Wang Ling about her sister would open up the conversation. But she I found that I still overestimated the feedback ability of this wood.</p>

    <p>However, it's not entirely without gain...</p>

    <p>Jingke just said... stay up late?</p>

    <p>Wang LingDid you stay up late last night?</p>

    <p>Is the immortal king's staying up late called staying up late? It's just because he doesn't want to sleep.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong knows Wang Ling too well. A teenager who always just wants to live a peaceful life like ordinary people will of course pursue the right to sleep normally like ordinary people. So even though Wang Ling can indeed Not sleeping. Even not sleeping all the time... And this not sleeping will not have any impact on myself. But Wang Ling will try hard to sleep for eight hours every night like ordinary people.</p>

    <p>Something that makes Wang Ling stay up late. It must be something very important.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought about it. A drop of cold sweat began to flow from his forehead. And he suddenly felt a rare sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>She suddenly wanted to know why Wang Ling stayed up late for... what could be so important.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er?Ying'er?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong called Sun Ying'er several times in his heart.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er did not respond at all...</p>

    <p>The sunlight filtered through the spirit iron window. Sun Rong then realized that neither he nor Wang Ling had a shadow.</p>

    <p>Obviously. Sun Ying'er and Master of Shadows went to have in-depth communication in private again...</p>

    <p>Pity.</p>

    <p>If Sun Ying'er was around, she might be able to get some information.</p>

    <p>But now. It's obviously impossible.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had a premonition that Wang Ling stayed up late last night. It was very unusual.</p>

    <p>She admitted that there was a little bit of jealousy in this, which made her so concerned about what the boy did when he stayed up late last night...</p>

    <p>As a result, the thing that worried Sun Rong the most happened.</p>

    <p>In the carriage in the distance, a very familiar and beautiful figure walked towards them. She was still holding the pink floating dust and walking on her straw sandals. With a smile on her face: "I didn't expect to meet you two here."</p>

    <p>It was none other than the female Taoist priest from Fenglei Taoist Temple. Wang Ling's little girl, You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Sun Rong's mood took a turn for the worse. It started to get a little worse.</p>

    <p>I actually ran into You Yueqing while taking the subway...</p>

    <p>Is this a coincidence?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was silent.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong has always been more or less hostile towards this childhood sweetheart whom Wang Ling has known since childhood.</p>

    <p>In addition, this female Taoist priest is equal to her in almost every aspect from appearance to temperament. He is not inferior to her in the slightest. It is like Sun Rong feels a strong sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>Although he was unhappy in his heart, Sun Rong would still try his best to restrain himself in front of outsiders and show a kind of dignity and generosity: "Hello, Mr. You!"</p>

    <p>"Principal Wang. Miss Rong. I didn't expect that we are still as destined as before."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing laughed: "Speaking of which, where are you two going?"</p>

    <p>Before she could finish speaking, You Yueqing began to play with the turtle shell in her hand and threw two copper coins. Then she showed a look of realization: "I understand! It turns out you two are going to the same place as me. !"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun RongThere is reason to believe that You Yueqing is definitely lying. But unfortunately there is no evidence.</p>

    <p>In addition, the turtle shell in You Yueqing's hand was a gift from Wang Ling back then. She does have a certain degree of ability to deduce fortune-telling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong could only hold back all the words in his heart. He continued to say politely: "We are going to a community to visit friends."</p>

    <p>She was very careful and did not directly name the community.</p>

    <p>As a result, You Yueqing laughed to herself: "South Immortal District. A dream?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked. Because Yi Meng Xiao Yao was the community they were going to. You Yueqing had really calculated it accurately. And she accurately named the community.</p>

    <p>"Daoist You is also going here?" Sun Rong asked in disbelief.</p>

    <p>"yes.</p>

    <p>My home is here." You Yueqing said. "Your home? Doesn't Master You live in a Taoist temple?"</p>

    <p>"Although I usually live in Taoist Temple, I occasionally want to experience city life. So I have houses in various districts of Songhai City. Yimengxiaoyao is the latest high-end community built. When I bought it, it only cost 60,000. Yiping. Now it has risen to 180,000."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Hearing this, she almost had the urge to buy the entire plot of land in the community... She really didn't want to see You Yueqing. She felt like she was seeing through everything in her life. It seems that I am so weak and passive.</p>

    <p>The confrontation between the two women was brief. But even Wang Ling could sense the huge amount of information brought by the game behind it.</p>

    <p>He actually doesn't have much experience with this kind of reconciliation. He just feels uncomfortable being caught in it.</p>

    <p>Whether it's Sun Rong or You Yueqing. One is his high school classmate. The other is his childhood sweetheart... Of course. Wang Ling doesn't know that he and You Yueqing are either. Can they be considered childhood sweethearts? But Mother Wang thinks they are. So let's just consider it okay.</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling and I went to visit a good friend. He lives here." Sun Rong said helplessly. It could be seen that the expression on her face was uncomfortable. She wished she could leave early at the next stop.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was caught in the middle. His mind almost reacted subconsciously.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know why he reacted like this...</p>

    <p>But when the train pulled into the next station, he actually pulled Sun Rong and left early.</p>

    <p>Although they didn't hold hands. They just used the attraction technique to secretly pull Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing did not follow. She just looked at their backs with a smile. Then as the train door closed tightly, she turned into an afterimage and disappeared in front of them...</p>

    <p>It wasn't until this moment that Wang Ling realized that he seemed to have done something extraordinary that he had never done before.</p>

    <p>He actually made a choice between two girls. And the one he chose was... Sun Rong?</p>
