  <h1>Chapter 1857 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The palace maid was carrying a tray and walked with a staggering posture. Although she didn't show much expression on her face, Sun Rong and Zhang Zhui were still keenly aware of something strange.</p>

    <p>The two looked at each other and confirmed their eyes again. They thought that this palace maid might be one of them.</p>

    <p>However, not everyone has particularly obvious habit characteristics. And not everyone is like Zhang Zhui. The iron wire is the body.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is difficult to know who is living in this palace maid's body just by judging with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"Are you...Gu Shunzhi's little friend?" At this time, Zhang Zhui asked without hesitation. He just intuitively believed that the body of this palace maid should be a man.</p>

    <p>Because it was obvious that his walking posture was wrong. He seemed to be troubled by the sudden weight on his chest... And among them, there were only a few men.</p>

    <p>If it is Li Xian, Zhang Zhui can feel it immediately. Monk Jin Deng has the experience of being a woman in countless reincarnations. Therefore, even if he enters a woman's body, there will be no sense of disobedience.</p>

    <p>The only ones left are Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi, Gu Shunzhi and Wang Zhen...</p>

    <p>Of course, Zhang Zhui was not very familiar with these four people, so he could only guess based on intuition.</p>

    <p>As soon as these words were spoken, the palace maid immediately raised her face with an expression as if she was about to cry: "I am Wang Zhen! Not Gu Shunzhi!"</p>

    <p>"puff!--"</p>

    <p>At that moment, neither Zhang Zhui nor Sun Rong could hold back their laughter.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's visible grievance combined with his tearful voice made the two people present unable to help laughing.</p>

    <p>To be honest, since confirming the relationship with Liu Qingyi, perhaps because of Liu Qingyi's strong performance in love, Wang Zhen occasionally dreams about himself suddenly becoming a woman...</p>

    <p>For a straight man, this is simply a huge torture.</p>

    <p>But Wang Zhen never thought that he would actually encounter such a thing one day.</p>

    <p>Not only did he travel through time, he entered a diary world constructed with mysterious texts.</p>

    <p>He even became a maid in the imperial palace...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's heart was broken.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the palace maid's body seems to be not very good. Wang Zhen has been feeling like vomiting since entering her body.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be brother Wang Zhen. I'm Zhang Zhui. The one sitting inside is Miss Sun. Hey, I didn't expect that the world of eternal cultivation is so big. The three of us can meet here. It's really a kind of fate." Zhang Zhui couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>"We have to find a way back quickly. This body is too weak. I feel like vomiting every now and then. I can't stay in there at all." Wang Zhen said worriedly.</p>

    <p>"Weak? No way."</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui heard this, he immediately frowned.</p>

    <p>"This is a palace maid in the Great Emperor's palace. She is said to be a palace maid, but in fact she is hired by the royal family."</p>

    <p>"The identity behind each palace maid is not simple. The one you are wearing now is the saint of the Holy Stone Sect."</p>

    <p>"She was sent to the palace for training. Her own strength is not weak. She has the realm of Dao God."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was immediately dumbfounded when he heard these words: "What? Dao God..."</p>

    <p>He was amazed.</p>

    <p>In their divine domain, Dao God could be the head of a family... but in the eternal period, Dao God was actually just a palace maid.</p>

    <p>But after listening to what Zhang Zhui said, Wang Zhen immediately felt how complicated the forces in this ancient era were. It was okay that various sects actually rushed their own people to send them to the palace. And it was still in the name of training. How could he listen to him? Did you say that the feudal dynasties in history were completely different?</p>

    <p>"So...she is really a saint?"</p>

    <p>The look of astonishment on Wang Zhen's face continued: "No wonder I saw some scenes of people worshiping her in my memory. But the memory of this saint seems to be incomplete. The memory after entering the palace is fragmented."</p>

    <p>"It should be that something bad happened. It's not necessarily selective amnesia."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui frowned and said.</p>

    <p>According to the memory provided by Ye Ren, he only knew that the backgrounds of these men and women sent into the imperial palace were extraordinary. And he only remembered a few special ones. Not all of them had the right names.</p>

    <p>For example, this saint of the Holy Stone Sect has always had a cold face, so she left a particularly deep impression on Ye Ren. And because she doesn't talk much and acts in a low-key manner, Ye Ren's understanding of her is only limited to her. It's just her background.</p>

    <p>But at this time, he heard Wang Zhen mention that the saint was weak.</p>

    <p>This made the expression on Zhang Zhui's face become suspicious.</p>

    <p>He stepped forward and grabbed Wang Zhen's wrist. He held it for a moment. Then the smile on his face gradually grew arrogant: "I see. That's it..."</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Stop being the Riddler. I'm almost annoyed to death, Senior Zhang." Wang Zhen asked a little irritably.</p>

    <p>"If I'm right, it should be you...oh no, it's your body that's pregnant."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "???"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also dumbfounded: "Then what should we do now? If we never go back, wouldn't it be..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "That's right. If you never go back, I'm afraid little friend Wang Zhen will have to experience the pain of giving birth in October."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>Regarding Wang Zhen's experience, Zhang Zhui also expressed sympathy: "We were all sent here by the power of the mysterious text. We haven't found a way out yet."</p>

    <p>"And except for the three of us, we don't know what role the rest of us play in this world."</p>

    <p>"The only way to be saved is to find Ling Zhenren. I believe he must be playing someone here."</p>

    <p>"Of course. Ling Zhenren doesn't like words. Finding him will be as difficult as climbing to the sky."</p>

    <p>"If you really can't go back...then just make peace with what you have become..."</p>

    <p>As he said that, he couldn't help but pat Wang Zhen on the shoulder, with an expression of trying hard to suppress a smile.</p>

    <p>When something like this happens to anyone, it is undoubtedly a heavy blow.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that such a thing would happen.</p>

    <p>"Hurry up and straighten your expression. Little friend Wang Zhen, now is not the time for you to cry. We have to act according to the following plot. Otherwise, it will affect the trajectory of history."</p>

    <p>He tried to comfort Wang Zhen: "You step aside and collect your emotions first. At least don't let Emperor Dongda see it. The emperor of the Eastern Region will be here soon."</p>

    <p>"Okay... but Senior Zhang, you must think of something!" Wang Zhen nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's natural. As long as I'm here, you and Miss Sun won't be trapped here forever." At this time, Zhang Zhui once again spoke to comfort you.</p>

    <p>Neither Sun Rong nor Wang Zhen expected that at the critical moment, Zhang Zhui would turn out to be extremely reliable and have an unexpected side.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, the Yangxin Hall immediately became quiet.</p>

    <p>The three of them waited in the Yangxin Hall for a while. An accompanying veteran shouted from outside the hall: "The emperor has arrived!"</p>

    <p>An extraordinary and heroic man dressed in the robe of the Suzaku Emperor, with a crown of imperial jade feathers on his head, slowly walked in from outside the Yangxin Hall surrounded by a group of attendants...</p>
