  <h1>Chapter 1385 Verification of identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Use the three scrolls to rejuvenate and extinguish the flame of the eternal lamp. This will unlock the passage to the next secret room.</p>

    <p>The girl's intelligence was once again demonstrated in cracking the mechanism.</p>

    <p>The level of realm sometimes has nothing to do with IQ.</p>

    <p>Fools with high cultivation levels also exist in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>They are only particularly gifted in cultivation.</p>

    <p>When the three eternal lights are pressed at the same time.</p>

    <p>The mechanism leading to the next secret room is triggered.</p>

    <p>The three scrolls in front of me emitted a faint light in the dim cave and turned into three entrances.</p>

    <p>"It looks like we have to separate to carry out missions. Follow the normal script. We will find a meeting place later."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "Let me go to the entrance in the middle. Everyone should be careful. And pay extra attention. Everything you see after that may not be true."</p>

    <p>"Is there an element of illusion?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Absolutely." Er Ha said: "So the best question is to ask questions. If you can know some more private questions, maybe you are the real person."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Ajuan both nodded.</p>

    <p>Before departure. Ajuan temporarily took the Divine Rabbit into his core world.</p>

    <p>They had a clear division of labor. Then they each entered the picture scroll in front of them.</p>

    <p>This is truly a solo mission.</p>

    <p>Without Er Ha and Ajuan to guide me, Sun Rong doesn't know if I can do it.</p>

    <p>But Ying'er and Aohai are here. This makes Sun Rong feel a little relieved.</p>

    <p>The third secret room is completely different from the previous abyss and cave. This is a very bright place.</p>

    <p>"Mirror Maze?"Sun Rong found himself trapped at the entrance of a mirror maze.</p>

    <p>There was no way to go back through the secret room she had passed. She turned back. Sure enough, the entrance where the scroll opened had disappeared.</p>

    <p>"I wonder what kind of secret room Er Ha and Ajuan encountered..." Sun Rong frowned. Then he mustered up the courage to move forward.</p>

    <p>She tried to use Aohai's sword energy to cover the entire mirror maze. Find the most suitable route.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of the resonance of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. Aohai's sword energy is particularly scattered here.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the plan to use sword energy to crack the maze failed.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong made a mark on the ground with Aohai. After walking around for a few times, he found that he was back to the starting point.</p>

    <p>It's more than that.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong tried to use Aohai to break the mirror.</p>

    <p>When the mirror breaks, a light will emit, taking her back to the entrance.</p>

    <p>"It's useless to walk aimlessly like this. Rongrong!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I know."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded: "But what does the mirror maze here mean?"</p>

    <p>The abyss and caves they broke through before are all related to the story of Dao Ancestor Wang and the Old God.</p>

    <p>And the mirror maze in front of me makes Sun Rong completely confused.</p>

    <p>Maybe if Miss Ajuan is here, she might be able to think of something.</p>

    <p>But now Ajuan is not around either. Sun Rong cannot listen to the story of Old God through Ajuan.</p>

    <p>"All girls have a mirror of their own, right? Maybe so many mirrors are related to Old God?" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>These words gave Sun Rong another hint.</p>

    <p>She took the initiative to walk towards a mirror. Then she began to stare at herself in the mirror.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er exclaimed: "Rongrong is so beautiful! And I think Rongrong's skin type doesn't require makeup. She can be liked by Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with Mr. Guan Wang Ling? You're talking nonsense again..." Sun Rong was helpless.</p>

    <p>But by looking at the mirror, she did find a very strange thing: "And. Ying'er. I didn't actually wear makeup today! But look at the mirror. Does it have its own beauty effect?"</p>

    <p>"With its own beauty effect?" Sun Ying'er was stunned.</p>

    <p>She looked carefully in the mirror and found that this seemed to be the case.</p>

    <p>Microdermabrasion and whitening are nothing. In the mirror, even the shape of my face begins to look sharper!</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong took another step forward.</p>

    <p>She changed the mirror. Then she found that the beauty effect of this mirror was even worse than before...</p>

    <p>"I probably know... how to get through this level!" Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>All the mirrors in this mirror maze have different beauty effects. They are mainly reflected in skin whitening and chin.</p>

    <p>The pointier the chin is, it means the deeper position they are in. It also means the only correct way.</p>

    <p>After repeated comparisons, Sun Rong finally followed the clue and found the last mirror.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, your chin is almost turning into an awl. You can use it to cut ice!" Sun Ying'er stared at the distorted Sun Rong in the mirror. She couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"This should be the exit of the maze." Sun Rong took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>If her judgment is correct, she can just break the mirror and she can go out!</p>

    <p>"Ha!" Sun Rong held back his strength. He pulled out Aohai and cut the extremely excessive beauty mirror in front of him in two.</p>

    <p>This time, when the mirror broke, no light came out to send her back to the entrance.</p>

    <p>Right in front of Sun Rong, there is a worn-out stone staircase leading to an ancient temple. There are deep vegetation on both sides. Dense ancient trees stand tall. Thick trunks are intertwined on the ground.</p>

    <p>There is actually a cave behind this mirror. It is an unknown ancient dense forest.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little hesitant at first.</p>

    <p>But thinking that Er Ha and Ajuan might have already walked out of the secret room, Sun Rong mustered up the courage to continue walking forward.</p>

    <p>If nothing else happens, they may reunite in this ancient dense forest.</p>

    <p>The dilapidated stone steps at your feet lead to the top of the mountain. The stone steps are engraved with intricate ancient runes. They have a natural oppressive force.</p>

    <p>Although the girl was only in the Foundation Building stage, she was protected by Aohai's sword energy when she walked. It was completely effortless.</p>

    <p>Walking to the mountainside. Sun Rong saw a familiar figure coming out of a path ahead.</p>

    <p>"Er Ha!"Sun Rong waved hello from afar.</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha's eyes seemed particularly wary. It quickly took a few steps back and looked at the girl with hostility.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately remembered what Er Ha said before.</p>

    <p>After they separate, they may see illusions. In order to avoid being misled, they need to ask each other questions to verify their identity.</p>

    <p>"Let's ask each other questions!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded and accepted the proposal.</p>

    <p>"What is your favorite thing to eat?"Sun Rong was the first to ask.</p>

    <p>"Flies! Big meat flies!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha's answer was very decisive. Without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Then, it said: "Then, it's my turn to ask!"</p>

    <p>Before asking the question, Er Ha did not forget to glare at Sun Ying'er: "The girl next to you is not allowed to interrupt! After she answers, I will test you again!"</p>

    <p>"Slightly!" Sun Ying'er stuck out his tongue.</p>

    <p>Er Ha took a deep breath. He looked at Sun Rong with a wicked smile and asked: "Tell me! Who do you like best!"</p>

    <p>"I..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face suddenly turned red.</p>

    <p>"Don't use relatives as excuses for me!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha's expression was very serious: "It must be a human being! And it must be a man! Say it quickly!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>While asking questions, it was also smiling evilly in its heart.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>How could I not know that you are really Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Just by smelling it, you can actually tell the difference!</p>

    <p>But with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tease me, wouldn't it be a pity not to tease her properly?</p>
