  <h1>Chapter 1268 The Miraculous Zen Master Jin Deng</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment, the surprise in Lord Diulei's heart cannot be described in words.</p>

    <p>He is in the realm of True Venerated Immortal. Although he got to this realm by eating Heavenly Dao broccoli inspired by your brother, his current strength has indeed reached an otherworldly level.</p>

    <p>As far as cultivators on earth are concerned, his current combat power is only inferior to that of Zhenyuan Immortal...</p>

    <p>But what surprised him was...</p>

    <p>My own True Venerated Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>In addition, he has the hand speed and explosive power accumulated from being single for more than 2,000 years.</p>

    <p>Even with his dominant hand, he couldn't even move the gate of Kaiguang Temple even half an inch.</p>

    <p>"This Zen Master Jin Deng is indeed an extraordinary person..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought secretly.</p>

    <p>On the way to Kaiguang Temple, he had always had doubts about the identity of Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>After all, there are so many charlatans these days.</p>

    <p>And the hypocrites who defraud money and sex in the name of religion are even more rampant.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>A Dharma title that I have never heard before.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought he was not a big deal.</p>

    <p>But. He now realizes that he was wrong.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei understood instantly. The gate of Kaiguang Temple was probably a test for himself by Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>If I can't push through the temple gate, I'm afraid this career will be in vain.</p>

    <p>There was no other way. Lord Diulei had to look serious.</p>

    <p>He took a breath.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Lord Diulei's palm was shining brightly.</p>

    <p>The azure pure spiritual light was like a layer of coating, firmly wrapped in his palm.</p>

    <p>This slap was not slapped casually by Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Since he was seeking an audience with a Buddhist Zen master, Lord Diulei naturally had to show his own attitude.</p>

    <p>The experience he accumulated from traveling around the world was of great help at this moment.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that even though Lord Diulei is not a disciple of Buddhism, he can rely on the experience he has accumulated from everywhere to display the unique skills of various sects.</p>

    <p>And now. What Lord Diulei has sacrificed.</p>

    <p>It was the {Great Compassion Palm} that he learned from an eminent Shaolin monk.</p>

    <p>This is a water-based palm technique. It emphasizes the soft power of moistening things silently, like the spring breeze turning into rain.</p>

    <p>It looks like a soft palm. It is very confusing.</p>

    <p>But when it really falls, it will produce explosive power!</p>

    <p>This palm of Lord Diulei has been practiced to great perfection.</p>

    <p>The power of nourishment that is friendly to all things emanates from his palm, causing the flowers and plants in the nearby mud cracks to grow rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Even the tree in the temple was affected by the fluctuation of this palm. The tall branches suddenly grew horizontally and stretched out outside the temple.</p>

    <p>And just when Lord Diulei was about to take action.</p>

    <p>Inside the temple, Zen Master Jin Deng's voice came again: "Zhenjun, please come in. You can hold this door of my temple down. I'm afraid you won't be able to take it."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei bowed at the door. He quickly withdrew his palm.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he saw that the gate of Kaiguang Temple had slowly opened.</p>

    <p>This temple is very small. Lord Diulei saw no one else. There is a copper incense burner in the atrium. Directly opposite is the Main Hall.</p>

    <p>A monk with a ring scar on his head, wearing an old cassock, was beating wooden fish inside.</p>

    <p>"See the Master."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei did not see the true face of Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Just look at his back from a distance at the threshold. He bends down to bow and salutes respectfully.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome, Zhenjun. Let's go into the palace and talk." Zen Master Jin Deng smiled.</p>

    <p>Then, Lord Diulei just stepped into the threshold.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, a huge pressure came over me, making it difficult to breathe.</p>

    <p>This floor tile...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei realized that the floor tiles he was stepping on had also been blessed by this Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>However, although such pressure was fierce, it did not stop Lord Diulei's pace.</p>

    <p>The distance from the door to the main hall is only 20 meters. It is extremely short yet extremely far away.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei did not expect that his journey would be so difficult.</p>

    <p>If True Immortal comes here, I'm afraid he won't be able to take a single step...</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, Lord Diulei arrived in the main hall.</p>

    <p>The pressure dissipated, making him feel as if dozens of mountains had been lifted off his body. He felt relaxed instantly.</p>

    <p>"Have I passed the master's test?" Lord Diulei asked with a wry smile.</p>

    <p>The monk in front of him was actually younger than he thought. His hair and beard were not all gray as described in the legend.</p>

    <p>This makes Lord Diulei feel strange.</p>

    <p>Dr. Liu Min clearly said that Zen Master Jin Deng is very old.</p>

    <p>"It can't be said to be a test. Because I have known for a long time that the true king will be able to pass through my courtyard."</p>

    <p>The monk knocked on the wooden fish and said slowly: "The Main Hall is not open to outsiders on weekdays. Those pilgrims only burn incense at the incense burner."</p>

    <p>"Pilgrims won't feel any pressure when they step into this place?"</p>

    <p>"Their lack of realm cannot be noticed. On the contrary, the higher the realm, the harder it is to take steps in the atrium outside the temple."</p>

    <p>Zen Master Jin Deng smiled and said: "There are 3910 floor tiles in this temple. Each tile represents the reincarnation of a poor monk."</p>

    <p>These words made Lord Diulei's pupils tremble.</p>

    <p>A brick. Is it reincarnation?</p>

    <p>Calculated in this way, how long has this Zen Master Jin Deng lived?</p>

    <p>This reminded Lord Diulei of a person.</p>

    <p>To have such an identity...</p>

    <p>Could it be the founder of Heavenly Dao, Dao Ancestor Wang, the ancestor of the Wang family that Wang Zhen said?</p>

    <p>But these are just speculations in Lord Diulei's mind.</p>

    <p>He had previously suspected that Dao Ancestor Wang was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling denied this.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei suppressed the shock in his heart. He couldn't help but ask: "Since Master has known for a long time that I am coming, do you know why I am here..."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know. You were asked to spy on me for the life of a girl."</p>

    <p>"Master, please don't blame..."</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun, there is no need to panic." Zen Master Jin Deng smiled and said, "In my thousand reincarnations, I have been spied on many times. I have long been used to it. Zhenjun is already the most polite one. When I opened the door, I was still polite. You know how to use my Buddhist palm skills to say hello."</p>

    <p>"Master's praise..."</p>

    <p>"The poor monk has been in this consecrated temple for many years. He has given many blessings to himself and many others. He never insists on conditions. Saving one life is better than building a seven-level pagoda. Monks and monks help, as long as it is within their ability. It's all as it should be."</p>

    <p>When Zen Master Jin Deng said this, the hand that was beating the wooden fish in his hand paused: "But this time, the poor monk has to make a condition..."</p>

    <p>"Master, just say it doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>"I want something from Zhenjun."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"Eye."</p>

    <p>"My eyes?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was startled.</p>

    <p>"No. It's the one someone gave you."</p>
