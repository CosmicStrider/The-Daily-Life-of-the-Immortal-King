  <h1>Chapter 1655 Kind-hearted Zhu Yuanrun</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Stop Hei Long.</p>

    <p>This mission sounds reasonable. But based on Ducas' understanding of Zhu Yuanrun, he felt that this old guy would not be so kind for no reason.</p>

    <p>After accepting the pass, Zhu Yuanrun did not force him to stay. He did not even sign any specific contract with Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi, and Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>A purely verbal agreement makes people feel more mysterious and uneasy.</p>

    <p>Because he got the long-awaited core area pass, Ducas quickly completed the handover of director.</p>

    <p>The next director is his chosen candidate.</p>

    <p>And he packed all kinds of belongings that he had prepared in advance into packages and placed them on a luxuriously decorated carriage.</p>

    <p>He couldn't wait to get to the core area. That paradise-like world that could be clearly separated from the slums.</p>

    <p>From the moment he got the pass, Ducas couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was standing in front of the carriage, having a final conversation with Sun Rong and others.</p>

    <p>"I still maintain my original point of view. This Zhu Yuanrun is not a simple character. He wants you to deal with the commander. There must be other reasons behind it... Don't believe that he is just to repay your nonsense." Ducas frowned and said: "This person is just a businessman who can't afford to do anything early."</p>

    <p>"Thank you Mr. Ducas for the reminder. We will be careful." Under the cloak, Sun Rong thanked him with a smile.</p>

    <p>She and Jiugong Liangzi naturally thought of this.</p>

    <p>As the successors of the Sun family and the Jiugong family, even though Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi are very young, they have personally experienced and experienced a lot of "wars" in the business circle since childhood.</p>

    <p>It is full of murderous intent and undercurrents. If you are not careful, you will be shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Zhu Yuanrun gave them the pass, Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi tacitly felt that Boss Zhu might have some other crooked ideas.</p>

    <p>"I won't say much if I have a lot to say. Thank you all for your help. It allowed me to realize what I dreamed of."</p>

    <p>Ducas showed a hearty smile. He handed over a gold name card he printed to each person: "Hahaha! This is my address in the core area. When you get there, you are welcome to come and play with me at any time."</p>

    <p>Then he stepped onto the luxurious carriage leading to the core area. Accompanied by a long neigh from the white spirit horse equipped with mechanical limbs in front of him, the carriage driven by Ducas' Black Butler headed towards the place of his dreams. Speed away quickly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at the carriage going away. He vaguely felt that a lot of things had happened. His eyebrows were furrowed and he felt a strong uneasiness in his heart.</p>

    <p>She's not like Wang Ling, nor Jin Deng. She's not in that realm of powerful foresight and calculation.</p>

    <p>However, because of Aohai's passive ability of "human and sword integration", her innate sixth sense as a girl has been infinitely amplified...</p>

    <p>This directly leads to Sun Rong having an ability similar to Wang Ling's "eyelid warning." It's a kind of "danger warning." Just not as accurate as Wang Ling's.</p>

    <p>"It's all destiny."</p>

    <p>Looking at Ducas going away, Monk Jin Deng sighed. He seemed to have figured out something.</p>

    <p>"Senior, did you figure something out?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Well, he is about to experience the disaster he is destined for. Even if the poor monk saves him now, nothing can be changed. It will happen sooner or later. It is better to face it sooner." Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>Unless it can reach a height like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, no one can have the ability to change their fate against the odds.</p>

    <p>Listening to Jin Deng's words. Sun Rong thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then she sighed: "No matter what Senior Jin Deng thinks, I think we still can't just sit back and ignore it... For Buddhist disciples, isn't it always their responsibility to save the common people?"</p>

    <p>When she said that. Sun Rong felt a little crazy.</p>

    <p>She's arguing with a Buddhist saint? It's unbelievable...</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong is right." Jin Deng was not convinced.</p>

    <p>"If you don't save that one person. How can we save the people?" Sun Rong continued.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng was stunned at first at these words. Then he laughed along with her: "Since Miss Rong wants to do it."</p>

    <p>He actually didn't expect Sun Rong to say these words.</p>

    <p>As the sage of Buddhism, it is impossible for him to argue or argue with a girl.</p>

    <p>And what Sun Rong said is actually not unreasonable.</p>

    <p>And... when I heard it, it was "Old Jiang Ziya"...</p>

    <p>After deciding on the next step, Sun Rong the three decided to take action immediately.</p>

    <p>They also boarded a luxurious carriage. But unlike Ducas, both the coachman and the carriage were hired.</p>

    <p>On the carriage. Sun Rong exchanged masks with Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the dangerous situation in the core area is unknown. Continuing to let Jiugong Liangzi play the role of "Gong" will make Sun Rong feel very dangerous. But she is different. Because of Aohai and Sun Ying'er's presence... There is still a little bit of self-protection ability.</p>

    <p>As for the reason for changing the mask, Jiugong Liangzi seemed very confused.</p>

    <p>On the carriage, she asked: "But I still don't understand. Why do you need to change the mask?"</p>

    <p>"It's confusion! To confuse Senior Zhuo!" Sun Rong casually made up a reason: "When you were fighting just now, I vaguely noticed that he seemed to recognize you."</p>

    <p>"Ah? Really? I pretend so well!"</p>

    <p>"Yes! So, exchanging masks now...maybe it can confuse people. And their next step will definitely be towards the core area. Let's go there first. It will help control the situation."</p>

    <p>"eh...Rongrong said it makes sense."</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Liangzi finished speaking, he couldn't help but sigh: "Hey, it was so dangerous. I almost got recognized..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhu Yuanrun stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window of his office. He stared at the only majestic-looking white jade avenue in the slum area with a specially customized high-power telescope.</p>

    <p>On the road, occasionally carriages passed by.</p>

    <p>This white jade avenue is the only road connecting the core area and the slums. It is heavily guarded. This is a specific entrance and exit. There is no other place to enter.</p>

    <p>The city wall in the core area is 60 meters high. There is a lightning barrier above the 60-meter city wall. It wraps the core area airtight like an egg.</p>

    <p>The bricks and tiles of the city wall are all specially customized. There is no possibility of illegal immigration.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhu, Ducas and Mr. Gong have already set off."</p>

    <p>After waiting in front of the floor-to-ceiling window for a while, Zhu Yuanrun heard the news delivered by his servant.</p>

    <p>"Very well. Everything is just as that lord planned." Zhu Yuanrun clasped his head.</p>

    <p>"That lord?" This servant was a little confused.</p>

    <p>"Otherwise? You think I'm that kind. To let them in with those expensive passes?"</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun said: "Although I bought these four passes through some means. However, that gentleman has already reimbursed me for all of them. And he also compensated me for all the losses in the casino. Because of the loss caused by Hei Long."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is... As expected of Mr. Zhu..."</p>

    <p>"What happens after that is none of my business. I'm not involved."</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun spread his hands. He leisurely said, "Next. It's time for that lord to perform."</p>

    <p>"A performance of what?"</p>

    <p>"Hei Long is the creator of the new mechanized cultivator... That Mr. Gong. He's a great talent. If we can replace his brain. I'll take him under my wing. He'll become a stronger fighter than Hei Long ."</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun laughed on Friday: "In this way. The template of the perfect mechanized cultivator that His Excellency has always wanted to design was born. After that. As long as it is put into mass production. We will be able to control everything."</p>
