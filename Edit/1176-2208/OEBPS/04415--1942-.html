  <h1>Chapter 1942 Li Chang blows milk</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After returning from the spirit world, Wang Ling's mood actually dropped a little. After all, he already knew that he was being targeted.</p>

    <p>And it's obvious that Mr. Teng is a very difficult character to deal with. If he makes the slightest mistake next, his true strength may be directly exposed.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling didn't think about upgrading the "Great Shielding Technique" or using physical/magical means to directly cause Teng Luchen to lose his memory.</p>

    <p>But after returning home, Wang Ling thought about it carefully and felt that it would be too rash to do it directly.</p>

    <p>After all, the opponent this time is different from the past. If the opponent had calculated in advance, if he would directly erase the memory. What backup method was left?</p>

    <p>Now that he is anxious to take action, he will only expose himself more quickly.</p>

    <p>In front of the desk. A faint light shone in from the window. Unknowingly, Wang Ling had been sitting in front of the desk until dawn after returning from the spirit world.</p>

    <p>There is still one month left in the overall preparation time for the Earth Center Project. This means that the two teams that will go to the Earth Center World will definitely be finalized within a month.</p>

    <p>Judging from what happened during the internal beta test of the spirit world, Wang Ling feels that he is doomed this time. And there are many dangers...</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>The phone vibrated.</p>

    <p>That was a message sent to him by Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>After the first closed beta test of Spirit World, he, Li Changzhe, and Zhang Linyan were added.</p>

    <p>As for Qu Shuling, he left directly after waking up. He didn't even say a word. He was as cold as ever.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan's reason was that she wanted to get to know Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it's okay to add it. Anyway, he basically doesn't post in Moments. There is no privacy concerns.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zhang Linyan received almost all his hints perfectly during the internal testing in the spirit world. She has the potential to be a scapegoat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it would be a good idea to add it.</p>

    <p>As for Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>That's just being thick-skinned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling in fact, he didn't want to add him at all.</p>

    <p>But he couldn't resist the fact that this guy was so familiar and shameless. He saw Zhang Linyan coming over to ask for WeChat, so he joined in too.</p>

    <p>And the most outrageous thing is that Li Changzhe kept staring at him when adding. It wasn't until he saw Wang Ling clicking the add button that he looked away.</p>

    <p>It was early in the morning. Wang Ling had not yet figured out how to deal with Teng Luchen. As a result, this shameless person sent him a text message.</p>

    <p>And there are only the words "Are you there?"</p>

    <p>These are the most annoying words for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He prefers the type of person who talks about something. He starts with "Are you there?." Wang Ling actually doesn't know how to continue.</p>

    <p>So when seeing these two words Wang Ling's inertia is to pretend that he didn't see it.</p>

    <p>Because if it is really urgent, they will definitely say directly instead of writing "Are you there?" and send it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. He just put down his phone. Then the phone vibrated like a ghost again.</p>

    <p>Or Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>"Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?"</p>

    <p>And as soon as he opened the screen. Wang Ling saw Li Changzhe posting a lot of messages in succession.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that if he didn't reply, he might be annoyed to death by Li Changzhe. He had no choice but to reply with an ellipsis.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe replied almost instantly: "What? It's true! [Baring teeth] It's okay. I'm just a little doubtful whether the WeChat account you gave me is genuine. I see that your circle of friends is blank. You haven't posted anything."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Now he really has the urge to block Li Changzhe directly.</p>

    <p>But this time, Li Changzhe turned an enemy into a friend.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that by blocking him now, he is actually making enemies for himself. It is completely unnecessary.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe is a bit naive and talkative, but he is still a good person in essence.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I have returned to Beijing. I came to Songhai temporarily. I came in a hurry and left in a hurry. It's a pity that I forgot to take a photo with you." Li Changzhe said on WeChat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hesitated to speak. He entered a string of ellipsis and then deleted it.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe saw on WeChat that it said "The other party is typing." But in the end the prompts disappeared Wang Ling and no information was sent. So he continued: "Actually, this is an internal beta test in the spirit world. At least it makes me think you're a pretty good person."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"By the way. Let me tell you one more thing."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe sent a message. He directly told Wang Ling: "That Qu Shuling. You have to be careful."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling finally changed the punctuation marks.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "Although we, Jingba and Shengke, are in an alliance, they are also in a competitive relationship. Don't look at the fact that I came to Songhai to find Qu Shuling this time. But in fact, I don't trust him very much. The relationship between me and him is also, it's not as good as outsiders say."</p>

    <p>Almost in an instant, Li Changzhe sent a long text.</p>

    <p>It's like clarifying the position with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling doesn't know what Li Changzhe means by sending these things to him.</p>

    <p>Could it be that during this trip to the spirit world, Li Changzhe was actually testing whether Qu Shuling was a reliable person?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the amount of information these paragraphs bring to him is quite large.</p>

    <p>If Li Changzhe is not lying, judging from the literal meaning, the alliance between Shengke and Jingba is not as stable as imagined.</p>

    <p>In other words, this alliance began to waver after Qu Shuling became the new student union president.</p>

    <p>After all, as Qu Shuling, who was specially trained by Shengke in recent years and is active in the public eye through various star-making means, in addition to being a cultivator in an orthodox high school college, he is also a veritable internet celebrity.</p>

    <p>Figures in the public eye are inherently controversial. This also allows Qu Shuling to always portray himself in a "pretty" state in front of outsiders, giving him a sense of superior genius.</p>

    <p>But this is such a person. During this internal beta test of the spiritual world, he did not use his leadership skills. He chose to go out alone and then made a fool of himself in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that there may be some hidden problem here.</p>

    <p>But what can be confirmed is that Qu Shuling really fainted at that time. And such coma could not be faked.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was thinking, Li Changzhe forwarded him another post on the cultivation forum.</p>

    <p>Someone posted anonymously on the forum claiming that he was a high school student selected for the internal beta test of the spirit world. During the competition, he saw Qu Shuling charging in alone as a lone wolf and then fainted. He did not wake up until the end of the test...</p>

    <p>This is a message in pure English. The IP address is from overseas.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed that in the comments below the post, the majority of people spoke up for Qu Shuling. Almost everyone who is familiar with this genius felt that this post was a way to ride on Qu Shuling's popularity.</p>

    <p>"You see it."</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe sent a message to Wang Ling and said: "Because it is an internal test, the official should have a video record, but it will not be made public. In the absence of conclusive evidence, no one will believe this is true."</p>

    <p>"Because Qu Shuling molded himself into a flawless person."</p>
