  <h1>Chapter 1303 Collective amnesia?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sunday, November 29th.</p>

    <p>Songhai First Military Medical Hospital.</p>

    <p>On that day, everyone felt as if they had intermittent amnesia...</p>

    <p>The thunder of the God of Punishment summoned by King's Eyes also contains the effect of "50% Great Oblivion."</p>

    <p>That's why.</p>

    <p>Those who witnessed the scene of the death of Heavenly Dao and Zhuo Yi holding the body of the girl as they rushed out of the hospital.</p>

    <p>Everyone has lost their memory of this period.</p>

    <p>Of course, lightning does not necessarily illuminate everyone.</p>

    <p>There's always someone in a blind spot. In a place where lightning can't shine.</p>

    <p>In this case. Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao had to split up again.</p>

    <p>Implement "physical amnesia" on those whose memories have not been erased.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and deathHeavenly Dao responded quickly.</p>

    <p>The last person to be subjected to "physical amnesia" was Boss Sun...</p>

    <p>When Mr. Boss Sun opened his eyes in a daze, the expression on his face was obviously panic.</p>

    <p>"Sneak attack! Someone sneak attacked me!"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun screamed in surprise. However, everything in front of him was calm as usual.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's physical body is still lying quietly in the medical cabin.</p>

    <p>And he was still holding his granddaughter's hand tightly, feeling the warmth from his palm.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun, don't panic. Everything is normal." Zhuo Yi stood on the side and reassured.</p>

    <p>He looked at the red mark on the back of Sun Yiyuan's neck. He tried to stay calm...</p>

    <p>"Senior, did you strike too hard..."</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space. Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "I can't help it. Mr. Sun was the last to be sentenced. It took a long time. The effect of physical amnesia cannot be guaranteed. So to be on the safe side, I had to hit him harder."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"What happened to me just now?" Mr. Boss Sun still felt like his memory was a bit out of place.</p>

    <p>And the key point is. His head hurts!</p>

    <p>It's like being hit by a million tons...</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. Mr. Sun just kept holding Sun Rong's hand. Then he seemed to be too tired and sad for a while, so he fell asleep accidentally." Zhuo Yi said nonsense seriously.</p>

    <p>"Did I fall asleep..."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun smiled bitterly: "I really made you two laugh."</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about, Boss Sun?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "Excuse me. Are you feeling uncomfortable?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun shook his head: "It's not particularly uncomfortable. It's just that when I took a nap, I seemed to have a very strange dream..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Strange dream?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun: "I dreamed that my neck seemed to have been run over by a dump truck."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi, Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>After the ancient Golden Men attacked Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi quickly contacted the Office of Strategic Deception and discussed with Boss Sun about starting to transfer the body.</p>

    <p>As long as it is beneficial to protect his granddaughter, Mr. Boss Sun will certainly not refuse.</p>

    <p>What's more, Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception are already strategic partners!</p>

    <p>Over there at the Office of Strategic Deception. Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is guarding the place. Sun Rong's physical body will definitely be safe there.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is Miss Bai Qiao here.</p>

    <p>Under such heavy protection, it is simply impossible for the ancient Golden Men to capture the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And in itself. The number of ancient Golden Men who escaped from the unspeakable land is very limited.</p>

    <p>More than 100 files have just been cleared by Wang Ling with one click.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for them to gather so many people in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>Of course. Regarding the incident of body snatching in the hospital just now...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like something is not quite right.</p>

    <p>"What is Ling Zhenren thinking?" Heavenly Dao drew the scapegoat very leisurely.</p>

    <p>Even though Sun Rong's soul is already protected by the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>He still didn't stop what he was doing.</p>

    <p>It's not about ten thousand, it's about what happens.</p>

    <p>What if the Golden Lotus is accidentally destroyed?</p>

    <p>Then this scapegoat actually becomes an insurance policy.</p>

    <p>It's just that now you don't have to draw it as hastily as when you first started.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling is really thinking about the hospital.</p>

    <p>Those appear suddenly.</p>

    <p>The ancient Golden Men are like the zombies in the movie "Train to Busan" that appear like crazy.</p>

    <p>He felt that this operation might not be as simple as it seemed.</p>

    <p>"Do you suspect there is someone behind this?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha asked while delivering the talisman to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>He did not give Wang Ling the ability to read minds.</p>

    <p>But at least I have lived with Wang Ling for such a long time.</p>

    <p>Regarding this man's thoughts, Er Ha can now guess some of them just by using tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling did not deny it. Heavenly Dao was quite surprised: "Brother Gou is amazing. You can guess all this!"</p>

    <p>"Where, where..." Er Ha was very humble.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Heavenly Dao said this, he was actually very sad inside!</p>

    <p>It's not easy to be a Heavenly Dao these days!</p>

    <p>Still? Not as good as a dog...</p>

    <p>As Er Ha said. Wang Ling does have his own suspicions.</p>

    <p>However, he had no direct evidence.</p>

    <p>Even if you want to raise an army to prosecute, you must have a good reason. Make the other party speechless before taking action.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling currently has two suspects.</p>

    <p>The first is the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void has always wanted Sun Rong to become the people of the Void and return to the Void.</p>

    <p>And he had left a prophecy domineeringly before.</p>

    <p>It is said that no matter what the final result is. Sun Rong will go to the void world...</p>

    <p>Therefore. The Lord of the Void has the motive to snatch Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>And with the ability of the Lord of the Void, although it cannot completely break the seal of the Unspeakable Land, it shouldn't be difficult to tear a small hole...</p>

    <p>He can make perfect use of the escaped ancient Golden Men to continue to retrieve the "Sons of the Void" for himself.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling suspected the second one.</p>

    <p>That is, the fortune teller who first calculated the "Yin and Yang Death Tribulation" for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, the identity of this person remains a mystery.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling. There is no clear conclusion yet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling even doubted it.</p>

    <p>This person. Maybe he is Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, in the void world.</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void sneezed hard while he was sleeping.</p>

    <p>"There must be someone talking about the Great Lord behind his back... By the way, has the Great Lord really torn the seal of the Unspeakable Land..." A voice of inquiry came from the side.</p>

    <p>Regarding this issue, the Lord of the Void fell into silence for a long time.</p>

    <p>He was faced with a dilemma.</p>

    <p>If the answer is no.</p>

    <p>This seems to affect his dignity to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>After all.</p>

    <p>The great Lord of the Void should be omnipotent.</p>

    <p>But if the answer is...</p>

    <p>His life may be threatened.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that he has no ability to break the seal of the unspeakable place...</p>

    <p>Regarding Wang Ling's behavior of "picking the shit basin." The Lord of the Void himself was also trembling.</p>

    <p>So after considering the above.</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void finally chose to survive.</p>

    <p>"Of course... it was not my fault..."</p>

    <p>Some virtual spirits were a little disappointed when they heard this.</p>

    <p>And some were aroused curiosity: "Who on earth broke the seal..."</p>

    <p>"This was an accident... one that no one could have imagined. An accident..."</p>

    <p>In the void world, a faint response from the Lord of the Void came.</p>
