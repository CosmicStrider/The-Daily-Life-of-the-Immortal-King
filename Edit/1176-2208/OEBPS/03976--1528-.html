  <h1>Chapter 1528 Wang Ling style gentleness</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that as long as he stayed still, the incomplete version of Talisman on his body would not be consumed.</p>

    <p>It turns out that Wang Ling made the wrong payment after all.</p>

    <p>Because the incomplete version of Talisman also has the function of inhibiting the backlash effect.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if you stand still, Talisman will still wear out due to the inhibitory backlash effect.</p>

    <p>Under Lan Mao's repeated attacks, Wang Ling already had an incomplete version of Talisman that began to smoke.</p>

    <p>He felt that he could no longer hesitate like this.</p>

    <p>Defeat the opponent earlier. Maybe it can reduce the wear and tear on these one-time incomplete Talisman.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>The next second, Wang Ling's figure disappeared directly in front of Lan Mao.</p>

    <p>He looked like a ghost. Lan Mao couldn't see Wang Ling's movements clearly.</p>

    <p>"This... is this the second gear..." Lan Mao was frightened.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he began to reflect on his arrogant behavior in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, he was too confident...</p>

    <p>I underestimated Wang Ling. That led to today's situation.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao was frightened by Wang Ling's momentum. At the same time, he was also shocked by the elegant figure of the young man in front of him.</p>

    <p>Compared with his previous series of fancy attacks.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's offensive. Not a trace of fancy.</p>

    <p>Simple and calm. But it also exudes a light sense of chicness.</p>

    <p>Isn't this the feeling he has been pursuing...</p>

    <p>In a state of confusion, Lan Mao felt his heartbeat speed up.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling tapped his finger on the back of his neck, Lan Mao closed his eyes: "Please be gentle to me. Houlang Sang..."</p>

    <p>At the same moment, the picture in the waiting room was interrupted and turned into a snowflake.</p>

    <p>This was done intentionally by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>When the picture returned, Lan Mao was lying on the ground with a calm and happy face. He looked like he was having a sweet dream.</p>

    <p>The referee ball issued the final result.</p>

    <p>--Wang Houlang. Win!</p>

    <p>Although no one in the waiting room knew exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>But Lan Mao lost to Wang Ling. This surprised many people.</p>

    <p>"Let me tell you. Houlang Sang will definitely win! The winning rate is 80%!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! Kongque's strength is not weak. In the previous duel with Kongque, Lan Mao's crazy evasion skills should have consumed a lot of physical strength."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! Houlang Sang is indeed the mascot of Number 60 High School!"</p>

    <p>In the waiting room, many promoted players and players in the loser group started discussing after seeing this.</p>

    <p>Only Kongque's eyes. Always ugly.</p>

    <p>Because he knows... Lan Mao's true situation...</p>

    <p>In the process of the opponent's duel with him, there is an element of acting.</p>

    <p>So there is no possibility that a lot of physical energy has been consumed as everyone thinks.</p>

    <p>But even under such circumstances...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still wins.</p>

    <p>This made Kongque very frightened.</p>

    <p>Houlang Sang's strength is unfathomable!</p>

    <p>Before leaving the field. Wang Ling checked Lan Mao's injury.</p>

    <p>That finger just now is called "Sleep Finger." It is the least lethal of all his moves.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the person who is hit has the effect of immediately falling into a comatose state. The effect is stronger than "Sleep Black Tea."</p>

    <p>Moreover, the moment Wang Ling tapped his finger, he also healed Lan Mao's injury.</p>

    <p>He discovered.</p>

    <p>In fact, I cannot be truly cruel.</p>

    <p>This is just a competition with the High School boy.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao is not an enemy.</p>

    <p>In fact, his nature is not bad. He just likes to play some tricks.</p>

    <p>After experiencing the battle just now, he believed that Lan Mao should have grown up than before.</p>

    <p>So he helped Lan Mao recover from his physical injuries.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of Wang Ling type of tenderness.</p>

    <p>Others can't learn it. They can't imitate it either.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Successfully advanced to the top 32.</p>

    <p>Next is the group showdown in the top 16.</p>

    <p>The team competition is all about. It's about all-round development of moral, intellectual, physical, social and aesthetic skills.</p>

    <p>The first round of screening. The test is "physicality."</p>

    <p>Then the second round of test is "wisdom."</p>

    <p>Therefore, there will also be some changes in the duel next time.</p>

    <p>The second round of testing is the "secret room."</p>

    <p>This is the Jiudaohe campus festival work carefully designed by the teachers of Jiudaohe High School. Every year, some adjustments and designs are made to the mechanism of the secret room.</p>

    <p>The entire secret room is as big as two football fields.</p>

    <p>And. In order to facilitate students' experience, the design of the secret room adopts a symmetrical design.</p>

    <p>It is divided into 8 entrances in total.</p>

    <p>That is to say.</p>

    <p>Although they enter through different entrances, everyone experiences the same level of the secret room.</p>

    <p>8 entrances. 8 people can enter at one time.</p>

    <p>So under ideal conditions, it only takes 4 times to complete the escape.</p>

    <p>Thirty-two contestants will be sorted from high to low based on the time it takes to successfully escape the Jiudaohe secret room.</p>

    <p>The top 16 people with the shortest time advance.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in order to prevent someone from getting stuck in the secret room and unable to get out, it will waste time.</p>

    <p>The allotted time for the second round is 4 hours.</p>

    <p>Everyone must complete the task within 4 hours. Otherwise, it will be regarded as being directly eliminated and entered into the loser group.</p>

    <p>Of course. To ensure fairness.</p>

    <p>This time, the cracking process inside the secret room will no longer be provided with real-time video. It will be watched by the other players waiting.</p>

    <p>The secret room mission is actually very familiar to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The girl still remembers the Heavenly Dao secret room that was originally cracked on the Heavenly Dao planet.</p>

    <p>No matter how difficult and terrifying Jiudaohe's secret room is... can it be as complicated as Heavenly Dao's secret room?</p>

    <p>Therefore Sun Rong is full of confidence.</p>

    <p>No worries at all.</p>

    <p>When Jisaki read out the rules for the second round through the central control room.</p>

    <p>Then comes the question and answer session.</p>

    <p>The girl who previously regarded Sun Rong as a thorn in her side. Matsushita Singha raised her hand and asked: "Can the door be violently broken down?"</p>

    <p>This question made Jisaki smile.</p>

    <p>He didn't answer no. He just said, "You can try."</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe secret room is not made of ordinary materials.</p>

    <p>The secret chamber inside has a complex structure. All structures are created with a material that can suppress spiritual power. After entering the Jiudaohe secret chamber, many people's strength will be greatly limited.</p>

    <p>It almost eliminates the possibility of cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage breaking into the door through violence.</p>

    <p>Jisaki reminded with a smile: "In addition, if you use magic such as walking through walls, it will be directly judged as cheating and you will be disqualified from promotion. So, I hope everyone will be more honest and don't think about those evil ways."</p>

    <p>After Jisaki finished speaking, he looked at the time.</p>

    <p>It's 8:04 pm.</p>

    <p>If the subsequent rounds of competition all go well.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe High School will be able to submit the top five list before noon tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards.</p>

    <p>Based on the lottery results of the system.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong. They were all selected in the first round.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. I'll wait for you at the exit."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong secretly sent a message to Wang Ling and walked in first.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hummed slightly.</p>

    <p>Then he also opened the curtain.</p>

    <p>Stepping into the extremely dark passage.</p>

    <p>At the same time. Wang Ling was also thinking of a strategy to clear the passage quickly.</p>

    <p>It's just a secret room.</p>

    <p>How hard can it be?</p>

    <p>Just take it apart and you're done...</p>

    <p>And the truth is. Until Wang Ling walked in. No one had realized the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>Many people think this "Houlang Sang" is a little puppy.</p>

    <p>But actually.</p>

    <p>Sometimes. He's also a husky...</p>
