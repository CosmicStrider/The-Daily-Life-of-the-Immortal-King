  <h1>Chapter 1986 Angry people don't live long</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Several spiritual guards didn't know what Dai Tianchun and Qu Shuling talked about inside.</p>

    <p>Surveillance equipment is useless in front of such a powerful person.</p>

    <p>Even though Dai Tianchun is not even an ant compared to Wang Ling. But on the current earth, Dai Tianchun's comprehensive combat power can be regarded as powerful and famous all over the world.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I don't know what they are talking about." The leader of the spiritual guard turned on the projection monitor on his watch and stared at the screen. There were doubtful voices from the team members around him.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling and Dai Tianchun were face to face. Qu Shuling was eating the food brought by Dai Tianchun honestly. No one made any strange moves between the two.</p>

    <p>Anyone with a discerning eye can understand that this is using sound transmission to communicate. And with Dai Tianchun's encryption level, ordinary sound transmission to decipher spells is of no use at all.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. As long as they don't do anything strange," the captain of the spiritual guard said.</p>

    <p>He knew that he could not decipher the conversation, so he was not interested at all in what exactly was said between the two.</p>

    <p>As long as Dai Tianchun doesn't do anything weird.</p>

    <p>And judging from the screen currently displayed on the monitoring equipment, the psychic energy fluctuation value in the room has always been maintained at 0.</p>

    <p>If someone in the house uses a spell, even a subtle spell with psychic energy fluctuations can be detected instantly.</p>

    <p>The captain of the spiritual guard stared at the screen for more than fourteen minutes. It was not until Dai Tianchun was about to leave the apartment that he quickly put away the projected screen.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Principal Dai. Fifteen minutes. No more, no less." Seeing Dai Tianchun come out as promised, the captain of the spiritual guard and his subordinates bowed to him.</p>

    <p>"Thank you all. Take good care of my students." Dai Tianchun smiled calmly and walked away.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he completely disappeared at the end of the corridor that the four spirit guards breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Everyone couldn't help but sigh. After all, it was the frightened Crazy Demon Dai who could bring such a heavy sense of oppression to people through just ordinary communication.</p>

    <p>"Captain, do you want to send this monitoring back to Jiutian Jingmi Institute for analysis?" A member of the Spirit Guard suggested.</p>

    <p>"Of course. And we must upload it immediately." The captain of the spiritual guard immediately replied.</p>

    <p>Everything. Just for the sake of caution.</p>

    <p>Although in the picture before, the teacher and student did not make any strange movements. Apart from using encrypted sound transmission technology to communicate, Qu Shuling just kept eating.</p>

    <p>And the data of the psychic monitoring equipment has always been 0. From all aspects, there is no fault to be found.</p>

    <p>However, as the captain of the spiritual guard carefully selected by Teng Luchen, he still felt an indescribable strange feeling towards Dai Tianchun's sudden appearance.</p>

    <p>But he didn't know why...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, this is the time when Number 60 High School is out. The surrounding elementary schools and kindergartens that are relatively close to Number 60 High School almost all end at this time. Therefore, the road in front of the main entrance of the school is often jammed.</p>

    <p>As the chief security officer of Number 60 High School, in addition to protecting the safety of students, I also need to be concerned about the road conditions in front of the campus.</p>
 
    <p>Death Heavenly Dao was wearing the uniform of the school security chief. A pair of white gloves gently tapped on the window of a medium-sized off-road vehicle.</p>

    <p>After the car window was lowered, he saw a bejeweled middle-aged lady with curly hair sitting in the driver's seat. She glanced at him impatiently: "What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>This attitude made Heavenly Dao very angry when he just took over the position of chief security officer of 60 High School. But he has calmed down a lot these days.</p>

    <p>Originally, he came to this position just to get closer to Wang Ling, to experience secular life, and to exercise his mind.</p>

    <p>Although it hasn't been that long now, he has still developed some willpower.</p>

    <p>At least when he hears this impatient tone, he won't get angry directly.</p>

    <p>As Heavenly Dao. How can he be like ordinary people?</p>

    <p>After sorting out his thoughts for a while, Heavenly Dao still looked at the middle-aged lady with a pleasant look.</p>

    <p>He said softly in the gentlest tone possible: "Hello, auntie, it's school time now. Parking is not allowed here."</p>
    
    <p>"What should I do if my baby is injured? The world is in chaos now. There are so many bad people!"</p>

    <p>"Auntie... your child is already there?"</p>

    <p>"18 years old, so what? Does that mean they're not babies anymore? They haven't even grown any hair yet. In the eyes of their parents, children will always be babies." The lady said exaggeratedly while patting her chest.</p>

    <p>"..." Death Heavenly Dao sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He thought to himself, perhaps the few spoiled adults in society today are the result of such excessive pampering...</p>

    <p>He's eighteen years old and still can't find his way home!</p>

    <p>"If Auntie wants to park, drive to the road in front and turn. There is a dedicated parking lot."</p>

    <p>"Ouch! That parking fee is so expensive! Anyway, he will come out quickly. I will pick him up and leave!"</p>

    <p>"Auntie, please don't make it difficult for me. This is the rule." Death Heavenly Dao continued to persuade me.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, even under such gentle advice, the middle-aged woman suddenly became angry: "From the very beginning, I've been holding back for so long! Who are you calling 'auntie'? Do I look that old? Can't you speak properly? Were you raised without manners?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao found out. For some particularly unreasonable middle-aged aunts, as long as they are unreasonable in their own affairs, they will suddenly change the topic and talk about other issues.</p>

    <p>But there is no other way. For people who don't listen, no matter how many good words they use to persuade them, it's just clich√©s to them.</p>

    <p>"Auntie, since you don't leave, I have to deduct points." At this time, Heavenly Dao stood solemnly outside the car. He still maintained a professional smile on his face, but he didn't know why he looked a little gloomy.</p>

    <p>"You think you are a traffic policeman. You are crazy!" Seeing this, the middle-aged lady quickly closed her window and continued to hide in the car and did her own thing.</p>

    <p>"Year 219."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Death Heavenly Dao almost immediately reported a number.</p>

    <p>This is his real occupational disease. Because almost every person he meets, Heavenly Dao can almost clearly see the number above the other person's head.</p>

    <p>That's right. This number indicates how many years of life this person currently has.</p>

    <p>"Illegal occupation of the road in front of the campus. It is invalid after advice. Fined 10 years of life." At this time, Heavenly Dao sighed silently and directly changed the number above the middle-aged woman's head to 209.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Ah. Grandma, are you okay?"</p>

    <p>At the school gate, an old man on crutches suddenly fell. A passing girl rushed over immediately. Without fear of being touched, she directly helped her up.</p>

    <p>She is a kind girl.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao nodded.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>He directly transferred these ten years of life to the girl who supported the old man.</p>

    <p>But after everything was done, he suddenly felt that the girl's face seemed familiar. It was as if he had seen it somewhere.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Isn't this person the alchemy genius girl from Shengke, Su Xingyue?</p>
