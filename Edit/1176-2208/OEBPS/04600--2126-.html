  <h1>Chapter 2126 The General of Novice Village</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time. Sun Rong soon received a new system task [limited time task: help the general of Fuyun Town develop the city to a higher level within 3 days. And recruit Wolong to develop in Fuyun Town]</p>

    <p>[Task reward: Unknown. Rewards will be given based on the city's development level in three days and the average rating of the recruited Wolong. The higher the level, the richer the reward]</p>

    <p>This was a mission that suddenly appeared. The moment the Fuyun Town general looked at him, a system prompt appeared in front of Sun Rong almost immediately.</p>

    <p>She discovered that the general from Fuyun Town didn't seem to talk much. And for some reason, he especially liked to wear a mask... He looked so much like him.</p>

    <p>Sun RongSuddenly felt that he had a mysterious power.</p>

    <p>In the past, some people always said that she had the field of Sun Rong. She could attract many people to surround her, allowing her nowhere-to-be-placed charm to be conveyed to everyone's sight, and then exude hormones.</p>

    <p>But later she discovered that her field was not effective for "autistic and sociophobic patients."</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong also feels that he seems to have a special bond with patients with autism...</p>

    <p>Even the NPCs encountered in the game are set in an autistic society.</p>

    <p>For a moment, she just thought that the general's temper was very weird. Although he had quite a personality, in terms of game settings, could a general who was afraid of social isolation be able to lead a good team?</p>

    <p>Maybe this is why the system gave her a mission to help assist the city's development?</p>

    <p>Helpless. Sun Rong had no choice but to accept.</p>

    <p>She took a step forward and looked at Wang Ling: "That general, do you want me to help you develop the town?"</p>

    <p>Under the mask of Huwei. Wang Ling was also surprised by Sun Rong's initiative to ask for help. He only said the word "en" and then put his hands behind his back and prepared to leave the general's mansion.</p>

    <p>"General. What arrangements will the young masters make later?"</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Liu Jun, the senior general with whom he had discussed Chinese painting before, bowed and asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Sun Rong. Trying to stay calm: "What's your name."</p>

    <p>He was still acting. He didn't let Sun Rong find out his identity.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly bowed and replied: "Subordinate. Sun Yiyuan."</p>

    <p>Her initial mission was to hide her true gender. So it was impossible to give her real name directly. It would be a bit too fake to just say Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But obviously Sun Rong reacts very quickly. Wang Ling is acting with her again. And Sun Rong is also acting with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Under the mask of Huwei, the corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. He didn't expect that Sun Rong would directly mention Boss Sun's name...</p>

    <p>"It all depends on Vice General Sun's arrangements." Then he looked at Liu Jun beside him and said.</p>

    <p>"Vice General Sun?" Liu Jun's expression was obviously stunned. A corporal was directly promoted to deputy general. He had the same rank... This made Liu Jun dumbfounded on the spot.</p>

    <p>This leap is indeed a bit too fast. But this is the general's intention, so it is not easy for Liu Jun to object in person.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the eighteen playful young masters in the General's Mansion were trained to be more united than ever before in the hands of the newly promoted Vice General Sun. Everyone even aroused a strong interest in learning.</p>

    <p>Not even the seven ladies in the backyard were able to do this. However, they were trained in an orderly manner by a soldier who was secretly rumored to be a woman. It was enough to show that he was a capable person.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Liu Jun stopped talking. Although he was surprised, he had to do as he was told.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After being promoted to Deputy General Sun, the surrounding NPCs were obviously very polite to Sun Rong. However, Sun Rong did not obtain a new identity given by the system.</p>

    <p>Because she does not have any items belonging to the deputy general in the game. Unless Wang Ling kills Liu Jun. And distributes Liu Jun's equipment to Sun Rong. Then re-orders. This is how to obtain the identity. Correct way.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as a loophole that can reveal that the general of Fuyun Town in front of him is not an NPC. But it is a pity that Sun Rong is still a little younger in terms of the game... and could not detect it in time.</p>

    <p>After arranging the subsequent courses for those eighteen children, Sun Rong also received a prompt to complete the system task. The task of hiding gender. After Wang Ling successfully verbally arranged for her to be the deputy general. Directly It is judged as completed by the system.</p>

    <p>This is one of the reasons why Sun Rong is paralyzed. Because she only thinks that the deputy general's identity in the game is not the key. It is the turning point that allows her to complete the novice mission.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a lot of experience poured in.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's character level has directly soared to level 20.</p>

    <p>She didn't think much about it. She directly added all the attribute points of level 20 to defense.</p>

    <p>Are you on full defense because you are afraid of pain? (bushi)</p>

    <p>This is what Sun Rong had in mind from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Let's review Sun Rong's [Sword to Skill] settings. The damage of all sword attacks will be reduced by 75%. Each time a sword weapon attack is received, the passive layer will be +1. At the same time, 1 point of agility and passive layer will be gained. The number also determines the number of controllable spirit swords.</p>

    <p>In other words, Sun Rong is in a state of full attribute defense. Agility can also be improved through exercises. And the agility attribute is the key to affecting attack speed and dodge rate.</p>

    <p>Coupled with a 75% sword damage reduction. Once the level increases, even if Sun Rong does not have much health, hitting her may only reduce her blood drop by drop. And it may be a miss in most cases... He was dodged directly because of his technique.</p>

    <p>And this... is the legendary attack speed Titan Sword Master!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With the help of Sun Rong, Sun Rong simultaneously gained part of the city control. However, each time the setting is completed, it needs to be reviewed by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This process seems quite redundant to Wang Ling. He has 100% trust in Sun Rong. Just agree to everything and that's it.</p>

    <p>The current available troop strength in Fuyun Town is 2,000, which is not as many as the employees of Huaguo Shuilian Group. Sun RongThe current position of deputy general is like the executive CEO of the group. To be honest, it makes her quite nervous.</p>

    <p>After all, she is only 17 years old. She has never been able to call so many people simultaneously at a certain moment. When Fuyun Town develops later, the number of people will probably be even greater than now.</p>

    <p>Expanding the city requires building resources. Then a part of the soldiers need to be detached to collect resources. Once the soldiers are detached, it means that the safety factor of the city will be reduced.</p>

    <p>In the Itinerant Immortal magic circle, a map with a low safety factor will definitely be attacked by external forces.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong was very careful in allocating it, it still received a system prompt soon.</p>

    <p>Just 12 hours later, the demon caves around Fuyun Town will gather demon spirits to attack here. The total number of demon spirits is about five hundred!</p>

    <p>"It's over..."</p>

    <p>After seeing the system prompt, Sun Rong sighed secretly. He just assigned 1,000 people. This was a conservative choice. In the end, he was still attacked.</p>

    <p>As a result, instead of blaming her, the general from Fuyun Town comforted her.</p>

    <p>"It's OK."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>He knew that the demon spirits would attack from the southern entrance of the town.</p>

    <p>So I didn't panic at all. I just stood with my hands behind my back and walked slowly towards the south.</p>

    <p>"General? Are you alone? Don't you need to send people to help defend?" Sun Rong was surprised. I didn't know if this NPC general wanted to die on purpose.</p>

    <p>Go there alone. This is not a proper death.</p>

    <p>"No need." Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>Then he opened his health bar value to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Sun Rong was training the children. and when he was on the road. Wang Ling never stopped practicing. He kept reciting the formula of "God descends to earth" silently in his mind.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, when Sun Rong saw the true health of Wang Ling, she was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling's health bar.</p>

    <p>[300000/300000]</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Why does a general from Novice Village... have 300,000 drops of blood!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knows the biggest map boss in the early stage near Novice Village. It only has 2000 HP!</p>

    <p>No matter how powerful the boss is, one with 10,000 HP is already as strong as the sky!</p>

    <p>And there are actually 300,000 generals in Fuyun Town!!!</p>
