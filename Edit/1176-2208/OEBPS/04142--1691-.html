  <h1>Chapter 1691 Wang Ming's Memory Crystal Card</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Master Wu Xin's death was tragic. When Wang Ling, Wang Nuan and his sister removed their palms, his body was completely out of shape.</p>

    <p>Because this supreme world is in a different space. It is not within the scope of the earth. It is a completely "outside the law." Therefore, Wang Ling didn't take much care when he started to act.</p>

    <p>If it were on Earth, according to the existing cultivation laws, you might be sentenced to "excessive defense" or...</p>

    <p>And he and Wang Nuan each have the same palm.</p>

    <p>The destructive power brought by this brother-sister combo's palm skills is too strong. It cannot be ended later.</p>

    <p>"The supreme world collapsed. It seems that Master Wu Xin is really dead." Xiang Yi felt the breath fluctuations in the space and then said.</p>

    <p>"After all, it was the palms of Ling Zhenren and Nuan Zhenren. The two of them slapped each other down. It was like the hearts of some young boys whose confession was rejected." At this time, Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>"A boy's heart?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The hearts of these boys are like crushed plastic bottles. Such trauma can never be repaired."</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily." At this time, Er Ha added.</p>

    <p>"Why did Mr. Zhuo say that?" Jin Deng was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it just a crushed plastic bottle? Just blow it and it'll be fine."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Among the people present, only Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi looked confused and confused.</p>

    <p>On the other side. Virtual Realm. In the Imperial City. Along with Wu Xin's death, the last group of people in the Imperial City who were still dealing with the unspeakable creatures also quickly received good news.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were sent to use a special small Corpse Map to contain the plans to contain the living beings. At this time, they had successfully completed the mission and returned victorious.</p>

    <p>Their movements were extremely fast. They followed Wang Ling's orders and instructions exactly. There was no sloppiness at all.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that this side was just preparing to resurrect Wang Ming. Master Wu Xin also stopped at the same time.</p>

    <p>The battle between masters is so unpretentious and boring.</p>

    <p>As expected of Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Even though Li Xian and Zhang Zhui had long expected how the winner of this battle would be distributed, they never expected that Master Wu Xin, who claimed to have activated 100% of his divine brain and was invincible, would die so quickly.</p>

    <p>"Minature Corpse Map. I'll trouble you two seniors to bring it to Ling Ling." Wang Ming has been possessed in Jia Bugui's body for some time. Moreover, he had undergone brainwave fusion before. His face looked a little strange at this time.</p>

    <p>"How is Mr. Ming? I think you feel very uncomfortable?"</p>

    <p>"It's just expected. After all, my brainwaves in this body are only a small part separated from the main body. I can't hold on for long." Wang Ming said: "In order to completely hide me, I contacted the origin of this body. The owner also performed will fusion. But as time goes by, the will of the original owner of the body will return, and I will be kicked out."</p>

    <p>"What now?"</p>

    <p>"In this Virtual Realm and this huge imperial city, I discovered some interesting things that are helpful to my own personal research." At this point, Wang Ming took out a blue crystal card from his clothes.</p>

    <p>This is a copy crystal card he made while Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were on a mission. It can copy his current brain wave state and transfer it to the card.</p>

    <p>"In this way, you can take this crystal card out with you. The crystal card contains some intelligence information that I have obtained in the Virtual Realm. When you return, just give it to my main body." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui looked at each other for a moment. Then they raised their hands and bowed: "Yes. Mr. Ming."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's current state is actually equivalent to a small clone technique. After the task is completed, the clone will disappear and the brain waves will also dissipate. This is a normal thing.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin was dealt with. This Virtual Realm and the entire imperial city were left unmanaged. The jurisdiction naturally fell into the hands of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei wants to wait until the management situation in the Imperial City is stabilized, and then hand it over to Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>If Huaxiu Alliance doesn't want it.</p>

    <p>At that time, we can directly use the geographical location to open an Office of Strategic Deception branch or something. Wang Ling snapped his fingers and relocated everyone to the Imperial City.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya has been waiting here for a long time.</p>

    <p>Although this mission was relatively successful, some people were still injured. Therefore, after receiving the clone notification from Li Xian and Zhang Zhui, he quickly entered the imperial city under the leadership of the two.</p>

    <p>Now the Imperial City is in chaos. With order undetermined, the gates of the Imperial City passages are wide open. Countless rich people in the core area drive their carriages to the slums, and start fighting for safety with the poor people there.</p>

    <p>Of course, these problems will be solved after the Office of Strategic Deception is fully taken over, helping this technology city to restore peace as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Chaos Rudder was also brought back.</p>

    <p>After seeing his master suffer such a tragic death, Chaos Helm was not stupid. He knew that it would be useless if he insisted on resisting.</p>

    <p>So. The instrument spirit of the Chaos Ship made a voice for the first time. There was a hint of fear in the voice: "Don't... don't make me into a milk bottle..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha rolled his eyes: "It's just made into a milk bottle. I'm not trying to kill you. I was still a toad back then. It's actually pretty good to change my body shape."</p>

    <p>"This... but I still don't want to be made into a baby bottle..."</p>

    <p>"My master is kind and kind. Making you into a milk bottle is to give you a chance for redemption. Otherwise, tell me, what use are you?"</p>

    <p>"But there are many materials in the world that can be used to make baby bottles..."</p>

    <p>"But they are not as strong as you."</p>

    <p>Er Ha continued to persuade with sincerity: "My master likes you. It is you who give you face. As for the other materials you mentioned, they are nothing more than those pure paper straws in milk tea shops. They can't be inserted. They can't be sucked. Halfway through. It will also become soft."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Of all the people in the room, only Sun Rong and Liangzi Jiugong looked confused and didn't know what to think.</p>

    <p>"So. I advise you to give up resistance." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Rudder is desperate. Its function is to change the trajectory of all things. If it becomes a milk bottle... Its function will also change with the change of appearance.</p>

    <p>"Ya, ya, ya!" At this time, Wang Nuan suddenly said again.</p>

    <p>As an expert in "baby language" at level 10, Er Ha quickly translated the meaning of Wang Nuan's words: "Nuan Zhenren said that we won't change your role. Even if it's a milk bottle, it can still be a rudder. Just empty your body ..."</p>

    <p>"Empty..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. Hollow it out and make it look like a container. Then just add a pacifier on top. When you drink it, you can hold it while you drink it. This way, it will be safer to drink."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Chaos Helm sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>It knows that by now, it is doomed.</p>

    <p>It will 100% br made into a bottle that it cannot escape.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it has no room for struggle or resistance.</p>

    <p>As for the Office of Strategic Deception, most of the others are treating this matter with a spectator mentality.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is one person who is thinking about other things at this time.</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong is thinking about Wang Ling's birthday gift.</p>

    <p>It's just that she hasn't decided what to give yet.</p>

    <p>If possible...</p>

    <p>She would love to pack herself up and send herself away!</p>
