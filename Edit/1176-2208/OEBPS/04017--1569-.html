  <h1>Chapter 1569 What to buy after having one million</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zheng fell to the ground. It was completely beyond the monk's expectation.</p>

    <p>Compare functions with Ling Zhenren. And you dare to go so deep... If you don't close your eyes, who will?</p>

    <p>Because of personal experience, the monk deeply knows the horror of this ability.</p>

    <p>This time. It was Zheng who miscalculated.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng counted the time on his fingers. Zheng will take a long time to wake up from his sleep.</p>

    <p>However, the other party is too hostile to me and is always trying to drive me away.</p>

    <p>After much thought, the monk felt that it would be the safest way to let Zheng temporarily close his eyes for now.</p>

    <p>There are still many things in this universe that Zheng is responsible for handling. Now is not the time to let Zheng die in vain.</p>

    <p>"Monk. You deliberately let him..." Peng Xiren is not stupid. He can probably see the monk's intention.</p>

    <p>But I still can't figure out why the monk did that.</p>

    <p>"You are in trouble." The monk looked at him and said.</p>

    <p>"Causing trouble?" Peng Xiren couldn't help but have a puzzled look on his face when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he gave a bitter smile. There was a hint of caution in his eyes: "Now I am just a wisp of soul. What else do you want, monk."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng just felt sorry for Peng Xiren's persistence.</p>

    <p>However, the monk always believed that when Dao Ancestor Wang chose Peng Xiren as his true disciple... this move must have had ulterior motives.</p>

    <p>No matter what situation we encounter next, Peng Xiren still needs to exist.</p>

    <p>This is the best situation that the monk has calculated so far.</p>

    <p>"You still don't realize the seriousness of the problem."</p>

    <p>The monk stared at Peng Xiren and said: "You have underestimated the horror of that evil god. Dao Ancestor went through all the trouble to ban him back then. It makes sense. If you release him, you will definitely cholera the universe."</p>

    <p>"As long as the Sky Tomb is still in my hands, what can he do? He is just a shark with its teeth pulled out."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren finished.</p>

    <p>I saw the monk just looking at him quietly without saying a word.</p>

    <p>After the scene was silent for a moment, Peng Xiren's expression suddenly changed and he sat slumped on the ground.</p>

    <p>"It seems you finally thought of it." The monk said.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren looked flustered. Sweat dripped from his cheeks due to nervousness.</p>

    <p>He thought about it.</p>

    <p>My own body...</p>

    <p>It's still in Star Eater's space.</p>

    <p>Although he has been hiding the location of the tomb, if the evil god uses his body, even if he doesn't say anything... he can still find the tomb.</p>

    <p>Although that man's strength is not as good as before, he still has such ability.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren knows this clearly.</p>

    <p>But Peng Xiren still can't believe it. He would be deceived by Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>"I had a soul contract with him! There's no way he could betray me!" Peng Xiren screamed.</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together and sighed: "Do you know why Dao Ancestor couldn't kill him completely in the first place. Instead, he chose to peel him in half and seal him separately?"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was stunned.</p>

    <p>Because of this. He really never thought about it.</p>

    <p>Given the character of his master, to deal with such an evil god, if there was a way to completely destroy him, he would definitely not use a roundabout method like sealing him.</p>

    <p>Only by completely eradicating the evil and evil things in this world can we avoid future troubles.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng knew the truth.</p>

    <p>But it is useless to talk about these things at this moment...</p>

    <p>The location of the Sky Tomb was found by Fenmu Shen. That proves that the other party is about to merge with the other half sealed in the Sky Tomb.</p>

    <p>"Poor monk, it's time to set off." At this time, the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Monk! I'll go with you!" Peng Xiren also stood up.</p>

    <p>"Just stay in this astrolabe and wait until Zheng wakes up. With your current fighting power, you just died in vain in the past. Maybe you will become the food of Fenmu Shen." The monk said.</p>

    <p>"But you can win the fight if you go?" Peng Xiren frowned.</p>

    <p>"Poor monk. We can delay it for a while."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng's expression. He looks fearless.</p>

    <p>The extremely thin threads he condensed with his spiritual power penetrated Peng Xiren's soul and bound him tightly. Linked to Zheng.</p>

    <p>Although there are also restrictions placed by Zheng in the astrolabe. It can completely prevent Peng Xiren from escaping.</p>

    <p>However, Jin Deng still feels that double insurance would be safer.</p>

    <p>"Monk... what are you doing!" Peng Xiren tried to struggle.</p>

    <p>However, the monk had made up his mind. His attitude was so firm that Peng Xiren could not imagine: "Stop talking. If you dare to say even half a word, I will tie you up with a tortoise shell."</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Peng Xiren shut up obediently.</p>

    <p>The monk is expected to have Peng Xiren's character. He would definitely not be able to accept such a shameful gesture.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Monk Jin Deng felt that time was almost up.</p>

    <p>Then he shrunk to an inch and left the vast astrolabe where Zheng lived.</p>

    <p>Buddha said: If I don't go to hell, who will?</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng knew deeply that his battle with Fenmu Shen might not be delayed for too long.</p>

    <p>This battle is destined to be a battle in which he jumps back and forth on the edge of hell.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the monk feels that he does not need to hold on for too long...</p>

    <p>Just wait until the game on Ling Zhenren's side is over.</p>

    <p>No matter whether he goes to hell or not.</p>

    <p>Then Fenmu Shen must die...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe's exclusive player waiting room. Wang Ling returned victoriously.</p>

    <p>Next to him lay a pile of baby magazines.</p>

    <p>The bonus of 1 million Sun Island Coins is a lot of money for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Participating in competitions was originally prohibited in Old Wang's family, especially if it came with a bonus. But this time it was a closed-door meeting. Relatively speaking, the problem was not too big.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important key to the problem is that Wang Ling used his own abilities to win the game.</p>

    <p>So with the help of Wang Ming, Wang Ling worked very hard to reduce his combat power to the same level as his peers.</p>

    <p>At least in terms of breath.</p>

    <p>It's the same...</p>

    <p>But to be honest, despite all the preparations, Wang Ling actually had no sense of participation.</p>

    <p>Because most of the people in the venue are Gray Cult believers.</p>

    <p>As soon as they saw that the opponent was him, they tried every means to torture themselves. Whenever they disagreed, they started thinking about "fixing the match."</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling is just like that. It goes directly to the last level.</p>

    <p>As for the mental battle, Wang Ling doesn't think he can use his own abilities.</p>

    <p>That person fainted when he saw the function in his mind. Can you blame him?</p>

    <p>All I can say is that this is caused by poor academic skills.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling now feels that he is a bit excessive.</p>

    <p>Obviously the game is not over yet.</p>

    <p>But I am already thinking about how to spend the 1 million Sun Island coins to buy gifts for Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>But to Wang Ling, this money is indeed like picking it up for free...</p>

    <p>There is not much suspense anymore.</p>

    <p>Before Mother Wang was pregnant with Ah Nuan. Wang Ling actually had a little resistance in her heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if Ah Nuan's birth would be another disaster for the earth and the universe...</p>

    <p>But as the day of breaking out of shell approaches.</p>

    <p>Regarding the new member that is about to welcome the Old Wang family. Wang Ling suddenly felt a different kind of emotion arise in his heart.</p>

    <p>Until he came to Sun Island. And decided to participate in the competition. The moment when Wang Nuan prepared the prize money to buy gifts...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally realized it more deeply.</p>

    <p>My own attitude towards this upcoming sister.</p>

    <p>He couldn't tell what it was.</p>

    <p>But the joy was the same as when he saw the limited edition dry noodles.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, there is a new problem.</p>

    <p>That is, with 1 million Sun Island coins. What should I buy for my sister...</p>

    <p>He didn't know about this little girl either.</p>

    <p>Do you like eating crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>If you don't like it.</p>

    <p>How about training it?</p>
