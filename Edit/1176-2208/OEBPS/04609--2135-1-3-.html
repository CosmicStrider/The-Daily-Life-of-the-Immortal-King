  <h1>Chapter 2135 Sun Rong's ability to apply knowledge to new situations</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Now let us take a look at the multiple identities that Wang Ling has obtained so far: [Waste Chai], [Prison Leader], [General Chen of Fuyun Town], [Ten Cave Demon Lord of Fuyun Town] and [Fuyun Town] Demon Lord of Hundred Cave], [Wolong Recruiter]</p>

    <p>Even excluding the initial professional identity of [waste]. Wang Ling now has five identities obtained through various adventure missions and hidden missions.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself doesn't know why he can develop to this point just by playing a game.</p>

    <p>But now that Lao Huang has joined, he finally has an old player who can help him play with some of the things he doesn't understand about the game.</p>

    <p>Although it seems that Lao Huang is very doubtful about whether his identity as an NPC is real. But Wang Ling also knows that this matter cannot be hidden for a long time. He is just an ordinary high school student. He is not an acting major.</p>

    <p>So now this situation can only be concealed for a while. When the time is right, Wang Ling will choose to take the initiative to show off his cards. Or when the time is right, he will reveal his flaw and let Lao Huang and Sun Rong take the initiative to discover his true identity...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, the current identity hiding is of greater strategic significance.</p>

    <p>Neither he nor Sun Rong knew Lao Huang before. But Lao Huang's familiarity made neither Wang Ling nor Sun Rong feel too disgusted. It even made Wang Ling feel a little bit like this. A mature and advanced version of Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao also has a natural flair for making friends, but Lao Huang clearly handles this "natural flair" attribute perfectly, without making it feel out of place at all.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly. Wang Ling and Lao Huang have a feeling of being old friends at first sight.</p>

    <p>He has four pieces of functional equipment given to him due to bugs. Only two pieces are currently displayed. One mask and one cloak. And they are never worn out. They have no durability. They are permanently bound to the body and will not be affected by death.</p>

    <p>These attributes alone can make most players cry with envy.</p>

    <p>As a veteran player, Lao Huang knows a little bit about everything. He guided Sun Rong in the sandbox operation of urban reconstruction. And Sun Rong also learned very quickly.</p>

    <p>In addition to making more reasonable adjustments to the distribution of troops in Fuyun Town, Sun Rong also used the surrounding resources collected by the 5,500 demon spirits sent out to start urban construction and changes to Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>"Why did Miss Sun choose this place to expand the city?"</p>

    <p>"The terrain at the east gate of the city is complex. It is easy to defend but difficult to attack. The security is fully guaranteed." Sun Rong answered.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang nodded. He sighed inwardly that a boy can be taught. In fact, he didn't teach Sun Rong much.</p>

    <p>Almost all of them only spoke a sentence or a half. Sun Rong began to use the ancestral brain supplement model to start learning on her own. He really didn't help much. He just clicked...</p>

    <p>As a result, Lao Huang discovered that this girl's ability to draw inferences from one instance to other cases was really strong. It was almost to an outrageous level.</p>

    <p>Based on Lao Huang's experience, he felt that Miss Sun was not a simple character even if she were placed in reality.</p>

    <p>And there's this name...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan...</p>

    <p>Sounds so familiar!</p>

    <p>He seems to have heard it somewhere!</p>

    <p>"By the way, Lao Huang. Is it okay if we hire local residents for urban construction?" At this time, Sun Rong suddenly had a bold idea.</p>

    <p>The only issue that urban residents need to consider is the consumption of food. As long as they can keep their stomachs full.</p>

    <p>Now the job of the demon spirits is to collect materials for city construction, cultivate fertile fields, enrich granaries, and ensure the logistics operation of the entire Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>On the defensive side, it's the soldiers' job.</p>

    <p>But in addition to defense, soldiers can also participate in city construction. In addition to ensuring food, they also have to pay additional employment fees. This is a large expense. It makes Sun Rong feel very uneconomical.</p>

    <p>It would be best if the residents can participate. It can save employment fees. As long as the food can keep up.</p>

    <p>And allowing residents to participate in construction can actually improve the happiness index of the city. After all, if cities and towns develop well, the ultimate beneficiaries of the upgrade are the residents.</p>

    <p>The food problem is just a logistical problem that the city leader needs to solve.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, Sun Rong's idea is also very clear.</p>

    <p>"Involve residents in the construction. Food is very important. So when the time comes, we need to gather the residents involved in the construction in one area. Then improve the welfare level of that area. This will encourage more residents to participate voluntarily."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "The demon clan went to reclaim fertile fields to replenish the granary. This only solved part of the logistical problem. Someone still needs to transport the food to the homes of the residents who participated in the construction. Otherwise, the food will not be distributed well. It will just pile up there and rot."</p>

    <p>"If food spoilage occurs, there is a high probability that some speculators will emerge. And when these speculators see a profit, they will open private granaries and sell the food they have to residents at high prices. At the same time, it will also hinder the transportation work. It will deliberately let the good food spoil."</p>

    <p>"So for these people, it is best not to sell food in single portions. They wish that residents could join together to buy in groups..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Another round of careful reasoning and wonderful inferences. Wang Ling was stunned when he heard this. Even Lao Huang was dumbfounded on the spot.</p>

    <p>Someone is needed to carry the food. Lao Huang thought of this. But what he didn't expect was the things Sun Rong said later.</p>

    <p>After all, in the world of Itinerant Immortal, every NPC has its own consciousness. It is controlled by intelligent AI. They have their own learning ability and will continue to grow. Characters will be randomly assigned to them according to the system. Character determines your own behavior pattern.</p>

    <p>So the things Sun Rong said may actually happen. They are not alarmist.</p>

    <p>In the virtual game world. This series of reasoning sounds magical. But sometimes the real world is not a magical world?</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do?" At this time, Wang Ling, who had been sitting firmly on the general's throne, finally spoke.</p>

    <p>He found that he hadn't spoken for a long time. It was an abnormal phenomenon for NPCs. So taking the initiative to speak at this time might dispel some of Sun Rong, Lao Huang's doubts about himself.</p>

    <p>Obviously. Sun Rong did not expect that this taciturn general would suddenly ask her a question. She only thought it was a mission issue. After thinking about it carefully, she truthfully expressed her thoughts: "If you want to save money, Residents need to complete the construction themselves. This requires a complete mechanism to ensure the food supply chain, that is, the speed of logistics. It must never be stopped."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang: "So?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Lao Huang. Finally she looked at Wang Ling and said: "So I suggest that the next step should be taken by the General's Mansion. Priority should be given to building a courier hall responsible for transporting supplies and food! I think. Let's call it Jingfeng Mansion! Jing as fast as thunder. Feng as fast as the wind!"</p>
