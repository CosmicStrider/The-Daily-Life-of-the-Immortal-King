  <h1>Chapter 1518 The blackened Ma Jiao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming originally wanted to take advantage of Ma Jiao's admiration for him, but instead used Ma Jiao to settle the matter of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Ming never expected was that Ma Jiao was actually a silky chicken...</p>

    <p>Due to the lack of overall understanding of Ma Jiao, Wang Ming seemed to have made a serious error in his judgment this time.</p>

    <p>And more importantly, Wang Ming did not realize how serious the next problem was.</p>

    <p>Wednesday, December 16th.</p>

    <p>It was early in the morning at Jiudaohe High School. Ma Jiao stayed up all night.</p>

    <p>As the vice president of the student union, she issued a curfew order so that students gathered around Wang Ling could quickly evacuate.</p>

    <p>And she herself was busy all night in the student union office, preparing a plan to completely "hide" Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In a vice president's work manual.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao wrote down in detail the plan to kill and dispose of corpses that she was about to implement.</p>

    <p>Now, there are no more people around Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>As long as she acts according to her plan, she can definitely kill Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>Anyway, this isn't the first time.</p>

    <p>When she wrote the part about dumping the body, Ma Jiao frowned.</p>

    <p>A cultivator in the Foundation Building stage with a normal weight can quickly dissolve the body with 50g of primary corpse powder.</p>

    <p>Considering the possibility that Houlang Sang may have hidden strength.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao took out the high-grade corpse powder she kept at the bottom of the box.</p>

    <p>This advanced corpse powder can dissolve even Golden Core cultivators quickly.</p>

    <p>However, there is a prerequisite for corpse powder. That is to ensure that the object used must be dead...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it will fall on a living person.</p>

    <p>The effect of corpse powder is actually not much different from that of baby powder.</p>

    <p>Secondly, if you use corpse powder, how to clean up the remaining traces.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, there are actually many methods for detecting corpses.</p>

    <p>Even if the body is cleaned up, if traces of the use of corpse powder are detected, evidence may still be left.</p>

    <p>To this end, Ma Jiao further prepared a "full-effect cleaning reagent."</p>

    <p>She got it from a scumbag forensic doctor who tried to kill her.</p>

    <p>Forensic identification work in the world of cultivation. After each autopsy, the autopsy room must be further disinfected and cleaned.</p>

    <p>And "all-purpose cleaning reagent" is a must-have for forensic medicine.</p>

    <p>Just to be on the safe side.</p>

    <p>After the corpse powder has completely dissolved the corpse, just drop a drop and all traces of the scene will be completely cleaned up.</p>

    <p>Prepare all plans.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao closed the workbook with satisfaction. A stern smile appeared on her face: "Senior K, I will be able to complete the task soon..."</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the dormitory, Wang Ming, who was lying on the bed with Zhai Yin, suddenly trembled uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>"Be honest. Why are you shaking... You've been rubbing behind me for a long time. You hooligan..." The bed in the dormitory is not big. Zhai Yin was squeezed in by Wang Ming, with half of her body pressed against the wall.</p>

    <p>He said he was disgusted, but he never pushed the man behind him away.</p>

    <p>"We are already an old married couple. Why are we so embarrassed?" Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>Then, his body trembled again: "I'm sorry, Yinzi. I don't know what's going on. It just feels like something is wrong."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin sat up and said, "Did you make a wrong decision? In the past, when you did experiments, you would shudder like this when you felt the results were wrong."</p>

    <p>"It's possible." Wang Ming was like a wolf dog. He suddenly trapped Zhai Yin: "My wrong decision may be that I didn't deal with you on the spot."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin took a deep breath and glared at Wang Ming angrily.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>Men. Sure enough, they are such creatures who push themselves to the limit!</p>

    <p>"I'm telling you, be honest. If you're not honest, don't even think about touching me in the future."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin blushed and folded the quilt up like an egg roll. There was no gap left for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and hugged Zhai Yin directly with the quilt: "Yinzi, I suddenly remembered... what you just said. I suddenly felt that Ma Jiao seemed a bit weird."</p>

    <p>"You mean the vice president of the student union?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin thought for a moment and said, "Rongrong was texting me just now. He said that this girl is very sinister and full of evil ideas."</p>

    <p>"I'm worried that she will be harmful to Ling Ling..."</p>

    <p>"You, I think you are just worrying. My brother has Soul Formation. There is nothing to worry about."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ming was mainly worried that something might go wrong with Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Before taking action against Wang Ling, this was still a living Ma Jiao. But after taking action, it may not be the same...</p>

    <p>Shadow Stream's signature is still there.</p>

    <p>You must know. The three brothers' bones are still cold...</p>

    <p>But then again. After Wang Ming heard that Zhai Yin thought Wang Ling was only in the Soul Formation realm, he couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Yinzi...Actually, Ling Ling is stronger than you think. He doesn't just have Soul Formation..."</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin thought that his ears heard it wrong. He immediately said in shock: "Sixteen years old...Itinerant Immortal?"</p>

    <p>"I don't want to lie to you Yinzi. You can be more bold." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"This, this, this..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was immediately shocked and became incoherent: "It can't be. True Immortal, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes...and no. Just pretend it's okay."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thought for a while and said.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not easy for Zhai Yin to make such an inference.</p>

    <p>After all, the strongest upper limit currently known on Earth is True Immortal.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei on True Immortal. is just an example.</p>

    <p>16-year-old True Immortal. This is something that many people think is impossible.</p>

    <p>But in the future, the upper limit of the highest level of cultivators on earth will usher in new changes.</p>

    <p>After all, the earth has been upgraded. There is no need to worry about the lack of spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>As long as it develops for several thousand years, it will be a Number 2 Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>"Look at your expression... Could it be that my brother's strength is at a level that I don't know about?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin looked at this serious expression and was shocked again.</p>

    <p>You can tell by his appearance. You're not lying to yourself...</p>

    <p>She was still curious: "So how strong is it?"</p>

    <p>"From a data perspective, the combined strength of all the cultivators on this earth is not enough for him to fight alone." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>This is still an understatement.</p>

    <p>He is very aware of his brother's strength.</p>

    <p>It's just the earth...if you include the universe, it's the same thing.</p>

    <p>But the concept of the universe was too broad. He felt that Zhai Yin might not be able to digest it for a while.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming held Zhai Yin in his arms, who opened his mouth in shock: "Yinzi. Now you know why I am obsessed with sealing Talisman's research, right?"</p>

    <p>"knew..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was hugged and shivering: "You are sealing the nuclear bomb."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the early morning, Ma Jiao entered the boys' dormitory building carrying a toolbox.</p>

    <p>The dormitory aunt on duty downstairs saw that the person who came was Ma Jiao. She quickly greeted her warmly: "Little Ma Jiao! Thanks to you this time! The group of students from before suddenly came over and almost broke the door! Still! What you students can say works!"</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, Auntie." Ma Jiao smiled. Then she took out a package of beautifully packaged things from the bag and put it on the table in the duty room: "This is top-quality yokan. Auntie worked hard on duty. I hope Auntie will accept it."</p>

    <p>The dormitory aunt immediately laughed and said, "Then I'm not welcome! We are still sensible!"</p>

    <p>Seeing Ma Jiao looking around, she hurriedly asked, "What are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>"Registration manual." Ma Jiao said: "When I enter the boys' dormitory, I have to register, right?"</p>

    <p>"Young man. Ma Jiao is so outspoken. You must be here to visit your boyfriend, right? Don't be polite to auntie. Auntie understands. Just go in." The dormitory aunt smiled. Her hands were already busy. Without mentioning it, I opened the yokan wrapping paper and started eating.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Thank you, Auntie." Ma Jiao smiled politely.</p>

    <p>When turning around.</p>

    <p>Her smile quickly faded.</p>

    <p>Just now, if this aunt asked her to register.</p>

    <p>She would consider "hiding" the dormitory aunt as well.</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao turned her attention to the elevator at the end of the first floor.</p>

    <p>And now. The boy she needs to "hide" is upstairs...</p>
