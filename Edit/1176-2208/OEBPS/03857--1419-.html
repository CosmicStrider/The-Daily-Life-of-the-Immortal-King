  <h1>Chapter 1419 Before the Sword Conference</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong When he got home, he found Sun Ying'er lying on the bed as if he had lost his soul.</p>

    <p>It looks like he must have fought the Master of Shadows for hundreds of rounds last night and was released not long ago...</p>

    <p>"How are you?" Sun Rong walked over and gave Sun Ying'er a shot of {Waist Cooling Technique} on the waist.</p>

    <p>This is a new spell that the girl developed on her own. It can cool down the waist joints when necessary, thereby reducing pain.</p>

    <p>She discovered that {cooling technique} actually has many uses. Not only can it calm down the mind, but it can also be used as a stress remedy after some injuries and strains.</p>

    <p>Even in a certain sense, {cooling technique} can significantly reduce the frequency of assaults on women at home and abroad.</p>

    <p>And it turns out that Sun Rong is really far-sighted.</p>

    <p>Because in the near future. {The "Cooling Technique" has really evolved into a new generation of anti-sexual techniques for women. And it's called "Ice Bird Technique!" It is said that the name was thought up by the person who developed {The Thunder Method - Thousand Birds}...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Chinese culture is broad and profound. They are both birds, but they have completely different meanings.</p>

    <p>"Does it hurt?"</p>

    <p>After Sun Rong finished applying the {cooling technique}, he gently massaged Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>"Hey Rongrong! I'm all pretending! You must have been fooled!"</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, at this time, Sun Ying'er suddenly turned over and pushed Sun Rong onto the bed. She put her hands on both sides of Sun Rong's head and looked straight at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The breath was so close that it could hit Sun Rong's cheek. The girl took a deep breath. The expression on her face was much calmer than Sun Ying'er imagined.</p>

    <p>"Eh? You're actually immune? Shouldn't you be blushing under normal circumstances?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said strangely. Then she nodded with satisfaction: "Ah! It's all my credit! It's worthy of me! Under my careful training, Rongrong's face has become thicker now! I chase Ling Zhenren for Rongrong. Buried The foreshadowing has been laid!"</p>

    <p>"I discovered Ying'er. You just need to be dealt with... No wonder the Master of Shadows likes to bully you so much."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked helplessly at the person in front of him: "There are important things today. It's the day of the Sword Conference. We can't delay. You start first. Be good."</p>

    <p>"Okay Rongrong. You seem to be immune to ordinary teasing now. Now I must give you intensive training."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er's eyes rolled around.</p>

    <p>She made a fierce seal, turning herself into Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But the voice was still her own: "Come! Rongrong! Let's kiss!"</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. You've gone too far!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong struggled to push Sun Ying'er away. Finally, his face couldn't help but start to get hot.</p>

    <p>She thought she was used to it.</p>

    <p>But God knows where this girl Sun Ying'er came from so many dramas...</p>

    <p>"Do not make any random movements."</p>

    <p>At this time, accompanied by a falling golden light, Er Ha's figure appeared in front of the two women.</p>

    <p>When it landed. Er Ha brought Wang Ying's new rules.</p>

    <p>It looked at the scene in front of it. It felt that the picture was too beautiful.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's {Shapeshifting} has not been lifted yet. She still has the face of Wang Ling. But she is still wearing Sun Ying'er's iconic black and white skirt...</p>

    <p>The leader of his family was actually forced to dress up as a woman!</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha also knows that everything is fake, why is it still so annoying to look at it?</p>

    <p>I have to say, this Sun Ying'er is very courageous...</p>

    <p>Seeing the arrival of Er Ha. Sun Rong seemed to have found a savior: "Has the Sword Conference started?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded: "Today is the group stage. We need to compete with the other 199 sword spirits in the king group. Break through the siege and become the first in the group."</p>

    <p>"Let's go!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong called out Aohai. He held the spiritual sword tightly in his hand. His expression was solemn.</p>

    <p>This time, Jiu You chose a relatively empty place for the group stage.</p>

    <p>This is an abandoned ancient sword city. It is the old sword capital of the Sword King Realm. It was the center of the imperial capital thousands of years ago.</p>

    <p>Because the location is too remote, the transportation of resources and the circulation of people are very inconvenient. The old Sword Capital was abandoned after the capital was moved and became an abandoned city.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Er Ha came to the old sword capital. The walls of the old sword capital were much shorter than those of the new sword capital. Many places had collapsed and were dilapidated.</p>

    <p>The stone city gate has long been damaged. It is just open.</p>

    <p>The outlines of the old houses can be seen inside, but the wear and tear is very serious. Because after the old swords became deserted cities, they became a place for many sword spirits to have fights and became a pure natural training ground.</p>

    <p>Just today. Because of the Sword Conference.</p>

    <p>This ancient sword city from the old era has finally regained some of its former vitality.</p>

    <p>The city was buzzing with people. It was very lively. The sword spirits participating in the competition and the sword spirits watching the melee all came.</p>

    <p>"It feels so awesome. I didn't expect the scale this time to be so big!" In front of the ancient city. Sun Rong couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>The girl didn't know all this. It was all organized by Jiu You and the sword spirits under his command. Yu Ling, Mo Yu, Xiao Qian, Carter and others worked together and mobilized countless sword spirits to protect the city. It took a lot of time. Great idea!</p>

    <p>Due to the short time, there was no time to build a new decisive battle site.</p>

    <p>Jiu You originally wanted to build a new arena similar to the Number 1 Budokan in the world.</p>

    <p>But due to time constraints, we could only requisition all the old swords.</p>

    <p>There is a ready-made sword fighting arena in the old sword capital. Although it is very dilapidated, it can still be used after temporary repairs. It is also very grand. It is the size of eight stadiums with 100,000 people.</p>

    <p>All participating sword spirits were temporarily arranged to wait in the Sword King Pavilion next to the sword fighting arena.</p>

    <p>This is the largest inn in the old Jiandu era.</p>

    <p>Now it is being reused after simple repairs.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong checked his spirit sword with a sword guard at the door. The sword guard's expression changed: "It turns out to be Miss Sun!"</p>

    <p>The sword guard solemnly stood with his feet together. He saluted Sun Rong. Then he sent a competition card to Sun Rong: "Miss Sun, please go to the Tianzi Number 1 room on the top floor."</p>

    <p>"Thank you!" The girl took the entry card with both hands. She felt a little nervous.</p>

    <p>She still has too little experience participating in a competition of this scale. And the sword spirits in the king group... are these all masters?</p>

    <p>Can she really win?</p>

    <p>Walking up the steps. Sun Rong heard many sword spirits talking about themselves.</p>

    <p>"Ah! It's that human girl. I remember her last name is Sun... She will compete with her sword spirit!"</p>

    <p>"So that Aohai is hers? She is the favorite to win the championship!"</p>

    <p>This was the discussion of other contestants. When she first heard it, the girl felt a little embarrassed. She smiled modestly.</p>

    <p>He walked quickly to his rest room. Sun Rong could still hear his heartbeat when he sat down.</p>

    <p>"Very nervous?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"A bit." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing to be nervous about. Miss Sun can just perform normally."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wu Jin and Lao Man came over from their lounge to pay their respects.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming was also among them.</p>

    <p>The two men were holding Leng Ming's little hand, one on the left and the other on the right. They walked from a distance and looked like a family of three. Sun Ying'er was shocked when he saw it: "Damn it! We haven't seen each other for a few days. What are you two doing? It's all there!"</p>

    <p>Lao Man, Wu Jin: "?"</p>

    <p>Leng Ming: "???"</p>
