  <h1>Chapter 1811 Wang Ling over there. A little exciting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This morning, Lawen sent a group message to Maiko Assi, Pei Luoqi, Levi and others in the WeChat group. She was going to briefly explain the arrangements for today. As a result, the two people seemed to have disappeared. They did not reply to her a word.</p>

    <p>But the plan still has to go on. The lack of a reply does not mean that Lawen will terminate the subsequent plans. Every link she set up for this variety show challenge is full of tests of human nature. She wants to challenge the people of Number 60 High School. More importantly, the ugliness of the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group should be made public.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what happened to Maiko Assi, Pei Luoqi, and Levi. But early in the morning, another representative of the Heavenly Dao League. The second team member Jiu Jiuyun who played the role of a primary school student in this variety show challenge plan. Appeared in front of Mrs. Lawen on time, followed by a group of white warriors.</p>

    <p>Jiuyun's height is not very high. It is said that his body has stagnated due to practicing special skills. He looks like a child, but is actually an old monster.</p>

    <p>When he stood up, he was about the same height as Wang Muyu. He was wearing a black one-piece overalls. He had long pale golden hair and earrings on his ears. He had bright eyes. From a distance, he looked like a little girl.</p>

    <p>"Lord Jiuyun, I have been waiting for you for a long time." Mrs. Lawen stood up and shook hands warmly.</p>

    <p>Jiuyun glanced at Mrs. Lawen's hand without interest. In the end, he only extended an index finger and touched her symbolically. It was quite personal.</p>

    <p>"Operation. When will it start?" Jiuyun didn't say much and asked directly.</p>

    <p>"Soon. Lord Jiuyun. But before that, your image needs to be changed. To be honest, it's too unchildlike."</p>

    <p>Lawen smiled and said: "This time Master Jiuyun plays the role of a primary school student, so the overall temperament should be more in line with a primary school student. I have prepared props and uniforms for Master Jiuyun. I hope Master Jiuyun will take off the accessories on his body. Also cover your tattoos. Hair..."</p>

    <p>"You must not touch my hair." Jiuyun glanced at Lawen and said firmly.</p>

    <p>"Okay... don't touch your hair."</p>

    <p>Lawen had no choice but to agree: "Master Jiuyun, do you have any other instructions?"</p>

    <p>Jiuyun lowered his head and thought for a moment. Then he raised his head and looked at Lawen: "If I didn't control myself during the challenge and made a fatal move, you would handle it later, right?"</p>

    <p>"Of course..." Lawen nodded: "But I hope Master Jiuyun can control himself as much as possible. You can injure people, but don't beat them to death."</p>

    <p>"I can only do my best." Jiuyun said: "I am pretending to be a primary school student, but I am not a real primary school student. The kid over at Number 60 High School is a serious primary school student. What I hate most is the naughty kid. If this naughty kid attacks me then, I think I really won't be able to bear it."</p>

    <p>Before coming here, Jiuyun had actually gone through the information of everyone at Number 60 High School. They were just a few students from the Foundation Building period. It didn't seem like there was anything noteworthy about them.</p>

    <p>Especially taking a child who is only six years old to participate in the competition. In Jiuyun's view, Wang Muyu is simply a burden to everyone at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>In the entire information, except for Miss Sun, there is nothing to pay attention to... Jiuyun doesn't know why there are so many masters in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This was the first time Wang Ling participated in the recording of a variety show. Early that morning, under the arrangement of Bad Navigation, their group successfully arrived at the agreed filming location. This is the large sports center in Glio City. It will only be used when large-scale national-level sports events are held. Originally, it was often requisitioned by the local Cultivation Army in Glio City as a military demonstration training center.</p>

    <p>But now Lawen can actually expropriate this vast piece of land as a recording location for variety shows. She even transforms the internal environment. This has to make people marvel at Lawen's strength and means.</p>

    <p>This large sports center was built in a deserted suburb of Glio City. It used to be a thousand-foot mountain. The entire stadium was built on the mountain. The mountain inside was hollowed out to make room.</p>

    <p>The key is that the external mountain structure has been preserved as a whole through technical excavation. The spiritual veins beneath the mountain have not been damaged. There is no need to even draw the spirit gathering array. This is a good place for natural practice and retreat.</p>

    <p>For the recording of this variety show, Lawen spent huge sums of money to once again transform the internal structure of the sports center.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling's group of people arrived, they could see many program staff and people gathered together. The photography team was remotely testing whether the camera balls they were using were functioning properly. The formation was huge. Wang Ling feels slightly uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Although you can wear a mask during the entire recording of this variety show without showing your face, in the face of such a large number of people, Wang Ling still feels like a subtle onset of social phobia.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if there were other people like him. Whenever he met a lot of people, his mind would start to feel empty involuntarily. He didn't know what to do next or what to say. There was a kind of separation from the world. Feeling out of place.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this process did not last long. After entering the studio, Wang Ling's symptoms were relieved a lot.</p>

    <p>The staff were mainly concentrated in the temporary shed built outside. After entering the renovated studio, there were not so many people who participated in the recording. They were surrounded by photography balls flying around. Recording their situation inside from 360 degrees without any blind spots.</p>

    <p>He waited there for less than a few minutes. From another entrance, Wang Ling saw the opponent against Number 60 High School come in.</p>

    <p>The same six people, led by a primary school student who was about the same height as Wang Muyu, entered the studio directly. Everyone wore turbine-shaped masks on their faces.</p>

    <p>"Are these the six prodigies of Glio City?" Under the mask with the logo of Number 60 High School, Chen Chao looked slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>"Uzumaki Imperial High School. This is the number one university in Glio City. All the six prodigies this time are from here." As an old intelligence expert, Guo Hao has already obtained information about these six prodigies: "They are first-year high school students like us. But they have all entered the Golden Core in advance."</p>

    <p>"They are all Golden Core? This is so unfair..."</p>

    <p>"It's just about being superior in terms of level. There are almost no substantive battles in the preparation part of the show. It should be more of a test of teamwork," Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>In fact, he himself didn't have much confidence.</p>

    <p>After both parties shook hands.</p>

    <p>Everyone was hooded by the staff. The school was divided into two different zones, black and white.</p>

    <p>The two sections, black and white, each have three secret rooms.</p>

    <p>According to the previous team distribution, everyone was arranged into the secret room in pairs.</p>

    <p>From a bird's eye view in the void, the place where everyone stands is a Tai Chi disk.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu and Jiuyun were separately taken to two special cages in the middle of the Tai Chi plate, which were located in the "yin within yang" and "yang within yin" positions.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, it's a little more exciting.</p>

    <p>When he clearly heard the sound of the thick stone door of the secret room being closed, the only sound left in the room was his and Sun Rong's breathing, which was submerged in the darkness...</p>

    <p>In a quiet environment, even the sound of breathing is particularly obvious.</p>

    <p>It's really too clear.</p>

    <p>Even her heartbeat. Wang Ling can count it clearly.</p>
