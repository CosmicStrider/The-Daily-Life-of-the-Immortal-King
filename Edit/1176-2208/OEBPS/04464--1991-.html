  <h1>Chapter 1991 Clean and hygienic</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Surrounded by a group of people. What is it like to rush to be a master...</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling has no such experience. He himself was only begged by Zhuo Yi to become a master.</p>

    <p>Of course. For a senior patient with social phobia like Wang Ling, it is not difficult for him to imagine how uncomfortable it feels to be surrounded by others and stared at.</p>

    <p>Especially when he was stared at by four powerful men at once. Even if he didn't release any spiritual pressure, just the suffocation caused by the secret competition between the powerful men with their eyes and momentum was enough to make him breathless.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is indeed expected that Li Changzhe, who is usually chatty, cannot use his mobile phone at all at the moment. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Originally, for a boy, the full keyboard grid on the mobile phone is already small enough. There is always a chance of pressing the wrong button by mistake...</p>

    <p>And under this situation, Li Changzhe had to face the attack of four powerful men. He was so weak that he hesitated in the middle.</p>

    <p>This kind of scene Wang Ling can be imagined even if you haven't seen it.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that this socially awkward person would actually end up like this...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid my fingers are shaking even when I'm typing now, right?</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the private room of the hotel restaurant, Li Changzhe was caught in the middle, staring at a table full of hotel dishes, without any appetite in his heart.</p>

    <p>These dishes were all ordered by the four seniors in front of me. Even Li Changzhe didn't know why the situation turned out like this...</p>

    <p>It wasn't long before he met Luo Lan under the recommendation of Zhuo Yi in the morning.</p>

    <p>The remaining three people came to the door...</p>

    <p>And he didn't care about the fact that he was already Luo Lan's disciple. He just wanted to rob someone in front of Luo Lan.</p>

    <p>"Haha. Master Luo Lan, you put such a big mist formation in Songhai City, but you don't care about your disciples at all. Look at what I ordered? Ultimate Dragon and Tiger Femoral Soup! This is specially formulated for clearing the lungs. Dishes! My disciple is extremely talented. He must keep up with his daily nutritional supplements!"</p>

    <p>A man with a muscular body spoke. He was huge, like a giant bear, with muscles all over his body. He just sat there, like a hill. His head almost reached the ceiling. It gave people a strong sense of oppression. feel.</p>

    <p>"Master Canglong's words are wrong... What a cultivator should practice is the heart. As long as the state of mind is deep enough, how can these things that satisfy the appetite and appetite seduce my disciple?"</p>

    <p>Luo Lan responded with a smile. Then he looked at the waitress on the side and shouted suddenly: "Waiter! Add more dishes! Bring up the most expensive Galaxy Buddha Jumping Over the Wall in your store!"</p>

    <p>"It's meaningless for you two to compete like this. We are all here to take on apprentices. Why are you so at odds with each other?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, the third person spoke. He was a middle-aged man with a slowly growing beard and an energetic face. He was wearing a Tang suit. When he smiled, the dimples on his face were deeply sunken: "Since you are like this Don't blame me for being rude... The waiter... immediately asked the chef to stew my freshly caught star dragon fish! The whole fish was stewed! You can eat as much as you want today, my disciple! Freshly caught Clean and hygienic!"</p>

    <p>The senior fisherman's name is Liu Yong. As his name suggests, he has always been brave.</p>

    <p>As a video blogger who travels around the world and tries out all kinds of weird food, Liu Yong earns money through the popularity of his videos on the Internet while practicing Buddhism. He became famous many years ago.</p>

    <p>At the same time, every time after tasting the weird food, the must-have phrase "clean and hygienic" really leaves a very deep impression on people.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was stunned. He didn't expect that these senior "masters" would be entangled like this...</p>

    <p>The damn desire to win and lose among men was fully demonstrated at this moment.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, there was still one person who had not spoken. That was a short old man sitting on the edge, as if it had nothing to do with him. He was wearing a training uniform and a red belt.</p>

    <p>Yes that's right...</p>

    <p>This one is no one else.</p>

    <p>It is none other than Yi Jianchuan himself, one of the legendary ten generals!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe never expected that even the Sword Master would be alarmed by this wave...</p>

    <p>Just when the three of them were fighting over Li Changzhe, Sword Master Yi smiled calmly: "You have finally come to Songhai City. How can I let you spend so much money? I think today's meal, I might as well let the old man Just pay the bill."</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this last statement truly defeated the three people in front of me.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere in front of his eyes gradually solidified. Li Changzhe finally couldn't help it anymore: "Seniors, I think... everyone should calm down... and I am already a disciple of Master Luo Lan. I will worship the master again." Isn't it not good..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Luo Lan nodded with satisfaction. Li Changzhe's firm attitude was really touching...</p>

    <p>"You who have become a disciple can immediately become a master. I have heard of your Mist Technique. You have already practiced to the highest level. It stands to reason that you can become a disciple a long time ago! Why does Master Luo Lan tie you up? Well. Young man...you should go see the wider world and absorb new knowledge." The burly Canglong Master said with a serious look on his face.</p>

    <p>These words were undoubtedly like a knife stabbing directly into Luo Lan's heart...</p>

    <p>And instantly rendered him speechless.</p>

    <p>Because what Cang Long said is absolutely right. Li Changzhe has mastered the art of fog to this level. It can be said that he is already better than his master himself. He has indeed reached the point where he can become a master...</p>

    <p>But the problem is. He actually only confirmed the master-disciple relationship with Li Changzhe in the morning!</p>

    <p>How can there be a land where you can leave the army at the speed of light in less than 24 days?</p>

    <p>Luo Lan was almost roaring in her heart.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of pain like a mute eating coptis...</p>

    <p>There was an agreement between him and Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Luo Lan knew very well. Without them saying anything, no one present knew that Li Changzhe's ability to practice the Mist Technique to the highest level was entirely due to him.</p>

    <p>This cheap master who came all the way to Songhai City just picked up a ready-made leak.</p>

    <p>Luo Lan originally thought that he had made a profit. He could find an opportunity to hold a big banquet in the future and show off to everyone that Li Changzhe was his direct disciple!</p>

    <p>But I never expected that not long after becoming a disciple, I would be forced to become a disciple by three other people...</p>

    <p>"It's hard to bear..."</p>

    <p>Even Li Changzhe himself felt extremely helpless. Facing these famous seniors in the world of cultivation, he found that his usual glib personality was instantly suppressed. He had no idea what to say.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that none of these individuals he dares to offend...if he really says the wrong thing, who knows if he will take revenge on him in the future?</p>

    <p>Although Li Changzhe is usually a bit open-minded, he is not completely unreasonable at critical moments. If he chatted with the few people present in his usual casual tone, he felt that he might be beaten to death directly.</p>

    <p>OMG!</p>

    <p>Can anyone come and save me quickly...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe cried out in despair.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a figure wearing Li Changzhe's familiar school uniform suddenly appeared at the door of the private room.</p>

    <p>Although the figure just passed by in a flash, Li Changzhe quickly recognized this person.</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ling!</p>
