  <h1>Chapter 1573 You didn't penetrate the baby girl's armor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Naturally powerful?</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was even more happy. He didn't expect that this little girl could actually tear his arm off. And it seemed like it didn't take much effort.</p>

    <p>So looking at this scene, the thought in Fenmu Shen's heart was not fear.</p>

    <p>But he became even more determined. He wanted to take this little girl as his apprentice or wife.</p>

    <p>It seems good if she can be captured as a child bride!</p>

    <p>But there was only one thing Fenmu Shen didn't understand.</p>

    <p>Why does this newborn girl have such great power?</p>

    <p>But regarding this issue, Fenmu Shen feels there is no need to worry.</p>

    <p>As long as this girl can be taken down and brought back, there will be plenty of time for her to conduct human research.</p>

    <p>Maybe as long as this secret is cracked, maybe we can know why the kid named Wang Ling on Earth is so powerful...</p>

    <p>"Girl. It's a pity. You are still young. You are not destined to be my opponent."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen raised the corners of her mouth slightly. Her purple eyes looked at Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>The arm that was torn off by Wang Nuan earlier grew back from the fracture with some kind of purple sour-smelling mucus due to countless cell divisions at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Physical damage is already negligible to Fenmu Shen at this stage.</p>

    <p>Even if the head is decapitated and the whole body is turned into a ball of flesh, a new head can be quickly grown.</p>

    <p>As for the physical pain. After reaching the Heavenly Ancestor state, the state of unity between man and nature made him unable to feel the existence of pain.</p>

    <p>All physical pain will be transformed into heavenly pain!</p>

    <p>It was just like Wang Nuan tore his arm off just now. The moment the arm was torn off, a meteor slipped down in the universe at the same time.</p>

    <p>And this is the pain of heaven.</p>

    <p>"I must take you away today." At this time, he looked at Wang Nuan confidently and pointed out his claws accurately toward a certain coordinate position on the earth.</p>

    <p>He could see that the baby girl in front of him was just the materialization of a shadow.</p>

    <p>There is no point in taking away this shadow. The most important thing is the original body.</p>

    <p>But now, his grasp is aimed at the main body!</p>

    <p>When those hands covered it, the earth was instantly shrouded in a large shadow, covering the sky and the sun!</p>

    <p>However, the infinitely enlarged palm print was resisted by a huge force before it approached the earth.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen frowned and increased the strength on his hands. However, he was shocked to find that no matter how much force he exerted, the brute force against him would also increase at the same time.</p>

    <p>Soon, he realized the mystery of this matter.</p>

    <p>"Is it a shadow?"</p>

    <p>Immediately, Fenmu Shen couldn't help but reveal a look of surprise in her eyes.</p>

    <p>After he withdrew his hand, the brute force that resisted him disappeared immediately.</p>

    <p>This further confirms Fenmu Shen's suspicion.</p>

    <p>"Girl, your shadow ability seems to be stronger than I imagined. You can actually control my shadow?" Fenmu Shen was amazed at Wang Nuan's ability.</p>

    <p>He has never seen such skill before</p>

    <p>He originally thought that Wang Nuan's shadow ability was very limited. But he didn't expect that the other party could not only use this ability on himself, but also control other people's shadows!</p>

    <p>"Even if I beat you to half a disability today, I will take you back."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen's eyes completely dimmed.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan's appearance made him feel extremely excited.</p>

    <p>The shadow is connected to the main body. If the shadow is injured, the main body will also be damaged to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the integrity of the little girl, Fenmu Shen previously planned to attack Wang Nuan's body directly. But now it seems that he must first clear away the shadow of the little girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he will encounter obstacles even when he invades the earth.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>At this time, the materialized shadow differentiated by Wang Nuan suddenly released endless black light. It spread to all directions! It formed a vortex and swallowed up everything nearby!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen looked at this scene and did not resist. He was fighting with the mentality of teasing a child.</p>

    <p>He thinks he is invincible and will not take any ability shown in a baby girl seriously, because this is just a child. Even if the ability and special ability are not real, it is useless.</p>

    <p>"Interesting. You actually used your own shadow to build a space. Have you stripped away the real world?" Fenmu Shen felt the changes in the surrounding environment. He couldn't help but laugh again.</p>

    <p>Everything has a shadow. Even this huge universe is no exception.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent Fenmu Shen from causing damage to the earth, Wang Nuan took this step and copied the entire solar system to form a shadow space.</p>

    <p>All battles that take place here will not affect the real world.</p>

    <p>It is the same as the previous battle between Wang Ling and Zheng in this world.</p>

    <p>"In that case, I have no choice but to suppress you first..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen made a move. He waved his sleeves and heard a loud bang. It was astonishing as the earth was shattering.</p>

    <p>The universe in front of us cracked open and countless storms rolled up.</p>

    <p>He tried to break through Wang Nuan's shadow space.</p>

    <p>But Fenmu Shen missed one point.</p>

    <p>That is the shadow space. Although the effect is similar to the "inside world", it is completely different from the "inside world."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan takes charge of Shadow!</p>

    <p>All shadows will obey Wang Nuan's command.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen didn't know what consequences his momentary negligence would have.</p>

    <p>Now. He is in this shadow space.</p>

    <p>What exactly are we facing...</p>

    <p>In one thought!</p>

    <p>The storm that was rolling wildly in the shadow space was restored to tranquility with a thought from Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Even a wisp of wind has a shadow.</p>

    <p>As long as it's in this shadow space.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan is the only true god!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen considers himself invincible. He can control the wind and rain with just a single gesture. But no matter how he moves his sleeves, there will never be any ripples in this shadow space.</p>

    <p>The scene at this moment is very similar to those ancient costume immortal dramas after losing the special effects. The actors and actresses are performing various awkward postures and movements...</p>

    <p>"What on earth is this?" Fenmu Shen frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>The calm smile that had always been on his face was finally completely broken at this moment.</p>

    <p>A drop of cold sweat slid down his forehead and cheeks.</p>

    <p>He had never seen this situation before. But he did not feel that he had lost.</p>

    <p>After all, he still has the magic weapon obtained from the sky tomb!</p>

    <p>Each piece is a collection of Dao Ancestor Wang! The supreme chaos device!</p>

    <p>"Girl. Now that things have happened...don't blame me for being ruthless."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the light in Fenmu Shen's hand changed. A revolver with a simple style appeared in his palm.</p>

    <p>This is a chaos device called "Big Era."</p>

    <p>One bullet is powerful enough to penetrate the distance of ten galaxies! And it cannot be stopped!</p>

    <p>Everything that stands in front of this bullet will be mercilessly penetrated. Then it will be "soaked" by the power of chaos and then explode!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen can see that this shadow space is very strange.</p>

    <p>If he had known earlier, he should have been more careful.</p>

    <p>And it seems a little late to say this now...</p>

    <p>But it's not that easy to trap him.</p>

    <p>"Haha. Little guy, you didn't expect it, did you? There is such modern equipment in this eternal chaos device..."</p>

    <p>No extra thinking.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen pulled her own trigger.</p>

    <p>Facing the speeding silver bullet, Wang Nuan closed his eyelids subconsciously. It was not because he was afraid of the bullet. It was just that he was a little confused by the dazzling light refracted by the bullet.</p>

    <p>This silver bullet successfully hit Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl just felt like her eyelids were bitten by mosquitoes.</p>

    <p>The silver bullet bounced off the little girl's eyelids. It did not penetrate Wang Nuan's armor.</p>

    <p>The moment the bullet was deflected, Ah Nuan girl finally showed a smile. It was an expression as if she had discovered a new toy.</p>

    <p>She looked at the chaos device called "Big Era" in Fenmu Shen's hand. Then she stretched out her little hand. She divided the shadows and created an identical one.</p>

    <p>It's just that the shadow replica in the hands of Ah Nuan girl is pure black.</p>

    <p>After all, the little girl is just a newborn child...</p>

    <p>He has great curiosity about everything and has a strong learning ability.</p>

    <p>She played with the "Big Era" revolver in her hand. Then she imitated Fenmu Shen's previous appearance. In turn, she fired a bullet at Fenmu Shen!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was shocked.</p>

    <p>He would never have thought that even the Chaos Magical Artifact and the girl in front of him could be recreated with shadows!</p>

    <p>This shot was about to hit Fenmu Shen's head. Fenmu Shen caught it firmly with two fingers.</p>

    <p>It's just a bullet.</p>

    <p>It would be a bit embarrassing if I couldn't handle this.</p>

    <p>The bullet missed Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan, who was holding a pistol, looked a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>So. The little girl took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Just the next second.</p>

    <p>This shadow revolver.</p>

    <p>Changed again in the hands of Ah Nuan girl...</p>

    <p>This "Big Time" revolver originally only had six rounds of ammunition!</p>

    <p>It turned into a Gatling!</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Does this shadow replica come with upgrades?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen looked at the scene in front of him in disbelief.</p>

    <p>Chug tug tug tug...</p>

    <p>The next second, the little girl had already controlled the upgrade in her hand and fired wildly at Fenmu Shen.</p>
