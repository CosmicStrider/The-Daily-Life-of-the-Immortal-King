  <h1>Chapter 1767 World 0 Food Tickets</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under the high-priced real estate industry chain spurred by the capitalist economy of modern cultivating society, almost all cultivators have become house slaves tied to huge mortgage loans.</p>

    <p>Although there is space expansion technology that can make the usable area of a house wider, this technology is not affordable for everyone.</p>

    <p>The wool comes from the sheep. In the end, the people who benefit the most will always be the top group of cultivators.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when the option of redeeming video game points for real estate came out, Wang Ling could instantly feel the envy and jealousy in the eyes of the people around him.</p>

    <p>I have no interest in real estate. Wang Ling. No matter how big the house is, if the spiritual culture is not rich, it will only bring endless emptiness that cannot be filled.</p>

    <p>So when faced with this option, he chose to skip it directly. And finally set his sights on a special snack voucher worth 10 million points.</p>

    <p>He has 100 million points. Just enough to redeem ten of them.</p>

    <p>"World Snack Coupon." After seeing Wang Ling choose to redeem this option, the people around felt their hearts bleeding. He didn't want a house. He actually went to exchange for snacks... This Aqian master. Is he a loser, or a naughty kid?</p>

    <p>But then again, under normal circumstances, the thinking of great gods is inherently strange. It is not something that normal people can consider.</p>

    <p>After seeing the choice of Wang Ling, the people around them all showed disappointed expressions and then dispersed.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Muyu looked at Wang Ling with admiring eyes.</p>

    <p>"Boss, how do we use this coupon?"</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling took out the World Snack Coupon, Wang Muyu smiled at the arcade. He was innocent and cute.</p>

    <p>The manager bent down and explained patiently: "It's like this. Ganshen. And Ganshen's younger brother... It's more troublesome to use snack coupons. I wonder if you have seen the national flag on the snack coupons. Every national flag, they all correspond to a country. The World Snack Coupon is equivalent to a VIP card for snacks."</p>

    <p>"As long as you go to that country with a snack coupon that corresponds to the national flag, you can use the coupon to exchange it for 100,000 yuan worth of snacks at any hypermarket, as many times as you like, while the quota lasts."</p>

    <p>"It's just that it's very troublesome to use... you have to go there and redeem it yourself. Although you have the World Snack Coupon and the matching round-trip air ticket service, it's troublesome to go abroad now. You have to go through various procedures to prove yourself."</p>

    <p>When the manager said this, he looked at Wang Ling mysteriously and said, "So I suggest. Qianshen, should you consider pretending that nothing happened... I'll return the points to you. Can you choose again?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Obviously. This manager is also from Boss Sun's side...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the Yushiji snack coupon in his hand. Finally he shook his head.</p>

    <p>As for round-trip air tickets and so on.</p>

    <p>He doesn't need it.</p>

    <p>Because he can teleport.</p>

    <p>"Brother. Do we really want to go?"</p>

    <p>After taking away the World Snack Coupon, Wang Muyu's expression became even more excited, because not only did he come out this time, but he was also able to travel abroad with Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>This is simply a travel adventure!</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Muyu's excited expression, Wang Ling nodded helplessly. Anyway, he just went to redeem snacks. He will be back soon.</p>

    <p>Soon he drew his first World Snack Coupon and chose his first stop - Mixiu Country Glio City.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the bathroom stall, after confirming that no one was around, Wang Ling put his hand on Wang Muyu's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Dad, it's okay. It's teleportation. I can keep up." Wang Muyu said via voice transmission with an innocent smile.</p>

    <p>Don't tell me. Wang Ling almost forgot that Wang Muyu is a capable little dragon man.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that taking Wang Muyu out to play would be very difficult.</p>

    <p>It turned out that the little guy was more obedient than he thought. He was so sensible that no one could find any excuse to dislike him.</p>

    <p>So in the end. Wang Ling released his hand on Wang Muyu's shoulder.</p>

    <p>He knows.</p>

    <p>The little guy wants to express himself in front of him.</p>

    <p>You have to give the little guy a chance to express himself...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile on the other side.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang, who was hiding in the single room next door, still had an unstoppable desire to gossip. She knew that Wang Ling's next move would definitely be to go abroad to exchange snacks. For a moment, she was a little hesitant about whether she should follow him or not.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. Does Your Highness Ghost Ax Spirit Mother still want to follow?" Lord Ma asked in a low voice.</p>

    <p>"Go home..." Mother Wang frowned.</p>

    <p>Because she had already taken photos of Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>But it's not Wang Muyu's original appearance. It's the appearance after deliberately gaining weight.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang felt that he looked vaguely familiar. But she couldn't tell what it was about him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mixiu Country Glio Municipality.</p>

    <p>When Wang Muyu teleported over, there was a bustling street filled with blond hair and blue eyed people everywhere.</p>

    <p>He found that Wang Ling was not beside him. But his breath was very close.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Muyu feel a little disappointed. He thought he could keep up with Wang Ling more accurately so that Wang Ling could praise himself. Unexpectedly, he erred at this critical moment.</p>

    <p>In fact, regarding the teleportation of coordinates, there will indeed be some deviations when using the space movement ability for the first few times. This is also normal.</p>

    <p>Take Wang Ling as an example. He has teleported several times since he was a child.</p>

    <p>The little guy has been following Mr. Boss Sun these past few days. He is picked up and dropped off by his own car everywhere and rarely uses his spatial teleportation ability. It is normal for him not to be familiar with it.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling landed, he found that Wang Muyu was not around. He immediately thought of it.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the distance is actually not too far. As long as you follow the breath, you will meet each other soon.</p>

    <p>In a dark alley, Wang Ling put his hands in his pockets and accurately tracked Wang Muyu's breath. He was about to follow him. But he suddenly found that Wang Muyu started to move towards the opposite position from him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned for a moment.</p>

    <p>He found that someone seemed to be chasing Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As soon as he landed on the ground, Wang Muyu felt that someone was staring at him. That kind of ill-intentioned malice made Wang Muyu's sensitive nerve perception ability infinitely amplified at this moment.</p>

    <p>In order to avoid being discovered by suddenly teleporting into the crowd, Wang Muyu also deliberately used his invisibility ability as a protection. He waited until he reached a hidden location before unlocking the invisibility spell.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that as soon as he was about to meet Wang Ling, an inexplicable person would stare at him.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu gritted his teeth. This was the first time he had faced such a challenge alone.</p>

    <p>He just failed to teleport. He needs another chance to show himself in front of Wang Ling. Then he gets praise from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So, the little guy's blood boiled at this moment. I don't know whether it was nervousness or anticipation.</p>

    <p>The streets in foreign countries are completely different from those in Huaxiu. Roads and bungalows paved with white tiles outline criss-crossing alleys.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu dove in from the side of the street without hesitation. And the villain who was following him quickly caught up with him.</p>

    <p>This man's fighting ability is mediocre. Of course Wang Muyu is not afraid. But doing it openly on the street will cause a commotion. So Wang Muyu's move is to find a secluded place to lure people in and then kill them...</p>
