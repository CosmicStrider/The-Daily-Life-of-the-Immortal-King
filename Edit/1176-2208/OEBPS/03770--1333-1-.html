  <h1>Chapter 1333 Office of Strategic Deception failed miserably?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Deep to the west of the Milky Way outside the territory. Here stars and rocks surge and space collapses.</p>

    <p>There is a fierce battle between two shadows going on here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's palm was extremely powerful. It slammed the split Sun Ying'er into the nearest planet!</p>

    <p>The girl's figure transformed into a shooting star the moment she was slapped away. It suddenly pierced through the core of the planet.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The planet exploded and disappeared into the universe along with the girl's figure.</p>

    <p>"It's really difficult..." Wang Ying retracted her palm.</p>

    <p>This is the eighth time he has killed the split body.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er's ability to replicate and split was beyond Wang Ying's imagination.</p>

    <p>Kill a Sun Ying'er. Immediately another Sun Ying'er will split off and continue fighting with him.</p>

    <p>"Give up. Wang Ying." The girl's laughter echoed in the space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying saw a black curse mark across the girl's tall nose. It extended from the face to the girl's body.</p>

    <p>This is Sun Ying'er's "Seal of Split." Whenever the girl dies, the Seal of Split will be activated automatically, splitting into a brand new Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>"I know. Wang Ling is very powerful. But he is in the unspeakable place now."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said, with a confident expression on his face: "It's easy to get in, but it's hard to get out."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying remained silent.</p>

    <p>He determined in his heart that Sun Ying'er must not know that Wang Ling has modified the ban on the Unspeakable Land...</p>

    <p>If it is Dao Ancestor Wang's ban. Of course it will not be easy for Wang Ling to come out.</p>

    <p>But now. This restriction has been overridden by Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>In other words.</p>

    <p>Now this unspeakable place has long since changed hands.</p>

    <p>Directly overriding Dao Ancestor Wang's restriction. Such an unbelievable operation. Of course it is impossible to imagine it with normal brain circuits.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after Wang Ying listened, he even felt a little ridiculous.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is too confident.</p>

    <p>I was fooled without knowing it...</p>

    <p>This is the greatest sadness.</p>

    <p>At this time, the split body Sun Ying'er was still in front of him. He said eloquently: "Now, your master is trapped in an unspeakable place. Everyone is delayed by my split body. They are just waiting for my final blow. The earth will It will disintegrate in an instant. The Office of Strategic Deception has been completely defeated... I don't know. What's the point of you continuing to fight?"</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, the personality of the shadow and the main body are really very different." Wang Ying sneered.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's inexplicable confidence made him laugh.</p>

    <p>Different from the ontology. Sun Rong's self-confidence is real self-confidence. And it is definitely not the kind of conceited self-confidence.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Sun Ying'er seems a bit excessive.</p>

    <p>Overconfidence. That is ignorant pride.</p>

    <p>Conquer this object of pride.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ying, there is actually a great sense of accomplishment.</p>

    <p>"Woman. You are playing with fire."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying looked at Sun Ying'er and took a deep breath: "You may not know that my ability is actually copying."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er of the split body laughed: "Can you split into a split body like me? Even if you can, you are not a member of the void. Where do you get so much energy for you to use?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying stops talking nonsense.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment, a scene happened that shocked the split body Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Right before his eyes, Wang Ying actually split himself into dozens of pieces!</p>

    <p>And the energy of each split body is the same as Wang Ying himself!</p>

    <p>"Don't forget my abilities. I can copy everything except my father's King's Eyes." At this moment, Wang Ying stared at Sun Ying'er and smiled.</p>

    <p>Although it took some time to replicate Sun Ying'er's splitting ability, the good news is that everything is under control.</p>

    <p>As for the energy required for the split body?</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>Not to mention him.</p>

    <p>The man who is now in the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>The energy contained in your body... is greater than the energy of ten, one hundred, or eleven million void worlds combined!</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ying knows clearly.</p>

    <p>The head of his family.</p>

    <p>A man who will never be drained!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time goes back five minutes. Crispy Noodles Dao Lord in Office of Strategic Deception is also in trouble.</p>

    <p>What he faced was Sun Ying'er's true form. This was more difficult to deal with than the split body.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has lent "Yu" to him.</p>

    <p>However, the combat power of the "real clone" is limited after all. Just withstanding the pressure of the original body has already made Crispy Noodles Dao Lord extremely difficult.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao carefully protected the girl in the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>Cooperating with {Thirty-Three Paths of Vitality}. Zhuo Yi opened all the remaining gates from the last fight against the virtual spirit. Cooperating with the death of Heavenly Dao, they jointly set up a defensive array.</p>

    <p>Securely protect Sun Rong in the golden mask.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is moved.</p>

    <p>In front of you. What you see. And what you can't see.</p>

    <p>Everyone is protecting her.</p>

    <p>But in her soul state, she could only watch and couldn't do anything.</p>

    <p>There is no way to stop the crazy Sun Ying'er from launching a fierce attack on Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>"Junior sister Sun Rong, don't think too much! Don't worry. There will be no problem!"</p>

    <p>This battle was not easy. But Zhuo Yi spoke to Sun Rong in as relaxed a tone as possible.</p>

    <p>The most taboo thing at this time is to shake your mind.</p>

    <p>The shadow is such a state of mind...</p>

    <p>Once the girl loses her mind, Sun Ying'er will definitely take advantage of it!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's words seemed to wake the girl up. Sun Rong's pupils shook: "Senior Zhuo, I will withstand it!"</p>

    <p>She came to her senses.</p>

    <p>Everyone in front of her is fighting for her...</p>

    <p>Then she shouldn't give up easily.</p>

    <p>We shouldn't even have the thought that it would be better to follow Sun Ying'er and return to the void.</p>

    <p>The pure white snow lotus petals fell rapidly in the air. These gentle petals moved at high speed and turned into deadly sharp objects.</p>

    <p>As it passes through the void, it splits the air.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord holds "Yu" in hand to resist.</p>

    <p>He will plunge into the earth.</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>A dense 100-foot-long crystal bamboo forest instantly rose up from the ground. These crystal bamboos have super hardness and form a thick defensive barrier.</p>

    <p>However, the power of the snow lotus petals is unparalleled. They rush forward in groups.</p>

    <p>Countless bamboos were cut away in an instant. They were chopped into bamboo joints. Finally, they turned into particles of light and disappeared.</p>

    <p>These light particles fall on the ground. Finally, new crystal bamboo grows again.</p>

    <p>"The power of the Son of the Void is too strong." Zhuo Yi marveled inwardly.</p>

    <p>The complete Son of the Void is too powerful.</p>

    <p>And this doesn't seem to be the full strength of Sun Ying'er. The other party is absorbing the energy transmitted by the Lord of the Void...</p>

    <p>The overall combat power will increase as time goes by!</p>

    <p>"The second sword in the world is too weak." Death Heavenly Dao complained at the side.</p>

    <p>"Senior, please stop being venomous. It's not because you are weak... but because you were stimulated last time. You haven't recovered yet."</p>

    <p>"Stimulate?"</p>

    <p>"It's not because Lord Jingbai! It took so long to wait and finally chose Fan Rui as his master. In the end, Fan Rui took him directly to find the only man he couldn't beat."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"That's not all! The man also found his own scabbard..."</p>

    <p>"I understand!" Death Heavenly Dao suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this is a single dog who was hit hard...</p>

    <p>No wonder the performance languishes.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason. If "Yu" were a little more serious.</p>

    <p>Even if Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is weak in battle, with the blessing of "Yu", he won't be beaten!</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>At this time, a piece of pure white petals passed through the dense bamboo forest and accurately hit Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's right eye.</p>

    <p>The blood flowed down instantly. Crispy Noodles Dao Lord pressed his eyes and used "Yu" to support his body.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. I said. I will definitely take you away." Sun Ying'er smiled easily.</p>

    <p>She looked up at the sky and muttered something in her mouth.</p>

    <p>"Void energy...97%. 98%...100%..."</p>

    <p>It's all over!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Ying'er rises into the sky.</p>

    <p>She knew very well that the moment for her to play her last trump card had arrived...</p>

    <p>In just a moment, a huge sense of oppression descended on the entire earth!</p>

    <p>That is a huge pressure that dominates the world!</p>

    <p>Even a cultivator at the True Immortal level could not withstand the pressure. He fell to his knees, his whole body trembling uncontrollably!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er. has successfully become.</p>

    <p>Brand new.</p>

    <p>Lord of the Void!</p>
