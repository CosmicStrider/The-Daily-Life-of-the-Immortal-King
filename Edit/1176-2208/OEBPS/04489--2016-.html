  <h1>Chapter 2016 What you are facing is not someone else. But Huangquan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Deep in the extraterrestrial galaxy. Er Ha and Xiao Yin, who were fighting fiercely, looked at the direction of the earth at the same time.</p>

    <p>Since they have advanced to become mythical beasts, they have often competed against each other. Before the final battle came, Yi Gin and Yi Gou had made up their minds. They planned to each practice a unique secret skill to complete before the final battle.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has already named the secret skill {Swallowing Stars}. As the name suggests, this is a secret skill derived from the inspiration of the tengu swallowing the moon in the mythological system of the old era. However, the area of the planet that Er Ha wants to swallow is much larger than the moon. many.</p>

    <p>And now Er Ha has only barely cultivated to the level where he can swallow an entire Jupiter. This is still far away from Er Ha's ultimate goal...</p>

    <p>As for Xiao Yin, she still has no clue about her unique secret skill.</p>

    <p>He wanted to ask Wang Ling for advice. But Wang Ling was very busy these days and was too embarrassed to bother him.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Is someone looking for the master to kill someone again..." After sensing the aura of Wang Ling from a very far distance, Xiao Yin suddenly stopped and stared into the distance.</p>

    <p>"I know that man. But the Lord doesn't seem to have any intention of destroying him."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Do you want to be free-range?"</p>

    <p>"To save his life and dig out other alien invasion creatures lurking on the earth."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "Speaking of which, don't you have a clue?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "No...I don't know what kind of secret skill is better to practice."</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha lowered his head and thought for a moment. Suddenly asked: "Tell me, are there any higher-order forms above the mythical beast?"</p>

    <p>"Higher level?"</p>

    <p>This question completely confused Xiao Yin: "There shouldn't be anything stronger than the divine beast, right? Conventional divine beasts are born from chaos. Just like the prairie dog of senior Jin Deng. But we are because of the master. Just ascended."</p>

    <p>"Indeed. I also feel that I have reached my peak. But you and I are still different."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "Don't forget. I was once a demon king. The Lord helped me change my bloodline. Then I turned into a spiritual beast. Then I upgraded to a holy beast little by little, and then to the body of a divine beast now."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was confused: "So?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But you were a holy beast from the beginning. Our base is different. So I am thinking. Is there any chance for you to go further?"</p>

    <p>These words were a revelation. Xiao Yin was immediately stopped in his tracks.</p>

    <p>Theoretically speaking, his foundation is completely different from Er Ha's. He was a serious beast from the beginning.</p>

    <p>According to the basic advanced knowledge of cultivation, it seems that there is indeed the possibility of impacting higher levels.</p>

    <p>As for those mythical beasts bred from chaos, most of them are bound by the power of chaos. Their realm is relatively fixed, but there is not much room for growth.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's question is equivalent to inspiring a new idea for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Even if it's not that easy to advance.</p>

    <p>So can he develop a secret method that can transform him into a higher-level form in a short period of time?</p>

    <p>And you can freely control the switch. How can you maintain your original appearance between change and stability?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone is practicing. Each of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception is struggling hard in the Mountain of Recall. At the same time, the same goes for Xiao Yin and Er Ha, who are fighting each other in the outer galaxy.</p>

    <p>Of course, the bright moon night is also in the process of practice.</p>

    <p>Facing the Earth cultivator who suddenly appeared in front of him and couldn't see his face clearly, Ming Yueye showed a trace of confusion on his face.</p>

    <p>A drop of cold sweat rolled down his cheek.</p>

    <p>Could it be that the rumors are true?</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye knows that there are many experts in this Office of Strategic Deception, and there are many Eternals hidden in it.</p>

    <p>According to the intelligence information he has obtained so far, the master of Lord Diulei, the master of the Office of Strategic Deception, is most likely hidden in the mysterious forbidden forest of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Who is Lord Diulei?</p>

    <p>This is the most famous super-sect master of the Office of Strategic Deception on the earth today. Naturally, Mingyue Ye also tried to assassinate this legendary senior figure who sought death before coming to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>This death-seeking senior...actually has an immortal body. No matter how many times he assassinates someone or what method he uses, the opponent's body can recover on its own like a ball of intelligent clay sculpture.</p>

    <p>So. Mingyue Ye is tired and numb.</p>

    <p>He never thought that there were people on this earth that he couldn't kill...</p>

    <p>So he began to investigate the Office of Strategic Deception. And began to suspect that in this mysterious forbidden forest, the legendary true strongest cultivator on earth may be hidden!</p>

    <p>The reason why Lord Diulei can be resurrected continuously is probably because this most powerful cultivator is causing trouble behind his back.</p>

    <p>Then as long as he kills Lord Diulei's master first, maybe the situation will not be as complicated as he expected.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Mingyue Ye discovered that the real situation was far worse than he imagined...</p>

    <p>How could he not clearly see the face of the strongest cultivator on earth?</p>

    <p>On a bright moonlit night, I suppressed the horror in my heart.</p>

    <p>Even though the person in front of him had his trouser pockets inserted from beginning to end, did not say a word to him, and assumed a calm and calm attitude, Ming Yue Ye still couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>He waved his magic wand, flicking the clouds to the sun with one move, trying to see Wang Ling's face clearly.</p>

    <p>This is a spell that analyzes illusions.</p>

    <p>He suspected that he couldn't see Wang Ling's face clearly. It was because he was under an illusion.</p>

    <p>However, when Parting the Clouds and Seeing the Sun was successfully used, the face of the person in front of him did not change at all.</p>

    <p>"Damn it!"</p>

    <p>He sneered secretly. He became angry from embarrassment. The wand in his hand began to accumulate spiritual energy. Countless chaos missiles combined with the energy of chaos began to condense in the void. They began to bombard Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling estimated the explosive power of these chaos missiles. It can indeed be described as amazing. It is much more powerful than nuclear bombs.</p>

    <p>With so many chaos missiles smashed down together, the entire Songhai City will be wiped off the map. Moreover, the scattered cosmic chaos radiation will also spread to the surrounding areas.</p>

    <p>But Mingyue Ye obviously didn't expect who the opponent she was facing would be.</p>

    <p>In Mingyue Ye's understanding, no cultivator on the earth can withstand this kind of power. Not even the cultivators on earth, not even the cultivators on earth, can withstand a chaos missile! Under God, they will all be destroyed. Reduced to ashes!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows exactly what kind of damage these chaos missiles will cause once they fall.</p>

    <p>The city he lives in will be destroyed. The Office of Strategic Deception that he supported Lord Diulei to establish will also be reduced to ashes. And most importantly, the supermarket that he longs for selling limited-flavor dry noodles at special prices will also be destroyed. Gone...</p>

    <p>This is something Wang Ling cannot bear no matter what.</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Ling had no time to think about all this.</p>

    <p>He only opened five of them towards the void. The advancing chaos missiles were frozen in mid-air as if time had stopped.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the entire time and space seemed to be frozen.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye's back was so frightened that the whole thing was soaked with sweat.</p>

    <p>Just because of this moment, the sound of gurgling water rang in his ears.</p>

    <p>He can be sure that it is the sound of the underworld...</p>
