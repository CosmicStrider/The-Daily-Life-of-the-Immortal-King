  <h1>Chapter 2106 Sun Rong and her wronged grandma</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The last and most critical map of the Sun family's ancestral land, which symbolizes the grand history of the Sun family, is in the Vientiane Space. It originally contained the golden coffin where the ancestor of the Sun family was buried. The remains inside were not the ancestor of the Sun family himself.</p>

    <p>This incident caught everyone here by surprise. Wang LingAlthough it was calculated that the contents of the coffin might have been swapped, or simply empty, they failed to calculate that the remains in the coffin actually belonged to Lao Jun himself.</p>

    <p>Before, he secretly complained that the relationship between the two brothers was so good that they could wear a pair of underpants. But he never expected that the relationship could be so good that they even used the same coffin.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the opinion of Wang Ling, there is a high probability that the remains were switched. It is not that the person who buried them at the beginning was Lao Jun himself.</p>

    <p>After all, the history related to the burial of the founder of the Sun family. The Sun family has a complete family history. The above process and even the details. The direct bloodline of the Sun family in past generations can be heard from the elders.</p>

    <p>It's just... when did this package change happen?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. What he feared most was trouble. Unexpectedly, as the incident was further investigated, it became more and more troublesome...</p>

    <p>He just wants to study and take exams quietly. Just go to school!</p>

    <p>But now that it has happened, I can't remember it for a while.</p>

    <p>He had an intuition. He felt that an invisible curtain had been opened.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. What should we do now?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>Lying in the coffin was his master. Even though it was a glazed corpse, Immortal Toya still recognized it. He did not embarrass his master. He inherited the mantle of blood from the eternal master.</p>

    <p>But what should he do now... Even his thoughts are in chaos...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment. Jing Jing dropped a pair from his divine display cabinet and left them in Picture Number 49.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren is this?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"Insert eyes." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Jun's remains. Wang Ling does not plan to take them out for the time being.</p>

    <p>What he took out from the display cabinet of the gods was Pupil Number 05: The Hidden Void Eye.</p>

    <p>The appearance is golden yellow. The pupils are seven-color gear-shaped. It has strong stealth and surveillance capabilities. It can faithfully restore everything it sees. It ignores illusions.</p>

    <p>In other words, this pair is most suitable for monitoring.</p>

    <p>If necessary, he can also arrive here directly.</p>

    <p>All disguises will be ineffective in front of Pupil Number 05, and all images seen through Pupil Number 05 will also be transmitted to other pupils simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Soul planting. Someone who has such an ability must have been planning for a long time. Therefore, the remains of the ancestor of the Sun family in the coffin were packaged into the remains of Lao Jun. It must not have happened overnight.</p>

    <p>We can only stay under surveillance first. We will see the situation later. It is not appropriate to make any other big noises.</p>

    <p>I have lost my ancestors...</p>

    <p>If this incident were to be revealed, it would not only be a shock to the Sun family, but it would also undoubtedly be a huge blow to Boss Sun himself.</p>

    <p>So the best way Wang Ling currently thinks of is to hide this matter. Press it down.</p>

    <p>After all, Boss Sun treats him quite well.</p>

    <p>From the very first meeting. Wang Ling, I felt that Mr. Boss Sun was kind-hearted and very amiable.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling returned to Ice Purgatory, Zhenyuan Immortal once again restored the place to its original state.</p>

    <p>At first glance, it's obvious that he has the skills of an experienced craftsman. Wang Ling heard that Zhenyuan Immortal has quite a lot of business now. From building maps to repairing civil and military matters, he can do it all.</p>

    <p>In a sense. Wang Ling feels that Zhenyuan is also a genius.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. This map has been repaired as ordered." After seeing Wang Ling, Zhenyuan bowed quickly.</p>

    <p>Gu YanWang Ling also hurriedly released the people and animals trapped in his core world one by one.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya, Sun Ru, Xiu Fengnian sealed in the cauldron, Thunder Eater, Woodchuck...</p>

    <p>This shocked Sun Rong. She was very surprised. There were only two people when they went in. Why were there so many people and animals when they came out?</p>

    <p>And there is actually a... woman!</p>

    <p>At that moment. Sun Rong felt the sense of crisis in his heart rising again. Although he was telling himself to calm down... but he had to admit that the woman in front of him looked really elegant, mature and rich. charm.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong I didn't expect that a woman wearing armor could look very beautiful. She was heroic and handsome. It's no exaggeration to describe Sun Ru at this moment.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru. It was Sun Ying'er who deliberately did not disclose the information to Sun Rong. She was just waiting to see the good show.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Sun Rong actually took the bait!</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. This sister is..." Sun Rong cautiously probed.</p>

    <p>She kept smiling as much as possible. She even ignored the marmots and thunder beasts beside her. The theme was clear and straight to the point. She went straight to Sun Ru: "Introduce yourself to my sister. My name is Sun Rong ."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at Sun Ru. He was also thinking. To be honest, he didn't know how many generations there were between Sun Ru and Sun Rong... Anyway, calling her sister was definitely inappropriate.</p>

    <p>But because Sun Ru was sealed for a long time, even her body and appearance were stuck in that era. She actually looked very young, in her early twenties.</p>

    <p>It seems a bit strange to be called old.</p>

    <p>For a while. Wang Ling could not find the appropriate seniority word.</p>

    <p>Dad's mother is called grandma. Then grandma's mother's mother...</p>

    <p>Finally. Wang Ling chose to give up the resistance directly.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Sun Ru volunteered and said, "Oh, you are Sun Rong. You really have some demeanor of a descendant of the Sun family. It's just that your level is a little lower."</p>

    <p>This is Sun Ru's evaluation of the younger generations as the ancestral generation of the Sun family. In terms of basic level, Sun Rong's current level is definitely not outstanding compared to what it was in the past. But in modern times, it is extremely Gifted talents.</p>

    <p>After all, there has been plenty of spiritual energy for eternity...</p>

    <p>However, these words still made those present who knew Sun Rong feel ashamed.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if Sun Rong and Sun Ru fought, Sun Ru might not be able to beat Sun Rong... That is the number one Golden Core on earth with nine cores Aohai!</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong didn't know Sun Ru's origins, hearing Sun Ru's elder tone suddenly made her realize something.</p>

    <p>In addition, this is in the ancestral land of the Sun family. Sun Rong almost immediately had several more likely answers in his mind.</p>

    <p>But before she could guess, Sun Ru introduced herself to her family: "I am your ancestor, Sun Ru. But there is a big gap in generations between you and me. So, just call me Grandma Taizu."</p>

    <p>"Grandma Taizu..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... this situation is not too different from what she imagined...</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong was still surprised by this operation of bringing his great-grandmother directly from the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Sun Ying'er transferred all the information about Sun Ru synchronized by Wang Ying to Sun Rong's own memory.</p>

    <p>It was not until now that Sun Rong found out. It turned out that Sun Ru had always regarded Wang Ling as the current head of the Sun family...</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter...</p>

    <p>She does not mind...</p>
