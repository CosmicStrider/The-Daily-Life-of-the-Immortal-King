  <h1>Chapter 1834 Gray Cult's first commission</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The turmoil in Glio City gradually subsided. With the help of Lawen as a chess piece, the Master Yuan Zun of Mixiu Country achieved his original goal. He gave a decisive blow to Maiko Assi, Heavenly Dao Alliance, Tengu and other small forces. Reshuffle and check and balance the major forces.</p>

    <p>After this incident, Tengu still seemed to be under the jurisdiction of the church. But now the actual Pope is Levis. And Levis has now joined the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>As a result, Tengu has developed into an intelligence network under the Office of Strategic Deception. However, the internal structure of Tengu is still very chaotic. Although those who can become Tengu are all elites, Lord Diulei believes that stricter standards must be set. In the end, At least morally you have to pass the test first.</p>

    <p>We must not let some people wear the guise of Tengu and do whatever they want in the name of selling information. Therefore, Lord Diulei is thinking about a strict reset structure and a reshuffle plan specifically for Tengu these days.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Liangzi also followed Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi back to the Huaxiu Kingdom. This time they also helped a lot in carrying out tasks in Glio City. At the same time, they also used the power of the Jiugong family to deal with the major black and white gangsters. In the end, Sun Rong was completely clarified in a very short period of time.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Jiugong Liangzi+Xiang Yi+Qin Zhong. This wonderful combination has not been fully understood by the mixed public opinion forces in Glio City.</p>

    <p>They are like a small knife hidden deep in a big cotton coat. They are dormant and waiting for a fatal blow at any time.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong never liked owing favors to others, but this time she knew she owed a big favor.</p>

    <p>Looking back, she has to find a chance to thank Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, January 6th. At Number 60 High School, Wang Ling and others studied in the morning the next day after returning to Huaxiu. The class was much livelier than usual. Many students from foreign classes came to join in the fun. Asking Wang Ling and others participated in a variety show.</p>

    <p>Most people don't know the truth. They just know that Sun Rong brought a group of people to participate in Mixiu Country's variety show to bring glory to the school. But there are different opinions in the class about what specific projects they participated in. Everyone has their own opinions.</p>

    <p>So many people came to the class early in the morning to directly seek confirmation from Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong. What type of variety show are you participating in? Running around tearing off name tags? Or are you traveling with another group of high school students and having a fight on the way?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Look at this reaction. It shouldn't be the ones mentioned above. Could it be that a group of people went to the wilderness to open up wasteland and use local materials to create homes or something?"</p>

    <p>"No...it's not..." the questions came one after another. Sun Rong was a little confused.</p>

    <p>"Isn't that right? You must be participating in some talent show!" Someone suddenly exclaimed: "A while ago, there was a talent show that printed QR codes on the milk boxes in order to vote for brothers and sisters. Some people just scanned the voting QR codes and did not drink milk in order to support their favorite people, and poured out all the milk! What a shameful waste!"</p>

    <p>"Such behavior is naturally wrong. But the variety show we participated in is similar to a secret room...it has nothing to do with it." Sun Rong had no choice but to explain: "And because there was a problem with the recording process, this variety show probably won't be broadcast anymore."</p>

    <p>At this time, after hearing the truth, a group of students in their 60s who came to Number 60 High School to eat melon sighed.</p>

    <p>"Oh. What a pity."</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai from Class 2 said: "Fang Xing and Li Youyue from our class were also there. I heard about some things. It is said that the one who is playing against our Number 60 High School this time is Mixiu Country, which ranks among the top universities in the rankings. The number one high school! Uzumaki Imperial High School!"</p>

    <p>"Oh! It's them! I've heard of this school. What are the six new prodigies that Uzumaki Emperor High School has picked up this year? They are already Golden Core in the first year of high school. Just like the teacher! The strength is terrifying!"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. The key is that they don't use much training resources. I heard that they get up purely through hard training and hard talent. This is the tradition of the Uzumaki Emperor in Glio City. Fully closed pressure training. Breaking through the limits every day."</p>

    <p>"So there are many people who can't hold on and drop out of school. But those who can stay are the best of the best."</p>

    <p>A classmate with knowledge of the matter said gushingly: "They relied on this extreme practice method until the third year of high school. Only the students who survive to the end will be able to concentrate resources to help them pass the test again. This training method has caused many people to be overwhelmed and dropped out of school. Therefore, the concentration of resources was relatively large. The upper-level students who persisted until the end could get more cultivation resources."</p>

    <p>"Doesn't that mean that when they reach the third year of high school, they will defy heaven?"</p>

    <p>"Well, it is said that in the Uzumaki Emperor, in previous years, people almost entered the Nascent Soul stage directly in high school. According to their life-threatening training method, they will be at least in the late Golden Core stage by the third year of high school."</p>

    <p>"The late stage of Golden Core...that's the level that many people can reach when they go to a ten-year cultivation university. At least they are in their fourth or fifth year!"</p>

    <p>"So whether it is in Glio City or other provinces and cities in Mixiu Country, the Uzumaki Emperor's combat power level is the first! If we can compete with them, it will actually be quite helpful for us to study the opponents of other cultivation countries."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, everyone. The future is long. There is always a chance."</p>

    <p>At this time Chen Chao suddenly said.</p>

    <p>It is also a pity for Chen Chao that the recording of this variety show challenge was stopped suddenly. The old Chen family always hopes to compete with the strong. The stronger the opponent, the easier it is to unleash their potential.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao knows that the few people in the Uzumaki Emperor are not weak. But if they from Number 60 High School join forces, Chen Chao feels that there may not be any chance of winning.</p>

    <p>You may not be able to defeat them alone. But when it comes to teamwork, Number 60 High School has gone through many ups and downs. Their tacit understanding is not weaker than that of any other high school.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact, when Chen Chao said the words "the days are long", Wang Ling already had a premonition that the day when he could meet the Uzumaki Emperor might not be too far away...</p>

    <p>During lunch break that day, Wang Ling saw Sun Rong writing the afternoon class schedule on the blackboard while constantly glancing at him.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's judgment. Sun Rong probably has something to say to him.</p>

    <p>He lowered his head and looked at the textbook, pretending that nothing happened. Sure enough, Sun Rong came over to him after finishing writing on the blackboard.</p>

    <p>Or was it because of Mrs. Lawen's request for her autograph?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had checked the notebook with pure gold edges several times and found no problems. So she thought about giving it to Wang Ling to have a look.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Can you check it for me?" She looked at the boy with a smile. She was about to reach out and take out the notebook from the storage bag in her arms. However, a group of boys lurking in the corridor suddenly swarmed over.</p>

    <p>"What! Which bold mascot wants to check up on classmate Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>"Damn it! It turned out to be a physical examination! How can it be repaired?"</p>

    <p>This group of boys was so excited that they rushed forward. The original quiet classroom immediately became chaotic.</p>

    <p>Everyone rushed in and Wang Ling was also shocked.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Wang Ling had no choice but to sigh inwardly. He snapped his fingers and paused time temporarily. Then he gently put his hand on Sun Rong's shoulder and moved to the student union office. Then he snapped his fingers again to release the pause.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushed: "Sorry Wang Ling... I didn't expect so many people to be eavesdropping. I think it would be safer to come to the student union office next time."</p>

    <p>As she said that, she handed the notebook to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only glanced at it and returned the things.</p>

    <p>"Eh? No problem?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"No." Wang Ling replied. Cherish words like gold.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She let out a long sigh of relief and said, "That's good...it seems like I'm overthinking..."</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, at the door of the student union office, a girl from another class suddenly stumbled in and threw herself on the ground. Her face was red and she was looking for her glasses on the ground. She apologized: "Sorry... I'm sorry... President Sun Rong, I didn't hear anything! I didn't even hear you say you missed classmate Wang or anything like that!"</p>

    <p>"What I just said is that I think too much. It's not that I miss my classmate Wang..." Sun Rong held her forehead. She felt that her face was so hot that it could be roasted.</p>

    <p>"Oh. That's it. Then it's okay."</p>

    <p>The girl found her glasses. Then she quickly put them on and got up from the ground.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the girl's face and finally asked: "I remember you are in Class 1 of the ordinary class. Classmate Chen Qin?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! It's me!" The girl with glasses said excitedly: "As expected of the president Sun Rong. She has very strong business skills! I heard that the student union office can accept delegation. Is it true?"</p>

    <p>"Delegation?" Sun Rong and Wang Ling blinked simultaneously.</p>

    <p>"That's right. I heard that there is a Gray Cult... that can help people solve their problems."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is speechless.</p>

    <p>She knew very well that this thing about helping people solve their troubles originally meant that Gray Cult could help its members and classmates who had letters of recommendation from their members solve the problem of endorsement difficulties.</p>

    <p>After all, Gray Cult is essentially just a literary organization.</p>

    <p>What Sun Rong never expected was that things would actually reach this point...</p>

    <p>I was just about to prepare my words to refuse. But the girl named Chen Qin showed an expectant expression and grabbed Sun Rong's hand: "President! Can you hear me finish my story? Just A moment! I heard that you can directly find Master Gray Cult... Master Gray Cult is a very emotional person. Maybe he can help me solve my troubles! Of course. Even if you don't accept my commission, it doesn't matter!"</p>

    <p>"But..."</p>

    <p>"I'm not someone who likes to get things for free. If I shamelessly ask for help, I naturally have to show some appreciation. I understand this!" The girl named Chen Qin said, "The canteen in our school is actually outsourced to my father. If President Sun Rong agrees to help me pass on the message, whether she accepts it or not, she can choose whatever she wants from the canteen this year! Of course, if President Sun doesn't like this privilege, she can pass it on to someone else!"</p>

    <p>"So, are there any new snacks in the school canteen this year?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"There are no new ones. But there are snacks with new flavors. Potato chips, potato sticks, crispy noodles and so on. Various flavors." Chen Qin said.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong, she took a deep breath. She stepped forward and held Chen Qin's hand: "You have an easier road, sister!"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin: "Ah?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I mean...now you can speak out about your dreams!"</p>
