  <h1>Chapter 2176 Wang Muyu's Dragonborn Magical Weapon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu's expression suddenly became solemn. There are only two possibilities for his core world to fail to suppress Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>First, the spiritual space controlled by the other party is more advanced than his own. In other words, Qiao Yanyuan is likely to have mastered the power of the supreme world. That is the supreme spiritual space that overrides the core world. As long as Qiao Yanyuan wants to go there It can engulf its core world at any time.</p>

    <p>But the other party doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment...</p>

    <p>Then there is only one possibility left. Qiao Yanyuan may have the same level of spiritual space as himself. But the number is sufficient.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu has long known about Qiao Yanyuan's dragon-born ability. This sixth man can annex himself from other parallel dimensions and gather strength in a short time. He can continuously stack buffs for himself. He is also the one with the most special ability among all the dragon-borns that Wang Muyu has come into contact with. of one.</p>

    <p>So special. Even though Wang Muyu had mastered the strengths of hundreds of dragon descendants, he retrieved his own memory and knew nothing about the abilities Qiao Yanyuan had.</p>

    <p>"His heart is very complicated." Yi Jianchuan looked up at the body of Qiao Yan Yuan Fen, who was high up. His white eyebrows furrowed. He could hear some terrible sounds like torrents and waterfalls venting in the heart of this body. It seemed that countless creatures were imprisoned inside. It was very noisy. also very harsh.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan immediately judged that it was these sounds from different spaces accumulated in this person's body that gave this avatar such amazing combat power.</p>

    <p>It's like a balloon that keeps inflating.</p>

    <p>"Can even one's body be divided into two parts to use such a special dragonborn ability?" Wang Muyu gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, he made no secret of it. He put a layer of psychic shield on Yi Jianchuan with his backhand and then stepped on the ground. It turned into a spiritual light and rushed to the sky. This move was earth-shattering. The surrounding colorful sacred mountains exploded and shattered into pieces. Pieces of glass sputtered around.</p>

    <p>Many seven-color lines appeared on Wang Muyu's small fist, bursting out with blazing light. It was like an ancient forbidden spell, giving people a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The nine heavens and ten earths are falling apart.</p>

    <p>The expression on his body remained unchanged. Tong Kong's eyes always followed Wang Muyu's movement. He opened his hand to receive the punch forcefully.</p>

    <p>A huge explosion occurred in the sky. The impact of energy that penetrated the sun and moon destroyed the Qise Mountain in the distance. It was directly crushed into powder.</p>

    <p>"That's it?"</p>

    <p>That body was obviously not afraid of Wang Muyu's impact. He grabbed his fist and flicked it with his backhand, then threw Wang Muyu directly. The strong inertia allowed Wang Muyu to penetrate several mountains in a row.</p>

    <p>Although such a real dragon battle has not been recorded in movies in the modern world of cultivation, the frontal pressure of watching a battle at such a close distance is rarely seen.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan clenched his fists. As a teacher, he knew very clearly at this moment that this battle was not something he could intervene in.</p>

    <p>Whether it is Wang Muyu or this body, the combat power of the two of them is far beyond his own. The holy realm is the strongest realm below the Tao realm. Above the Tao realm is the ancestral realm. The combat power of these two people is probably already at the ancestral realm. Yes. This is a legendary realm. It only existed during the eternity of time.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan didn't expect that he, an old man, could still witness the battle in the ancestral realm with his own eyes.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>In the body of the clone, the countless Qiao Yanyuan who were absorbed from the parallel space roared one after another. They were almost hysterical. They will forever become a part of the clone and cannot return to the parallel space until they complete their mission.</p>

    <p>So everyone is anxious. Although they are unwilling to stay in the clone body, they all just want to complete the task quickly. Because of this, they are forced to unite.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's punch just now was just to test his strength. He did not really release his full combat power. He thought that the moment he came into contact with this body, he would be able to find out the true combat power of this body.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, he still had no accurate estimate of the clone in front of him...</p>

    <p>"Are you still absorbing yourself from other parallel dimensions? You're not afraid of pushing yourself to death..." Wang Muyu became nervous. For the first time, he began to feel a sense of crisis. He was not afraid of being hurt, let alone being taken away.</p>

    <p>But right now, his teacher Huaxiu Sword Master is also here. He is worried that he will not be able to protect his teacher's safety.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the clones in Qiao Yanyuan's body were roaring. Countless pairs of ethereal dragon claws extended from his back, erupting with the strongest energy and blood. It was like a torrent of wild beasts grabbing at Wang Muyu from all directions.</p>

    <p>"Can even limbs become part of oneself?" Wang Muyu and Yi Jianchuan were both stunned.</p>

    <p>These extended dragon claws have their own thoughts. One wave is grabbing at Wang Muyu. The other wave is carving runes together on the void behind that body.</p>

    <p>"The end of the Dragon God!"</p>

    <p>A huge ancient magic circle lit up directly in the void. It released astonishing mana fluctuations and directly imprisoned the entire world. Under this grand pressure, seven-color mountains were uprooted. The entire core world was everywhere. Annihilate, destroy.</p>

    <p>This avatar of Qiao Yanyuan stood in the void. Like a demon. The crystal-like alien body emitted dazzling light.</p>

    <p>"Fight with you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu clasped his hands together. Spiritual light surged in his hands, and a glass horn appeared. This was the first time he sacrificed his dragon-born magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Even when he was in embarrassment during the previous battle with Jingze, Wang Muyu was never forced to this point.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qiao Yanyuan smiled in that body: "Finally, I let you use your dragon-born magic weapon."</p>

    <p>The preciousness of this glazed horn is self-evident.</p>

    <p>It is equivalent to the essence of Wang Muyu's life. It is a dragon-born magic weapon that gathers the leaders of hundreds of schools. It can be said to be the most precious of all dragon-born magic weapons at present!</p>

    <p>Moreover, Glazed Horn also has strong growth potential.</p>

    <p>Their purpose of bringing Wang Muyu back was to make the little guy recognize his ancestors and return to his clan. He should not recognize a thief as his father.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I naturally came here for Wang Muyu's dragon-born magic weapon.</p>

    <p>The dragonborn magic weapon is the most precious thing in a dragonborn. Even if it is only slightly damaged, the dragonborn himself will suffer corresponding backlash. It can be said that this is one of the life gates of the dragonborn.</p>

    <p>As long as you hold this dragon-born magic weapon and control this little guy, it will be much easier than imagined!</p>

    <p>"snort!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu snorted coldly. He puffed up his little face and blew the glazed horn with all his strength! It only took a moment. The entire core world was shaken. A huge glazed dragon statue appeared out of thin air. It appeared like a dharma image. Behind Wang Muyu, he held a long sword in his hand and slashed away in the air.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>It was just one knife. The thousands of dragon claws he had captured were chopped off by him in an instant.</p>

    <p>"It's actually a summoning magic weapon..." Qiao Yanyuan's clone was surprised. He didn't expect that the Glazed Horn was actually a summoning magic weapon.</p>

    <p>For a while, thoughts kept surging in his mind. But even though he had read through the history of the dragon clan, he never thought that there had been such a glazed dragon god holding a long sword in the long history of the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>Who is this?</p>
