  <h1>Chapter 1902 Don't want to be captured?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Entering the 4.0 version was designed by Wang Ling in advance. And obviously he had already expected that Lord Ma would have this battle. Therefore, he did not use his King's Eyes fire to temper Lord Ma's body.</p>

    <p>Yan? didn't expect that she would be used in turn. Using dragon flames on Lord Ma, he successfully completed the final tempering of the body.</p>

    <p>At this time, the aura of Lord Ma, who has entered the 4.0 enlightenment version, is even stronger than before. An astonishing magic is released from the whole body. At the same time, ten vortexes surge up behind him. It is a cave space. It can swallow everything. It has a powerful Destructive power. Everything that comes close to the whirlpool cave will be shattered like being sucked into a black hole.</p>

    <p>Yan? felt tremendous pressure. She opened her dragon wings. The wide crimson dragon wings formed dozens of fire tornadoes and rolled forward.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>However, Lord Ma only raised his hand. The ten whirlpools behind him moved in unison. Like a magic ball, they swirled forward with a kind of agile power.</p>

    <p>Before the fire tornado even got close to Lord Ma's body, it was completely disintegrated by the whirlpool cave. It was swallowed directly. No trace was left behind.</p>

    <p>"So strong!" Lord Diulei was shocked. He admired Father Wang even more. He thought that all this was within Father Wang's plan.</p>

    <p>He even thought of using dragon flames to complete body tempering in reverse. This made Lord Ma's overall strength several times stronger than before!</p>

    <p>Yan?'s attack was completely ineffective. These ten whirlpool caves were like an airtight barrier, firmly protecting Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>With a wave of his hand, the flaming lake under his feet began to be absorbed by the ten-mouth whirlpool cave sky, forming a grand scene of a dragon sucking water.</p>

    <p>In just a short period of time, this flaming lake has been drained by Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>However, after being burned, the earth has been reduced to a piece of scorched earth. There is no grass growing within a hundred miles. Lord Ma has something on his mind. He originally wanted to teach Yan? and fight her back.</p>

    <p>But now he doesn't think so in his mind. Since this is the mistake made by Yan?, then at least he should capture this girl alive and suppress her here. Let her plant trees until the ecology of this area is restored.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In an instant, his body emitted golden light. The ten holes in the sky moved together and turned into cages to suppress Yan?</p>

    <p>The moment she was surrounded by ten holes in the cave. She opened her eyes wide with a look of horror. She sacrificed the dragon-born magic weapon, the Burning Sky Chain Hammer. This was a light-level dragon-born magic weapon. As a result, it was unable to stop the advancement of the cave.</p>

    <p>After the chain hammer was sacrificed, the entire magic weapon was swallowed up by the cave. She couldn't believe that she would be defeated by a spirit.</p>

    <p>Everything happened too suddenly. At the moment when the ten holes of the cave were completely merged, Yan?'s body was directly swallowed up and disappeared directly into the void.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Ma didn't kill her, right?" the little sheep asked.</p>

    <p>"No." Lord Ma shook his head: "I want her to help us clean the courtyard and tidy up the nearby ecology. Everything was burned by her. She should pay the price for it."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Lord Ma opened his palms. A piece of fiery red dragon scale lay quietly in his palm. This was taken out by him during the duel with Yan?</p>

    <p>Then he snapped his fingers and sent the dragon scale to the far shore. The person who received the dragon scale was none other than Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren's real body was playing chess with Fenmu Shen. Facing the dragon scale that suddenly appeared in Qipan Mountain, Peng Xiren's face was filled with clouds.</p>

    <p>These days, in order to escape the imprisonment of Dao Ancestor Wang's Dharma Spirit "Zheng", he thought of countless ways. Finally, he successfully escaped from Zheng by using the golden cicada's escape method. And found Fenmu Shen and Bai Zhe's asylum.</p>

    <p>And right from the beginning, this way of escape was also what Bai Zhe had thought of.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren knew that he was not strong enough and could not be Zheng's opponent. Therefore, he decided to join Bai Zhe's camp.</p>

    <p>He left behind his body and half of his soul. With the help of Bai Zhe, he imported the other half of his soul into this new body.</p>

    <p>This is a new body specially shaped for him by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>The dragon body created with the dragon bone gene of the Dark Devouring Dragon is now controlled by Peng Xiren. Peng Xiren thought his plan to escape was perfect, and he only needed to wait for him to fully adapt to the body of one of the three leaders of the dragon clan, so that he could find Zhe again, or even confront Wang Ling directly to complete his revenge plan.</p>

    <p>But now, facing the disgusting dragon scales that were suddenly teleported to him, he suddenly became stupid.</p>

    <p>"Why did you give me Yan?'s dragon scales?" Peng Xiren frowned.</p>

    <p>The plan to introduce Wang Ling and others into Eternal Life was also the one he first proposed. He thought that everything he did to fuel the flames in secret would not be discovered by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now Lord Ma's teleportation suddenly tightened Peng Xiren's heartstrings.</p>

    <p>"Don't be too nervous. I thought this was just a test. Your appearance and aura have all changed. Now you are a new generation of dragonborn with the Dark Devouring Dragon gene. In addition, you have the power of the old days in your hands. It is the old days and dragons. A perfect combination of power... As long as you are cultivated, you will become one of the strongest war machines in our camp."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen said in deep thought. He held the dragon scale between his two fingers and frowned slightly: "Yan? Defeat. It's expected. There's no need to worry too much. The Wang family is already extraordinary. I can't even deal with it. With her. How can it be possible on her own?"</p>

    <p>"So. You did it on purpose?" Peng Xiren asked.</p>

    <p>"There is some kind of bond between Jingze and Yan? If Yan? is captured, it will make Jingze unswervingly consider the issue from our standpoint."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen said: "He was already shaken. After this disaster has passed, Mr. Bai and I are convinced that he will give up all illusions and become ours."</p>

    <p>At this point, Peng Xiren understood instantly.</p>

    <p>However, there was one more thing that he still couldn't figure out: "What's going on with Wang Muyu?"</p>

    <p>"Bringing back the baby Wang Muyu was indeed within our plan. It has not changed. But Mr. Bai did not expect that the newborn Wang Nuan would be so domineering."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen laughed. He was now the transformed form of Sotos. He was covered in floating foam. He looked like a bunch of shining purple grapes.</p>

    <p>When you laugh, these bubbles on your body will float, popping up and re-condensing.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. That girl is like a god of war. I feel like I can't take it away if I try to rob it normally. But her brother is even more terrifying. It took a lot of effort to say that her brother is trapped in eternity..."</p>

    <p>"I know." Fenmu Shen said: "This is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But it is unrealistic to force it now. It is better to plant some seeds for this little dragon while the boy is not around, so that he can find us on his own."</p>
