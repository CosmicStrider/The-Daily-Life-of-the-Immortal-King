  <h1>Chapter 1380 I do!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone couldn't help but feel amazed.</p>

    <p>He actually gave me a planet as a token of love.</p>

    <p>This kind of style is indeed in line with Dao Ancestor Wang's own handwriting.</p>

    <p>"Old God. Does it refer to the previous God Realm King?" At this time, Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Miss Ajuan nodded. She recalled many things over and over: "But the Old God has already emerged. After emerging, the God Realm has been without a master for a long time. It was only recently that the Old God's will chose me. Then .I became the new King of the God Realm."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception nodded.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it also a power transition mechanism that is activated?" Sun Ying'er interjected.</p>

    <p>This method is very familiar to Sun Ying'er. Because the inheritance on the Void side is also like this. The old Void Lord can pass on his power to the next generation.</p>

    <p>This method of inheritance is also called the "power transition mechanism." The advantage is that 100% of the power of the previous generation can be passed on to the next generation.</p>

    <p>However, there is also an obvious flaw: inheritance takes too long.</p>

    <p>So during this period, you have to survive.</p>

    <p>If you die during the inheritance process, then the previous generation will have to find a new successor. And the power that has been transferred will be in vain. It cannot return to the original body...</p>

    <p>"That's right. So my power is still slowly being inherited! The more power I inherit, the more wings I have behind me." Miss Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>The main reason why she worked so hard to be attentive to Wang Ling before. This is also the main purpose.</p>

    <p>Before inheriting 100% of the power of Old God, if Ajuan can hold Ling Zhenren's thigh, he can successfully complete the entire inheritance ceremony.</p>

    <p>"Although I have become the new King of the God Realm, I still don't know why Old God chose me."</p>

    <p>At this time, Miss Ajuan sighed: "I'm still too young! Now the Heavenly Dao star is out of control. I have no choice at all!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei has basically understood the situation.</p>

    <p>The current situation on Heavenly Dao is out of control. It is obviously not Miss Ajuan's fault.</p>

    <p>After all, no one would have thought that after the destruction of the Unspeakable Land, the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube would cause an imbalance in the power of chaos in the universe.</p>

    <p>And now the Heavenly Dao star is beginning to devour other planets out of control. It is very likely that it is also the revenge of the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quietly listened to the messages in the group.</p>

    <p>He already knows the reason why the Heavenly Dao star is out of control.</p>

    <p>Since the Heavenly Dao star is related to Dao Ancestor Wang. Dao Ancestor Wang gave this planet to the God Realm Old God as a token of love... Then it is very likely that there is something hidden in the Heavenly Dao star. Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quickly sent this speculation privately to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The two people's thoughts were almost as if they had withdrawn.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling just had a private chat with me and expressed his opinion. He feels that there is probably a Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube hidden in the Heavenly Dao star."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan was startled: "Ah? Really?"</p>

    <p>"To prevent the Heavenly Dao star from spiraling out of control, we must first find the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and suppress the riots in the Rubik's Cube."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "But Brother Ling also said it. It is easy to take out the Rubik's Cube... but it is more troublesome to do it without destroying the Heavenly Dao star. The best way is to send people deep into the Heavenly Dao star. Searching, but this matter, has certain dangers."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi asked: "What about Master's opinion?"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord replied: "The Lord's plan is to let Er Ha go. It has become a mythical beast. This is just an experience."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "But! I want to go too!"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord smiled and said: "Er Ha still has half of the spirit of the mythical beast that has not been absorbed. The Lord wants Xiao Yin to enter the land of retrospect during this period and absorb the remaining spirit. In this case, you can also enter the mythical beast. Sequenced."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng asked: "Since there is a risk, why not let the poor monk go together?"</p>

    <p>"Senior has the task of collecting new Rubik's Cube materials. There is no need to bother Senior with finding the Rubik's Cube. However, Brother Ling really wants to find someone else to partner with Brother Gou. The two of them also have a mutual understanding."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei asked: "So. Does anyone come forward?"</p>

    <p>"I do."</p>

    <p>At this time, a voice that had been silent for a long time came.</p>

    <p>A voice as sweet as the echo of a clear spring. It is the voice of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Sun Rong girl is going?" Ajuan was surprised.</p>

    <p>"When she rescued me before, Miss Ajuan worked hard and put in a lot of effort. So, I'm willing to give it a try."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded and said: "There is Er Ha, Ying'er and the upgraded Aohai. I am very confident about it!"</p>

    <p>On the one hand, she wants to pay off the favor of Miss Ajuan.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this is indeed a rare experience.</p>

    <p>"Since Sun Rong girl has come forward, our Office of Strategic Deception will definitely help. This is indeed a rare opportunity for experience."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "But there is only one day left before Number 60 High School resumes school. Let's do this. Miss Sun will go and look for it first. The deadline will be the resumption day. If nothing is found before then, how about replacing someone? That's okay. It can guarantee Miss Sun's safety."</p>

    <p>"I understand! I won't let you seniors down!" Sun Rong's voice sounded particularly confident during the group call.</p>

    <p>Although now. She is the strongest Foundation Building period on earth.</p>

    <p>But she doesn't want to do a Foundation Building period forever.</p>

    <p>Maybe in terms of realm strength, she will never be able to catch up with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong is willing to work hard to shorten the gap between them.</p>

    <p>A healthy love will never make a person become depressed or even regress.</p>

    <p>Chasing hard and influencing each other so that each other becomes more mature and better people than before is the correct way to start a relationship.</p>

    <p>Chasing Wang Ling. It is destined to be a long process.</p>

    <p>But she.</p>

    <p>But he is willing to do it.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Junior School Girl. Your lines are wrong!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice of Zhuo Yi came, interrupting the girl's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is puzzled: "What's the problem?"</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey! According to the normal routine. Shouldn't you confess your love before departure? For example..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled. He imitated the voice of a girl. He deliberately made his voice very thin. He tried his best to imitate Sun Rong's tone and said, "Classmate Wang Ling! Wait until I come back." I will marry you!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior Zhuo!! This is a big group..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi ignored it at all. Instead, he imitated Wang Ling's voice: "Classmate Sun Rong. Will you marry me!"</p>

    <p>Then, the voice of Sun Rong came: "I do!"</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"</p>

    <p>Everyone in the crowd looked confused.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "This is the recording made when Miss Sun agreed to do the task. I recorded it."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Zhuo...I'm very curious. Why were you not sanctioned by my brother?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I know my master too well. At this time, it is the time for him to eat crispy noodles. He will not watch the group. He just left after his private chat with Zhenjun."</p>

    <p>Everyone marveled: "..."</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Zhuo Yi is indeed Ling Zhenren's direct disciple.</p>

    <p>A man who can go crazy on the verge of death and get absolutely nothing wrong...</p>

    <p>He knows Wang Ling so well!</p>

    <p>Then in the group. Zhuo Yi became even bolder.</p>

    <p>He continued to use Wang Ling's voice and Sun Rong's "I do" recording to inhumanely tease his schoolgirl.</p>

    <p>"Then classmate Sun Rong. Whether you are born, old, sick or dead. Are you willing to follow me?"</p>

    <p>"I do!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"So classmate Sun Rong. Are you willing to give birth to a monkey for me in the future?"</p>

    <p>"I do!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong covered his face and exited the call.</p>

    <p>She is so difficult!</p>

    <p>It was so early in the morning that my shadow was destroyed.</p>

    <p>What she said in the group was actually recorded again. Then Senior Zhuo ruined it!</p>

    <p>New people join the group. Sure enough, there are pitfalls everywhere!</p>

    <p>It seems that I have to be more careful what I say in the future.</p>

    <p>What if it causes trouble to classmate Wang Ling? This would be bad...</p>
