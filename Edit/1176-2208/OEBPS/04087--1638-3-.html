  <h1>Chapter 1638 What did you say you did to provoke him?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Such a large-scale artificial human army was displayed by Liu Renfeng in just a few breaths using the so-called "spreading beans to form an army." Then it was quickly fought in front of Wang Ling at the speed of the blink of an eye. Dressed up as this fifty-meter mecha.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not difficult to see. For today's matter, Liu Renfeng has obviously been preparing for a long time. It is almost impossible to mass-produce an artificial human force of this size in a short period of time. This takes time.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the cost of making these artificial humans is not cheap. Such a large-scale artificial human power is based on Liu Renfeng's accumulated experience. If it weren't for the help of someone behind, Wang Ling would find it really difficult to achieve.</p>

    <p>This is a woman who is scared of poverty. Her words are full of the evil flavor of capitalism...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can see that Liu Renfeng wants to make a comeback with this battle. With the almost inexhaustible resources in the infinite secret realm, she can build her own artificial human army. Then she will vigorously develop it. The industrial chain of artificial spiritual roots has been recorded in the history of the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that Mrs. Fengchu met him...</p>

    <p>It's just a matter of making a little money for yourself. Wang Ling doesn't quite understand why some people want to provoke him...</p>

    <p>In the void. Liu Renfeng uses its body to link the spiritual will of the Fire Phoenix Mecha.</p>

    <p>She does not need to perform any button control. She only needs to put her hands on the special spiritual transmission driver's seat to complete the integrated human-machine control.</p>

    <p>The huge Fire Phoenix mecha is slightly more flexible than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>In the sky above the primeval forest of the Infinite Secret Realm, a pleasant-sounding subwoofer song came from the Fire Phoenix Mecha.</p>

    <p>It's not so much a song as it is a very deep phoenix cry.</p>

    <p>Then two projectile knives with a width of more than ten meters popped out from the back of the mecha's arms.</p>

    <p>The fiery red flick knife. Accompanied by the singing of the subwoofer, it was attached with a layer of red aura.</p>

    <p>This is a combined spell that combines sound waves and enchantment effects. It is similar to the war cry effect of some spiritual beasts before a battle.</p>

    <p>At such a specific frequency, in addition to producing enchantments, it will also act on things around the battlefield.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng wanted to capture Wang Ling alive. Therefore, he used this method.</p>

    <p>Such a special frequency of Feng Ming can have a hallucinogenic effect under certain conditions. And she has just re-planned the frequency of Feng Ming based on Wang Ling's current state...</p>

    <p>It was determined that this was enough sonic power to overwhelm Soul Formation.</p>

    <p>However, under such a strong sound wave, the expression on Wang Ling's face remained unmoved.</p>

    <p>"You weren't affected at all?" Liu Renfeng was surprised. Then he saw the ant-sized young man below gently tiptoeing. After stepping on the void to reach an altitude of more than a hundred meters, he paused.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the void changed. Liu Renfeng saw the surrounding scene changing rapidly.</p>

    <p>The battlefield that was originally above the primeval jungle of the infinite secret realm quickly switched to this endless and deep universe in this short period of time. Liu Renfeng could see the Milky Way. It could even see the earth not far away...</p>

    <p>This is not the universe of the real world. It is constructed by Wang Ling. It can be said to be another universe that is completely copied from the universe of the real world.</p>

    <p>Go ahead. There is no other living being in this universe.</p>

    <p>"Inherent Spirit Realm?" Inside the Fire Phoenix mecha, Liu Renfeng widened his eyes. He was extremely shocked by the endless depth of the universe and the bright stripes of the Milky Way in front of him.</p>

    <p>She knows the existence of the inherent spiritual realm.</p>

    <p>But she didn't know that the place she was being pulled into at this moment was the "core world" that was more powerful than the inherent spiritual realm...</p>

    <p>Although the Fire Phoenix Mecha is large, it is as small as an ant against the backdrop of the cosmic environment.</p>

    <p>Although she was sitting in the mecha at this time, her brain felt like it had stopped functioning.</p>

    <p>And it was at this moment that Liu Renfeng was shocked to discover that Wang Ling's strength might be far beyond her imagination.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..." Her voice began to tremble.</p>

    <p>Then he began to launch an offensive frantically. Under the incompetent fury, two enchanted flick knives were ejected at an extremely high speed of sound, aiming at Wang Ling's head and cutting it off.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood motionless.</p>

    <p>Two flick knives struck him from left to right. The moment they hit his head, he didn't even lose his hair. On the other hand, the blade was shattered to pieces.</p>

    <p>Liu Yanfeng didn't realize that she was attacking a guy who was depressed.</p>

    <p>In extreme panic, more intense artillery fire covered Wang Ling from the various output ports of the Fire Phoenix mecha.</p>

    <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!--</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the core world of Wang Ling was exploded by various explosions. The Fire Phoenix mecha stored foldable nano-missiles. This is also a black technology developed by Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>Even the explosive power of a nuclear bomb is only as big as a grain of rice. Therefore, the ammunition reserve in the fire phoenix is huge.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want to open the barrier. Having a dirty school uniform is not a good idea. So Wang Ling put up a psychic barrier for them.</p>

    <p>An extremely thin barrier. The nano-missiles bombarded it indiscriminately. There was not even a crack.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! This is impossible!"</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Liu Renfeng has gone a little crazy. She is holding her head with a panicked expression.</p>

    <p>Then a dazzling holy light emerged from behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng: "This is..."</p>

    <p>Defeat the opponent in the area where they are most confident. This is Wang Ling's consistent approach.</p>

    <p>The previous Fenmu Shen thought he controlled time and space, but he was locked in a fixed ending forever.</p>

    <p>He can jump out of time and space. But he can't escape the ending that Wang Ling personally arranged for him.</p>

    <p>Just like the Liu Renfeng in front of me...</p>

    <p>Sow the beans and make an army.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that this is one of Liu Renfeng's most proud techniques.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, through nanotechnology combined with cultivation space folding technology, artificial humans with flesh and blood were instantly created. This matter would indeed seem quite incredible in the eyes of other cultivators.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling is standing in his own core world.</p>

    <p>Behind him emanates the immortal holy light. It remains motionless, just like the gods of the universe.</p>

    <p>Then. Buzz!</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling as the center point, this holy light turned into a circular shock wave. It was like a huge ripple vibrating in the center of the universe. It suddenly extended to hundreds of millions of light years away...</p>

    <p>Then Liu Renfeng felt that the dazzling light gradually dimmed.</p>

    <p>And as this holy light dissipated, what appeared in front of Liu Renfeng was an extremely horrifying scene.</p>

    <p>She saw countless Wang Ling in front of her, surrounding her!</p>

    <p>These clones emerged from Wang Ling's body. Each one of them exudes the starlight of the universe.</p>

    <p>Some are made of meteorites, some are made of stars, and even more... are made of dust.</p>

    <p>This holy light of Wang Ling turns all the nearby dust within hundreds of millions of light-years into itself!</p>

    <p>There are literally countless Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She couldn't tell it with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Then. Bang! There was a sound.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by Wang Ling's finger snap.</p>

    <p>Countless clones dispersed like the wind and returned to billions of dust in the universe...</p>

    <p>And with the sound of Wang Ling's fingers, Liu Renfeng completely woke up.</p>

    <p>She completely realized that her own realm level was not in the same dimension as the boy in front of her.</p>

    <p>That's it.</p>

    <p>This famous underground scientist Mrs. Fengchu:Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>Under great spiritual shock.</p>

    <p>Stopped thinking...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>PS: Do the math. How many people have stopped thinking? (Funny) Friends, you can post your answers directly in this chapter. Friends who are correct can contact the book club administrator Big Face Cat to receive a copy. A small red envelope.</p>
