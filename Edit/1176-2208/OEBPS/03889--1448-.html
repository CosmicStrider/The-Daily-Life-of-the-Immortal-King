  <h1>Chapter 1448 It's sweet</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi really longed for "supplements" in his heart, his reason finally defeated his desire.</p>

    <p>Because this is not the first time she has been tricked by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Once at that banquet of a wealthy family, Jiugong Liangzi believed in the evil spirit of Sun Rong and took a pill that was said to make the body develop rapidly.</p>

    <p>She thought this was her dream supplement. It turned out to be an extremely fast hair growth pill...</p>

    <p>This directly led to Jiugong Liangzi lying directly in a pile of hair when he woke up that night.</p>

    <p>Those who didn't know thought they were filming a sequel to "The Grudge"...</p>

    <p>However, that was a long time ago. Everyone has their naughty moments when they are young. Sun Rong is no exception.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong. Do you think I was fooled once? Will you be fooled a second time?" Jiugong Liangzi sneered in his heart and walked out of the bathroom confidently.</p>

    <p>"How are you, Miss? How do you feel?" The female bodyguard from the side came over and asked.</p>

    <p>"No. I didn't eat it because I thought about it. This might be a trap." Jiugong Liangzi said calmly.</p>

    <p>"Miss is wise." The female bodyguard nodded.</p>

    <p>She was secretly grateful for her young lady's wit: "Actually, if young lady is worried, you can give it to me to taste first next time. If you make sure it's not poisonous, then..."</p>

    <p>"What a beautiful idea." Jiugong Liangzi glanced at the female bodyguard and said, "You are already promising enough... If you get bigger, do you want to fill up a hot air balloon and go to the sky?"</p>

    <p>The female bodyguard fell silent: "..."</p>

    <p>She lowered her head and didn't dare to say anything. Jiugong Liangzi was still staring at her, and his eyes became more and more strange: "Wait a minute! Have you had plastic surgery?"</p>

    <p>"Plastic surgery? No..." The female bodyguard was panicked.</p>

    <p>"Really?" Jiugong Liangzi was doubtful.</p>

    <p>"No...I definitely didn't go for breast augmentation!" the female bodyguard said.</p>

    <p>"Who asked you this..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi frowned: "I mean, how do I feel about your eyes? They seem to be different from before. I remember you have double eyelids. How come you have dead fish eyes now?"</p>

    <p>"Dead fish eyes? No way!" The female bodyguard quickly took out her mobile phone and turned on the selfie mode to take a look. She spent a lot of money to get double eyelids. They are still perfect and dazzling under the filter.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi rubbed his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>She felt that she must have been too eager to find the boy with dead fish eyes, which led to some kind of hallucination.</p>

    <p>But these are harmless.</p>

    <p>The search for the dead boy with fish eyes must continue.</p>

    <p>She had just inspected 2 classrooms before.</p>

    <p>She was about to continue the search. But she saw those 60 High School friends walking towards her. They were all looking at her with dead eyes.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi slowly issued a question mark: "?"</p>

    <p>There are so many dead fish eyes in this school?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because of the news from Zhuo Yi in advance, Wang Ling was a little absent-minded in class all morning. He was afraid that Jiugong Liangzi would find him.</p>

    <p>So I have been secretly spying on Jiugong Liangzi's movements.</p>

    <p>The result was disastrous. Near noon, Jiugong Liangzi went back by himself...</p>

    <p>It is indeed the Huaguo Shuilian Group!</p>

    <p>He can actually develop something as magical as "the whole world is full of dead fish eye potion"...</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Wang Ling was still worried about letting Sun Rong know about her affairs. Is it a blessing or a curse?</p>

    <p>Now it looks like Wang Ling feels that maybe he was worrying too much.</p>

    <p>Relying on her family's technology and money making ability, the girl can actually provide him with a good cover.</p>

    <p>This time.</p>

    <p>Thank you so much Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Indeed. This is Wang Ling's heartfelt gratitude.</p>

    <p>He felt that he should express his feelings.</p>

    <p>"Would you like some crispy noodles?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling touched his chin. He felt a little confused.</p>

    <p>It would be a bit too obvious to serve crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>After all, he is probably the only person in this class who can give out crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>It's better to keep it simple.</p>

    <p>So, while Sun Rong was still in the student union office at noon, Wang Ling conveniently stuffed a White Rabbit toffee into Sun Rong's pencil case.</p>

    <p>This is another childhood snack that Wang Ling loves.</p>

    <p>It's just that I don't like it as much as the crispy noodles. It's just an ordinary liking.</p>

    <p>Sometimes in order to replenish the sugar in the body in time, Wang Ling basically carries 12 of them with him.</p>

    <p>Of course. The white rabbit toffee given to Sun Rong looks simple, but is actually enlightened.</p>

    <p>As for efficacy...</p>

    <p>We'll know after Sun Rong eats it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Liangzi, who thought there was something wrong with his brain, quickly returned to the high-end villa where he stayed.</p>

    <p>This is a piece of land specially purchased by the Jiugong family to facilitate Jiugong Liangzi's continued activities within Songhai City. The price of the entire villa is 600,000 per square meter. It is undoubtedly a proper aristocratic area.</p>

    <p>Jiugong's villa is divided into five floors including a basement. The two floors and above are Jiugong Liangzi's own space.</p>

    <p>The first floor is used to receive foreign guests, while the basement houses security personnel and some scientific researchers.</p>

    <p>"Are you feeling better, miss?" The female bodyguard poured Jiugong a glass of hot water.</p>

    <p>Neither she nor Jiugong expected that they would be tricked the first time they went to Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>A private doctor conducted a detailed examination on Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This is the accompanying doctor specially assigned by the Jiugong family to Jiugong Liangzi. He is a very young but very experienced young man.</p>

    <p>He has a very neat slicked-back hair and wears a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He is completely dressed like a social elite.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Dahe. How is the situation?" the female bodyguard asked looking at the doctor.</p>

    <p>Mucun Dahe quickly came to the conclusion: "The lady must have been intoxicated by some kind of hallucinogen."</p>

    <p>"Hallucinogens?" Jiugong Liangzi frowned: "I didn't take anything like that..."</p>

    <p>"You don't have to take it. It's a high-grade hallucinogen. Inhaling it is just as effective." Mucun Dahe put down the stethoscope and said.</p>

    <p>"Inhale..." Jiugong Liangzi seemed to realize something instantly.</p>

    <p>She didn't say anything. She just clenched her little fists.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the lady should already know which link caused the problem." Mucun Dahe tried hard to restrain his smile.</p>

    <p>"Stop talking nonsense. Is there any way to relieve the hallucinogenic effect?" Jiugong asked.</p>

    <p>"To remove the effects of hallucinogens, you need to prescribe the right medicine. However, including the analysis of ingredients and the time for research and development...it often takes a long time. The lady's symptoms are actually not very strong. They can be resolved on their own in about 2-3 days." Mucun Dahe said.</p>

    <p>"This time. I underestimated the enemy."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi sighed.</p>

    <p>"The days are long. Miss, there is no need to rush."</p>

    <p>Mucun Dahe said: "Master, the situation is in our favor now. So we just need to follow the steps. There will be no problem."</p>

    <p>"I know." Jiugong Liangzi nodded.</p>

    <p>Actually this time, although she was hooked.</p>

    <p>But for Jiugong Liangzi, it was not without gain.</p>

    <p>If the boy with dead fish eyes was not at Number 60 High School, then why did Sun Rong give her that potion to cover it up?</p>

    <p>This shows that she may be very close to the truth.</p>

    <p>And it seems like. Sun Rong must know something...</p>

    <p>At this time, the female bodyguard looked at the time and reminded: "Miss, the Internet celebrity technology expert you made an appointment with, Master Shou Chong, has already arrived at the door."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded: "Ask him to wait for me on the first floor. I'll change my clothes and go down."</p>
