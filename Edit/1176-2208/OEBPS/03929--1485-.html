  <h1>Chapter 1485 Boss Sun's Move</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong On the night when we went to the ancient street, Mr. Boss Sun still didn't fall asleep until late at night.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he felt a little nervous...</p>

    <p>Although he has always believed unswervingly in the boy he identified as.</p>

    <p>He won't do anything outrageous to his granddaughter.</p>

    <p>But Jiang Xiaoche's words inevitably made Boss Sun a little worried.</p>

    <p>An upright young man in adolescence. If he makes a mistake in a hot head, he will do something wrong...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan admits that he is quite an enlightened person. It is normal for young people to like each other and then release their emotions.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the old man does not object to the love behavior of his precious granddaughter. Because true love is a virtuous circle that can make each other better people.</p>

    <p>Even if we don't get together in the end, we can still gain a lot of growth and unforgettable experiences.</p>

    <p>And these things are precious treasures that cannot be erased in the journey of life.</p>

    <p>Sunday, December 13th.</p>

    <p>In the early hours of the morning, a phone call from Jiang Xiaoche woke up Boss Sun, who was deep in thought.</p>

    <p>"How's it going?" Boss Sun asked pretending to be calm.</p>

    <p>He wanted to know. Wang Ling's further actions after receiving the drawn room card...</p>

    <p>"Old man, I want to ask you a question first." Jiang Xiaoche said over the phone.</p>

    <p>"You said."</p>

    <p>"If a man did something to an unconscious girl..."</p>

    <p>"That's the behavior of an animal!" the old man frowned.</p>

    <p>"Then what if nothing is done..." Jiang Xiaoche continued to ask.</p>

    <p>"Is this girl pretty?" Boss Sun was confused.</p>

    <p>"Of course she is beautiful! Immortal in appearance!" Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"The monster is worse than an animal!" Mr. Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>The answer was definite. Jiang Xiaoche was suddenly happy: "Okay. Let me report the latest situation. Miss seems to have played all day today. She was too tired. She didn't return to her villa at night. She directly stayed at the Holiday Inn on Ancient Street."</p>

    <p>"No wonder Aunt Qiu told me. Rongrong didn't come back at night. Neither did this kid. At least he should have sent a message to say so."</p>

    <p>"That's not the point."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiang Xiaoche smiled and said, "The point is, that Wang Ling used the room card he drew to book a room for the young lady!"</p>

    <p>"Is this happening?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun's pupils trembled: "That classmate Wang Ling. Where is he now..."</p>

    <p>"He went back. After he checked in the room, he handed the room card to the front desk. He actually went home to stay."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche smiled and said: "At present, this is the situation. Does the old man have anything to say?"</p>

    <p>According to the logic of the first few questions, leaving the beautiful girl behind and going home alone is obviously an act of "worse than an animal."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was looking forward to Boss Sun's answer. As a result, he only heard Sun Yiyuan on the other side of the phone seem to let out a sigh of relief. Then he shouted loudly: "Okay! I knew it! Classmate Wang Ling won't let me down..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "Ah?"</p>

    <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>Grandpa Sun said, "This Presidential Suite card is worth a fortune. Even if student Wang Ling does not need to keep and sell, can also make a large sum. But he did not do this, which proves that student Wang Ling is a very strong concept of financial security."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling could obviously sell it. But when his classmate was tired, he took out the room card and opened a room for Rongrong so that she could rest as soon as possible. This proved once again. Classmate Wang Ling actually He is a very generous person."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"After opening the room, classmate Wang Ling chose to leave on his own initiative and go home to rest. He did not take advantage of others' danger to do such deviant behavior. This shows that classmate Wang Ling is an upright and kind-hearted good boy! As expected of him. Rongrong... you really have a good sense..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Mr. Boss Sun began to shed tears.</p>

    <p>He himself was almost moved by what he said.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche remembered that Boss Sun clearly didn't say that just now!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The other side.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's laboratory, the DNA analysis report for the Silver Horn Man has been released. Comparison of the data database shows that in the large database that has been included, there is no DNA gene that matches the current data.</p>

    <p>In other words, the matching completely failed.</p>

    <p>This is a large shared database of the International Alliance of Cultivators. After Heavenly Dao was recruited, the alien information here is as thick as an encyclopedia.</p>

    <p>However, after comparison, Wang Ming found that not one DNA match was successful. This was something he did not expect.</p>

    <p>Although Guo Ping is currently mainly responsible for connecting with extraterrestrial civilizations, many of these extraterrestrial civilizations only learned about the Earth through the Heavenly Dao star.</p>

    <p>But in fact, human cultivators have never stopped exploring extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there are aliens lurking in the world of human cultivation. This matter is by no means groundless.</p>

    <p>If we say that the aliens related to the Silver Horns came to the earth a long time ago and mingled in the society of human cultivators with the help of human skin clothing.</p>

    <p>It is not surprising that there is a lack of data in such a large database.</p>

    <p>They have been mixed in human society for many years. Clothed in human skin, they have already established themselves... perhaps they can also be found among the upper echelons of mankind.</p>

    <p>Find a way to hide your traces. It may be easy.</p>

    <p>So to be on the safe side, Wang Ming used his own technical means to re-screen the alliance's large database.</p>

    <p>Finally, he sighed: "Sure enough, there are no traces of being abnormally cleared."</p>

    <p>There is only one way now. That is to start with the private files of various countries. Maybe there will be new discoveries.</p>

    <p>The alliance's large database is all public information.</p>

    <p>None of this is a secret.</p>

    <p>But as human beings, selfishness is actually the norm... between countries. There may be additional secrets that have not been disclosed and are included in special top-secret files.</p>

    <p>But it's not that difficult to steal this file.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ming can do it. There are many issues to consider.</p>

    <p>Because if he fails, not only will his personal information be exposed, but his country will also be implicated.</p>

    <p>Look at Wang Ming's serious thinking look on his face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly thought of a famous line: "My lover is this country."</p>

    <p>He felt that this sentence was also very suitable for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Xiaoer does make mistakes sometimes, once he gets serious and enters his professional field to explore academic issues, this man seems to be a completely different person.</p>

    <p>"Give me three days. I will try as much as possible. But for safety reasons, once there is a risk of exposure, I can only retreat. Whether I can get the data depends on luck." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>Then a golden light hit Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"What is this..."</p>

    <p>"Great Luck Technique." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"Oh. It's the spell you used before that can greatly increase luck, right?" Wang Ming said: "In other words, I have become the European Emperor now?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"But you know what, brother. There's a different meaning to the Emperor now."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"Using the language of Sun Island. Ou also means European. Then combine it with the concept of "emperor." It means people with big breasts."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>
