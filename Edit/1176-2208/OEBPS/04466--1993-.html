  <h1>Chapter 1993 Disciples of the Sword Master</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's very clear. Today's incident of recruiting disciples actually reflects to a certain extent a kind of involution in recruiting disciples among the upper-class cultivators in the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>In the information age, upper-level cultivators are no longer limited to the strength of their personal abilities. Being strong yourself is nothing. The key is to have a good disciple.</p>

    <p>If the apprentice lives up to his expectations, the master's face will naturally shine.</p>

    <p>But in the modern world of cultivation, under the background of the scientific era where all people practice cultivation, although there are so many cultivators, it is still a big problem to select talents with the same path as yourself and unique talents.</p>

    <p>What happened today can reflect from the side how hungry the powerful people are today.</p>

    <p>According to the information learned by Wang Ling, there are currently two ways for powerful people to recruit disciples.</p>

    <p>One type is particularly well-established. They will choose to start as casual cultivators and directly open a sect. In this way, they can pass the sect entry test to directly filter out a group of young cultivators who are not very good. Then they can pass the subsequent tasks, trials, and levels. They will be selected through various tests. Let these people go from the outer sect to the inner sect step by step. Finally, they will be the true successors.</p>

    <p>The advantage of this is that you can cast a wide net and receive many disciples. In the end, you will definitely be able to recruit satisfactory true disciples to continue your legacy.</p>

    <p>However, there are also disadvantages to opening a sect.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone in the current sect can be like the Office of Strategic Deception. It has already achieved huge profits in less than a year since its establishment.</p>

    <p>The vast majority of sects have been losing money every year since their inception. What is being consumed is the personal foundation accumulated by the sect leader who started as a casual cultivator over the years.</p>

    <p>Once you make a mistake during the operation, you will face a situation where both people and money will be lost.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there was also a P2P sect trap a few years ago. Several well-known casual cultivators in the industry raised funds in the name of jointly establishing a sect. In the end, there were many cases of running away after getting the money...</p>

    <p>All in all, the risk of opening a sect is still very high. And if it is not done well, it will damage the financial resources. The gain will not be worth the loss.</p>

    <p>The operation of the sect is far from simple as it seems. As long as it is open, it will be a huge gold-swallowing beast.</p>

    <p>Therefore, casual cultivators such as Cang Long, Luo Lan, and Liu Yong, due to their different concepts of financial management and the self-knowledge that their personality is not enough to manage a large sect, will choose to search for corresponding talents and accept them as disciples. Cultivation.</p>

    <p>So in Wang Ling's opinion, this matter cannot be considered in detail.</p>

    <p>After all, what happened to Li Changzhe in the spirit world training ground must be the secret of Jiutian Jingmi Academy. Except that Luo Lan was contacted deliberately by Zhuo Yi... How did Liu Yong and Cang Long know about this matter? What about the ones who came to your door?</p>

    <p>The answer seems to be obvious. That is, there are other people in Jiutian Jingmi Hospital who leaked the news.</p>

    <p>After defeating Cang Long and Liu Yong in succession, Lord Diulei knew very well that the next sword master was actually a tough nut to crack.</p>

    <p>Sword Master Yi Jianchuan has been looking for his true disciple for a long time.</p>

    <p>During the six-school joint military training exercise, he even set his sights on Wang Ling. Fortunately, Immortal Toya came to the rescue in time, and the Sword Master diverted his attention.</p>

    <p>As a retired general, his intelligence and abilities are naturally extraordinary. Therefore, it is not surprising that the sword master knows Li Changzhe's performance in the spirit world trial field.</p>

    <p>That move {Huitian Sword Technique}. Teng Luchen once guessed that it was taught by the Sword Master himself. Perhaps it was after checking with the Sword Master that the Sword Master knew about Li Changzhe's existence.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this also highlights the "rare and valuable" aspects of Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>He obviously never taught Li Changzhe the Huitian Sword Technique. But this young man can do it on his own!</p>

    <p>This is nothing but genius!</p>

    <p>Isn't this the talented disciple he, the Sword Master, has been searching for all his life?</p>

    <p>Of course, the Sword Master also stopped for a while. He was no longer obsessed with pursuing his disciples.</p>

    <p>That was the time when Yi Zhiyang rose to prominence.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang, the chairman of the student union of Jian Shen College, is also his adopted son. Although his talent is not as outstanding as the sword master imagined, he is actually quite passable. In addition, he has a strong understanding of swordsmanship. Therefore, the sword master was once a Yi Zhiyang will be trained according to the plan of a true disciple.</p>

    <p>But who would have thought... After the Jiulong Mountain Physical Martial Arts Competition, Yi Zhiyang's psychological shadow is still not completely resolved.</p>

    <p>So now he has come up with the idea of recruiting new true disciples.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Wang Ling are both clear-eyed at this moment. The Sword Master is the hardest nut to crack at this moment.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei is not completely helpless.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Lei, you should be very clear about my standards. If you are an ordinary person, you will definitely not be able to catch my eye."</p>

    <p>The sword master chuckled and said: "By the way, if the person you want to recommend to me is the Sun Rong girl, I think it's better to waive it... I've never thought of taking Sun Rong as my wife. Apprentice. After all, I am quite familiar with that old guy Sun Yiyuan. But when the old guy heard that I have to endure hardships to practice swordsmanship, he refused to give up his granddaughter to me."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Lord Diulei nodded slightly. He had actually heard about this matter.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that Mr. Boss Sun cherishes his granddaughter and holds it like the apple of his eye. It is normal for him not to let go.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei feels that there is really no need for Sun Rong to learn any swordsmanship from the Sword Master...</p>

    <p>Just kidding. This is the number one Foundation Building on earth...</p>

    <p>There is the passive ability of the nine-core Aohai man and sword! If you really want to unleash all your combat power, even the sword master can't beat it!</p>

    <p>But from the beginning, what Lord Diulei wanted to recommend to the Juggernaut was actually not Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Yi Lao. The person I want to recommend fully meets your expectations, Yi Lao."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled and said: "And this person is younger than the two people I recommended before."</p>

    <p>"Oh? It's a little baby?" Yi Jianchuan's eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

    <p>He has believed from a long time ago that since he is practicing swordsmanship, the younger he should be, the better. Although teenage high school students are also very young, they are not as effective in teaching as a child who is only a few years old.</p>

    <p>Don't underestimate that there may only be a few years' gap. But childhood is an important time to lay a solid foundation. As long as the foundation is solid, the path of spiritual practice in the future will definitely be smooth and skyrocketing!</p>

    <p>The Sword Master likes children. Lord Diulei is naturally aware of this.</p>

    <p>Among the top ten generals, except President Qi, they are already married and have children. Most of the others are still single. There has been a trend of adopting children...</p>

    <p>Even if you don't have children, you still have to create children and take care of them. In a sense, this is also the cute side of Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>"The person I want to recommend is named Wang Muyu. Although he is young, Yi Lao can rest assured. He is absolutely reliable." At this time, Lord Diulei said confidently.</p>

    <p>He is now pushing Wang Muyu out. In fact, it is also one of Wang Ling's arrangements.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu, the omnipotent little dragon who knows everything, is asked to practice Sword. With this little guy's talent, he can easily catch it. So from the beginning Wang Ling, he actually didn't expect Wang Muyu to learn any Sword next to the Sword Master.</p>

    <p>But I hope this little guy can learn more from the sword master's awe-inspiring righteousness.</p>

    <p>The little guy is still young. He also needs such a guide on the road of life...</p>

    <p>Sometimes what one person learns from another person does not necessarily have to be a skill. It can also be a variety of sunny spirits.</p>
