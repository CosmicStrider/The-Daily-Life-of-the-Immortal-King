  <h1>Chapter 1763 Sun Rong's alienation plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>New Year 4397. Friday, January 2. This is the third day after Jiang Yingying was rescued.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has found that Sun Rong's time spent with him has plummeted recently. She leaves in a hurry as soon as school is over every day. In addition to reminding him through text messages in the past few days, to remembers to visit Wang Muyu. Nothing else was mentioned to him.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, Wang Ling remembers that she would always try her best to find topics. Just to chat with him a few more words.</p>

    <p>Some exercises. Even though she knew how to do them, she still pretended not to understand and came to ask him... And Wang Ling, was also an honest person. Even though he had seen through her behavior, he did not tell her face to face. Instead, he took the trouble to do it. Took photos of his homework answers.</p>

    <p>Sometimes he recorded a video of solving the problem and sent it.</p>

    <p>Doing this. Wang Ling has no other meaning.</p>

    <p>The so-called reviewing the past and learning the new. Writing more questions will help consolidate memory and score points in the exam. This is what Wang Ling usually does. And in a sense, it is also a behavior that urges him to study.</p>

    <p>First time, second time, Wang Ling didn't feel disgusted at all. It was just to help solve problems. These are all easy tasks.</p>

    <p>However, in these days, Wang Ling found that Sun Rong's thoughts began to change a little. She stopped asking him any more questions. It made Wang Ling feel as if his life had become much more leisurely in an instant.</p>

    <p>He thought this should be considered a good thing.</p>

    <p>Because he is a "lone wolf" type of person. He should feel very comfortable when no one is "harassing" him.</p>

    <p>What's more, his life has been like this for the past seventeen years.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know why. Sun Rong After having less contact with him these days, he felt a special feeling... as if a piece of the puzzle was suddenly missing. It made him feel inexplicably uncomfortable. It is a feeling of "emptiness" that cannot be called "empty."</p>

    <p>But when he calmed down and thought about it carefully, he felt that this seemed a bit too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>Probably not...</p>

    <p>He has always been an emotionless person.</p>

    <p>How could such a feeling of "emptiness" arise?</p>

    <p>He picked up his phone and stared at the information window of the chat box Sun Rong for a long time.</p>

    <p>Fingers hovering on the Jiugong grid keyboard.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how much time passed before he typed four words: What are you doing?</p>

    <p>Then. Delete all four words.</p>

    <p>Still couldn't send it out.</p>

    <p>At that moment. Wang Ling suddenly felt that this was not like him at all.</p>

    <p>She didn't come to harass him. He should feel comfortable.</p>

    <p>"Ding!"</p>

    <p>At this time, a new message was suddenly sent, causing Wang Ling's phone to vibrate.</p>

    <p>The person who gave him the news was none other than Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if this little guy really has a connection with him. The message he sent to him actually had the same three words.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the "What are you doing?" on the screen for a while. Finally, he sent a string of ellipsis.</p>

    <p>For his father who never spoke human words. After getting a new mobile phone and learning how to use it, he frantically sent text messages to Wang Ling to greet him for a while. Wang Muyu also gradually became familiar with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, his "daddy" Wang Ling is the listening party and will not actively send text messages.</p>

    <p>In other words, under normal circumstances, the responses received are all ellipses.</p>

    <p>And the ellipsis means that his "dad" probably agrees with it.</p>

    <p>A full text messages will only be sent if he explicitly refused.</p>

    <p>"Come to see me tomorrow, daddy. Don't forget it!" Wang Muyu has just learned to use a mobile phone, but his typing speed is very fast.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The text message reminder ended. Wang Muyu, who had become a spy, quickly called Sun Rong. On the other side of the phone, Sun Rong's voice sounded embarrassed: "That... Muyu. How was your inquiring?"</p>

    <p>"Hey, Mom, it's still the same. I wonder if there is only one key for ellipsis on dad's cell phone." Wang Muyu complained. The slightly childish voice made Sun Rong couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong has been having a hard time holding back these past few days. She deliberately implemented an "alienation plan" and left with her bag as soon as school was over.</p>

    <p>Then she went to a deserted place and put on a new set of clothes and put on the nine-tailed fox mask. As a pretty girl, she made an appointment with Jiang Yingying to meet at a cultivation training center the size of a football field.</p>

    <p>This cultivation training center is a property of the Office of Strategic Deception. It was jointly invested and established by the Huaguo Shuilian Group. There were no outsiders inside during the trial operation.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong established a good relationship in advance. Obtained the key to the Cultivation Training Center and accompanied Jiang Yingying to train here.</p>

    <p>The relationship between her and Jiang Yingying has further improved in the past few days. In fact, the so-called "estrangement plan" was also proposed by Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>She didn't know whether it would work or not. But she still tried to treat a dead horse as a living horse. She planned to use it later... but now it seems that the effect is not obvious. It made Sun Rong feel a little regretful for a time.</p>

    <p>"Eh? The pretty sister's boyfriend hasn't responded yet?" Jiang Yingying couldn't help but ask while wiping his sweat and taking a break.</p>

    <p>"Not yet. And he's not my boyfriend yet..." Sun Rong replied with some disappointment. She also didn't expect that she would let Jiang Yingying become her love consultant.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Jiang Yingying herself actually has little experience in love.</p>

    <p>These so-called plans and routines of hers are all based on romance novels, romance comics, and various romance TV series.</p>

    <p>What about {Ton Pulling Lovers}, {Romance Full of Dirty}, {Meteor Garden}, {Mischievous Legs}, etc...</p>

    <p>Because there has been no progress between herself and Wang Ling. Sun Rong admits that she is indeed a little anxious.</p>

    <p>Originally, she went to Wang Ling every day to ask questions. It was also to get closer. Although Wang Ling ignored her at first, they recently responded to her with some problem-solving videos.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling did not say a word or type a word during the entire process. Even in the video sent, he did not show his face. He only filmed the process of solving the problem with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>But she just looked at Wang Ling's hands and the beautiful calligraphy. It was also pleasing to the eye!</p>

    <p>But now. She has implemented the "alienation plan"... and now nothing has been lost.</p>

    <p>"Pretty sister is so good. Sooner or later she will win."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying laughed: "The more times like this, the more you have to be patient. When the hero in the TV series encounters the heroine who suddenly ignores him, it will take a while to react. So, pretty sister, just do it Just wait for the wood to stick up by itself."</p>

    <p>"How long does it usually take?" Sun Rong asked, frowning.</p>

    <p>"Slowly. About...a few weeks?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong couldn't help but twitch the corner of her mouth.</p>

    <p>A few weeks...</p>

    <p>According to the understanding ability of this piece of wood, she felt that a few weeks would not be enough.</p>

    <p>Maybe it will take several years. Or more than ten years...</p>

    <p>And whether she can persist in liking Wang Ling for so long is also a question worth thinking about.</p>
