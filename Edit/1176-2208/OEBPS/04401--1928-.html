  <h1>Chapter 1928 Everyone Shows Their Magical Powers</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone faced the Jiutian Teahouse. At this time, they were all thoughtful. Originally, Li Changzhe thought that Qu Shuling had already entered. As a result, even the most powerful genius high school student was trapped outside the teahouse. This made Li Changzhe feel sad in his heart, shocked even.</p>

    <p>It seems that the door of Jiutian Tea House is difficult to break through with ordinary magic. The previous move of Qu Shuling's Meteor Flame Palm, the flames in the palm were all swallowed up as soon as it approached the door.</p>

    <p>Of course, Qu Shuling hasn't given up completely yet. His expression has completely darkened, and he looks like he wants to break through the teahouse door on his own.</p>

    <p>"Brother Li, what should we do?" People around were asking. Even though they could be considered leaders of the younger generation, they were still a little frightened when facing Qu Shuling and others.</p>

    <p>For many high school students, Qu Shuling is the top master among high school students. Except for the second brother Li Changzhe, no one here dared to talk to Qu Shuling directly.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Brother Qu has his own ideas. Let him try it first. With Brother Qu's superb level, if he can't break through, we will have no hope. At this time, we should stand aside quietly. Watch. Let's take a look at Brother Qu's battle. Let's learn from his battle experience." Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>His words sounded like those of an old man. There was almost no fault to be found. It even made Qu Shuling feel a little comfortable...</p>

    <p>But the problem is that after this speech, the pressure came to Qu Shuling. Li Changzhe put such a high hat on himself in front of so many people. If he still can't find a way to break through, he will be the one who is embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Click!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, an astonishing electromagnetic arc appeared between Qu Shuling's clasped palms.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Qu Shuling's aura increased in a brief moment. The strong sense of oppression caused everyone around him to take a few steps back.</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked. This was already the peak combat power of Golden Core in the later period... It was rumored that Qu Shuling would break through Nascent Soul soon. Everyone still didn't believe it. Now the sense of oppression caused by the release of this aura directly proved that Qu Shuling was strong. How powerful is the spirit?</p>

    <p>He is worthy of being the number one monk among high school students!</p>

    <p>At this time, there was an electromagnetic surge in Qu Shuling's palm. He controlled the magnetic field to convert the electromagnetism into an electric arc and accurately shocked his body. This was a method of using electromagnetic stimulation to stimulate acupuncture points. Qu Shuling's whole body was covered in energy in a short moment. His muscles swelled.</p>

    <p>He untied the upper part of his black gown and tied it around his waist. The swollen muscles in his upper body emitted sizzling arcs of electricity. Those muscles were like sponges that constantly absorbed water. After they swelled, they were compressed back into the body by Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>After repeated training in a short period of time, Qu Shuling's figure was finally maintained in a muscular state that was not too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>"Use electromagnetic stimulation of acupuncture points to achieve three-stage compression. Brother Qu is so fierce!" Li Changzhe looked at it with wonder. At the same time, he couldn't help but applaud. He was not stingy with his compliments. At the same time, he also felt sorry for Qu Shuling in his heart. He was shocked by this exaggerated electromagnetic control.</p>

    <p>He is indeed a genius who is proficient in the entire department.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next moment, Qu Shuling took action. The three-section compressed body made him as solid as a rock. This time he did not use any magic as a guide to attack. Instead, he purely used the power of his body to fight against the teahouse door.</p>

    <p>This was a punch that had been charged to the extreme. It was aimed at the door of the teahouse and came through the air. Considering Qu Shuling's current state, such a punch was enough to crack mountains and crack rocks!</p>

    <p>His speed was so fast that the people around him couldn't even see the trajectory of Qu Shuling's punch. The punch hit the teahouse door accurately.</p>

    <p>However, just when everyone thought that the teahouse door was about to be destroyed by Qu Shuling's punch, a golden vortex suddenly appeared on the door. Qu Shuling's fist seemed to have been directly driven into a ball of cotton. Then the whole person followed the punch, was sucked into the door.</p>

    <p>"That's it!" Seeing Qu Shuling being sucked away by the door of Jiutian Teahouse, Li Changzhe also understood. He immediately laughed: "It seems that this teahouse door has a power standard. If it really reaches the power recognized by the teahouse door. You will be directly connected."</p>

    <p>After understanding the rules, the remaining people were eager to try it.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this is a test of strength.</p>

    <p>You cannot use spells directly. But you can refer to Qu Shuling's method of using spells to stimulate the physical body first, increase the strength of your physical body, and finally break through forcefully.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Li Changzhe also thought that their power does not need to be as exaggerated as Qu Shuling. There must be a middle standard.</p>

    <p>If you have to reach Qu Shuling's level before you can enter, most of the people here have to squat in front of the teahouse.</p>

    <p>So after thinking for a short time, the high school students outside the teahouse began to show their talents one by one.</p>

    <p>The method used is consistent with Qu Shuling's - first use spells or other means to increase your own strength!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe stood in front of the door, trying to turn himself into mist again and pouring in from the crack in the door. As a result, after entering, he just hit the wall as a ghost and returned to the same place.</p>

    <p>This confirmed Li Changzhe's idea. Essentially, whether one can enter the teahouse is determined by a test of strength.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Jing Heqiu also rushed to the scene with Wang Ling. The two of them stood on the eaves of a house and looked at everything in front of them quietly. Wang Ling was eating crispy noodles. While watching the people in front of them working extremely hard to score goals.</p>

    <p>"Brother Wang."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu spoke.</p>

    <p>Yes. He called Wang Ling brother directly. The expression on his face was that he was about to cry without tears.</p>

    <p>Originally, entering the Suzaku Gate was actually a test. But when he took Wang Ling to the door, he found that it was too late. And Wang Ling also seemed to have not taken action.</p>

    <p>In order not to waste time, he had no choice but to use the authority belt Wang Ling to directly cross the Suzaku Gate.</p>

    <p>He was really convinced by Wang Ling... and he was so convinced that he couldn't find a reason. The sad look of Brother Wang had already shown how helpless Jing Heqiu was at this time.</p>

    <p>He is the dean of Jingmi Academy. He has never seen such an incredible genius. Now he is coaxing people to participate in the competition like a child... When word spreads, where will his old face go!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed while chewing the noodles. He felt that this group of people was also very strange.</p>

    <p>Since you invited yourself to the teahouse, you also sealed the door of the teahouse with secret techniques. If you don't have enough strength, you won't be allowed in. What's the difference between this behavior and taking off your pants and farting?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling stood on the eaves and looked at the people below working hard to show off their magical powers. He also felt a little helpless in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Brother Wang, I helped you pass the Suzaku Gate. How about you participate in this operation?" Jing Heqiu was about to cry. Wang Ling still refused to participate, which made him very anxious.</p>

    <p>"Break·door·action·move?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>It turns out that there is no need to ensure that the teahouse door is intact. You can even break it...</p>

    <p>Okay. He got it.</p>
