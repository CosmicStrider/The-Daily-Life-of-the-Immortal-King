  <h1>Chapter 1458 The strange Shura field expands</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When he heard the words "Marshal Jiang", Jiang Xiaoche suddenly felt the hairs on his back stand up.</p>

    <p>What is the identity of the Tenth General? It is impossible for him to not know.</p>

    <p>The Huaguo Shuilian Group, represented by Mr. Boss Sun, has contacts with the top ten generals.</p>

    <p>These are all founding fathers and veteran generals covered with honors. Naturally, the benefits they receive are also different.</p>

    <p>Those elixirs that are helpful for spiritual practice, nourishing spiritual roots, consolidating realms and various health-preserving medicines will be produced by the group every month. They will be made into exclusive gift boxes and sent to the homes of each of the ten generals.</p>

    <p>A few times. Birthdays of some of them.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche remembered that he personally sent extra birthday gifts on behalf of Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although Jiang Xiaoche has not been able to meet all the ten generals in person, several of them have actually met him due to work.</p>

    <p>And what a coincidence... Jiang Xiaoche happened to know Marshal Jiang!</p>

    <p>If this Martial Saint saw him seducing his granddaughter... Jiang Xiaoche felt that he would be given a direct warning and disabled on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Brother Che's face doesn't look very good?" Jiang Yingying saw Jiang Xiaoche's expression suddenly changed dramatically. Suddenly she realized that she had just revealed her grandfather's true identity a little too rashly.</p>

    <p>This probably scared Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>But Jiang Yingying himself doesn't think this is too strange.</p>

    <p>In terms of realm and combat power. The ten generals are like younger brothers to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But in terms of reputation, in the minds of many local cultivators in Huaxiu Country, the old generals are all aloof figures like gods.</p>

    <p>Everyone has a completely different bloody story about the bloody battles they fought on the battlefield, which is widely circulated among the people.</p>

    <p>Although among the ten generals, some have retired.</p>

    <p>But the majesty is still there.</p>

    <p>"Actually, Brother Che doesn't need to be too scared. My grandfather just looks scary. In fact, he is quite approachable..." Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>"So you came out to see me at night these past few days. The old marshal didn't ask anything?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I asked." Jiang Yingying said: "I said I came here to consolidate my studies. There is a teacher named Jiang who helps me attend classes on a voluntary basis."</p>

    <p>A top student would go out late at night to consolidate his studies. This sounds outrageous.</p>

    <p>However, the girl has always been well-behaved and obedient. Naturally, Marshal Jiang did not ask too deeply.</p>

    <p>It can be said that these few days are the craziest days that Jiang Yingying has experienced in his life...</p>

    <p>However, after hearing Jiang Yingying's words, Jiang Xiaoche felt that he was about to have a myocardial infarction: "You won't show my photo to the old marshal..."</p>

    <p>This is what worries him most.</p>

    <p>What if the girl in front of him is a heartless person? I'm afraid the old marshal will recognize his face at once.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, if the gang is exposed, the old marshal will probably come directly to kill him...</p>

    <p>At the level of the old marshal, he would kill himself. With his meager health, he would definitely not be able to withstand a punch.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the girl gave him a calm answer: "Of course not... I'm not that stupid. If I post the photos, according to my grandfather's habit, he might go to investigate directly. Then he will know, Brother Che In fact, he's not a teacher at all, but a detective."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>While listening to what Jiang Yingying said, Jiang Xiaoche's forehead was also sweating.</p>

    <p>Because this is really too dangerous...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche felt that his contact with Jiang Yingying in the past few days was like walking back and forth on the verge of committing suicide.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he restrained himself. He didn't arrange a hotel room for Jiang Yingying to talk... but chose to have a conversation in a public area like a restaurant.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Marshal Jiang is very likely to directly check things like room opening records.</p>

    <p>Even if he says he didn't do anything, the old marshal probably won't believe it...</p>

    <p>"Today... that's all... the food on the table. You can eat it if you want..." After saying that, Jiang Xiaoche stood up. He never stopped wiping his sweat.</p>

    <p>Compared to picking up girls, Jiang Xiaoche actually cherishes his life more.</p>

    <p>He was really afraid of the majesty of the old marshal. He must have thought of cutting off the relationship with the girl.</p>

    <p>"Is this over? What about going to the ancient street tomorrow to pretend to be a couple?" Jiang Yingying was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>"Couple, there's no need... The agreement we agreed on before to pretend to be a couple is invalid. Just pretend everything never happened..." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>He was secretly glad in his heart.</p>

    <p>It's okay. So far... nothing has happened...</p>

    <p>"Why? Because my grandfather is Marshal Jiang?"</p>

    <p>"The reasons here are very complicated... Maybe you think it's okay, but for me, it's very dangerous. And I... forget it. I don't mind mentioning these." Jiang Xiaoche looked at the girl in front of him and shook his head gently. Shaking his head. He hesitated to speak.</p>

    <p>He wanted to confess to the girl that he had deceived her. He was not a detective at all.</p>

    <p>He only has himself to blame for this.</p>

    <p>I was careless for a moment and failed to find out the details of the girl earlier.</p>

    <p>He has deceived many people with his eloquent tongue. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is an old liar.</p>

    <p>But now when he saw the disappointed look on Jiang Yingying's face, he actually had the idea of confessing in his heart.</p>

    <p>If...</p>

    <p>If there is a chance to meet next time.</p>

    <p>Maybe he would tell the truth to the girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>But now, since we have decided to cut off the relationship, we might as well not mention this matter...</p>

    <p>"You were the first to bring this up! If you don't go, I will go myself!"</p>

    <p>Seeing Jiang Xiaoche about to leave, Jiang Yingying's stubbornness came back: "You don't want to help me. There are many people who are willing to help me!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche smiled: "Who else can help you? Then I wish him good luck..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying stomped her feet angrily: "You coward! You are not worthy of classmate Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>"Whatever you say." Jiang Xiaoche shrugged, took his suit jacket off the hanger, and left the private room.</p>

    <p>To be honest, at this time, his mind was in chaos and he felt very melancholy.</p>

    <p>With the girl's stubborn temper, since she has decided to make a plan, there is really nothing to stop her from continuing to implement it...</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if he doesn't go, Jiang Yingying may indeed find someone else to take his place.</p>

    <p>But this plan was proposed by Jiang Xiaoche himself.</p>

    <p>If something unexpected happened to Jiang Yingying, Jiang Xiaoche felt that he was definitely to blame.</p>

    <p>Even though he had already told the girl about interrupting the plan.</p>

    <p>But now, with his thoughts in confusion, he still couldn't help but worry about the girl's actions tomorrow...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in Jiugong's villa, Jiugong Liangzi also received a message.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Are you going to Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street tomorrow?" Jiugong Liangzi held his chin in his hands, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss. There are four other classmates." The female bodyguard said at the side.</p>

    <p>"It should just be for fun. I have no interest in this young lady. Send someone to follow her and see what she is doing. Take more photos. If any ugly photos are taken, immediately, immediately. Send it to me!" Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Miss."</p>

    <p>The female bodyguard wiped her sweat and replied.</p>

    <p>Tracking is actually not difficult. It may be a little difficult to take ugly photos... After all, Miss Sun is a 360° beauty with no blind spots...</p>

    <p>Although I had only glanced at it through the crack in the door of the student union office before, the female bodyguard was shocked and amazed.</p>

    <p>At this time, the female bodyguard sighed silently in her heart. Then she began to reply to the second message she received: "In addition, there is another message. It seems that Zhuo Yi is also going."</p>

    <p>"What is he going to do?" Jiugong Liangzi was curious.</p>

    <p>"Well... I'm not sure..." the female bodyguard said, "So, are you going to go now? If so, I'll tell the driver to be on call tomorrow."</p>

    <p>"No need."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi shook his head. He snorted ╭(╯^╰)╮: "I, Jiugong Liangzi. How could I waste so much time on an old liar!"</p>
