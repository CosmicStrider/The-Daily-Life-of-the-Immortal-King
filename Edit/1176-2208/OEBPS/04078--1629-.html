  <h1>Chapter 1629 Fengchu Encirclement and Suppression Battle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Meanwhile. On the Island of the Sun.</p>

    <p>Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Since the last Sun Island exchange program between Number 60 High School and Jiudaohe High School was successfully completed.</p>

    <p>Today, the Jiugong family has annexed the "Zhai Xing Group", the largest gangster on Sun Island. And the Huaguo Shuilian Group is conducting in-depth strategic cooperation behind the scenes. It can be said that it is truly at its peak.</p>

    <p>In the main hall of the Jiugong family. The news that Sun Rong was captured by Fengchu also reached here at the same time.</p>

    <p>The owner Jiugong Akagi was furious: "What? The Sun Rong girl was captured? This is really unreasonable! What is the origin of that Mrs. Fengchu? She is simply eating the heart of a bear and the courage of a leopard."</p>

    <p>"Father, calm down."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi said: "According to the information currently collected by our Jiugong family and the Gray Cult branch of Sun Island, this Mrs. Fengchu is an underground scientist who has been targeted by the International Cultivator Alliance for a long time. She is engaged in inhumanity and violates human ethics. He is very famous in the underground science community for his scientific experiments."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Akagi frowned slightly when he heard this. He felt like he had heard about this somewhere.</p>

    <p>"Father, Huaxiu Alliance has now dispatched personnel from the Office of Strategic Deception. This matter... I think even if we don't take action..."</p>

    <p>"But we... have to take action."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Akagi said: "Now our Jiugong family has a close cooperative relationship with the Sun family. Although, this time our Jiugong family did not receive a support message from the Office of Strategic Deception. But how do you know that this is not a test?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi heard this and suddenly realized: "What does father mean? The Office of Strategic Deception deliberately did not post to us?"</p>

    <p>"It's very possible." Jiugong Akagi nodded and said, "Given the relationship between the Office of Strategic Deception and the Sun family, we should also know that our Jiugong family has already established cooperation with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. So this time, it's more like It is a temptation to test our attitude."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Jiugong Akagi couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>In fact, even if he doesn't test it, he will take action...</p>

    <p>You should know that he, the head of the Jiugong family, has joined Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Now the leader is in trouble.</p>

    <p>He is a believer.</p>

    <p>Is there any reason not to save him?</p>

    <p>But if we send someone from Sun Island now, it might be too late.</p>

    <p>It's too late to go there. I can't keep up with the warm show of loyalty.</p>

    <p>"Yingxian Heming." Jiugong Akagi shouted the name of the Jiugong family's butler.</p>

    <p>Upon hearing this, Yingxian Heming immediately stepped forward and said, "My subordinate is here."</p>

    <p>"Notify us. Use all the contacts our Jiugong family can use in Huaxiu." Jiugong Akagi said.</p>

    <p>In order to expand Jiugong's business in Huaxiu, Jiugong has actually been deployed in Huaxiu for many years.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming, as the chief steward, naturally knows this.</p>

    <p>It was just this scale. He was worried that it might not be strong enough.</p>

    <p>"I know what you're thinking. Are you worried about the limited connections we can find?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Akagi sat cross-legged on the tatami and said: "When senior Li Xian came to our place as a guest, he said that he had been entrusted by Mr. Jin Deng to update the {Ghost Book} of my Jiugong family. Changed. The seal was re-strengthened. Another talisman was given outside the order. As long as you hold this talisman, you can freely control all the evil spirits included in the {Ghost Book}."</p>

    <p>"Is there such a thing?"</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming and Jiugong Xiushi looked at each other. They had no idea about this matter.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Akagi suddenly laughed: "Who said that the only people who can come to rescue are cultivators? Now we can freely control the ghosts included in the {Ghost Book}."</p>

    <p>"The head of the family means..." Yingxian Heming was stunned.</p>

    <p>"You let Liangzi go over and set an example for our Jiugong family." Jiugong Akagi said.</p>

    <p>When the people from Number 60 High School left the island, I...</p>

    <p>He had entrusted Li Xian to deliver this ghost talisman to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <p>Because of their transnational connections, the Jiugong family's living connections in Huaxiu are indeed limited.</p>

    <p>Especially in a battle of this magnitude.</p>

    <p>It may be just an inconspicuous drop in the ocean. But if you can call upon those who have died, it will be completely different...</p>

    <p>That Mrs. Fengchu would never have thought of it.</p>

    <p>This time the people came to surround and suppress him.</p>

    <p>There are not only living cultivators gathered by various forces.</p>

    <p>Also represented by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>The 100,000 shadowy soldiers were sent...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To be honest, when Keorn joined the 1225 temporary command group, he was also shocked by the large number of people in the group.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, so many heaven-level people were gathered, and the heads of earth-level sects came to rush for help. This was something Keorn never expected. And he would actually command these people to fight next.</p>

    <p>"It seems that a lot of people have gathered. Zhenjun's reputation in the circle is indeed very high." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord looked at the scene calmly and said with a smile: "How about it, Mr. Keorn, can you handle it?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Keorn was standing in front of the podium. His whole body was trembling. It was not that he felt fear, but that he felt excited... He had not felt this kind of passionate feeling for a long time.</p>

    <p>War. is an art!</p>

    <p>As the commander of this battle, Lord Diulei fully trusted him. And he naturally had to do his best.</p>

    <p>After a while.</p>

    <p>Keorn finally took a deep breath and let out a powerful voice. It was accurately conveyed to everyone's mind by the core sound output system inside the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Everyone involved in the "Fengchu Encirclement and Suppression War" can hear Keorn's voice.</p>

    <p>"Everyone! This is Keorn, the commander-in-chief of this Fengchu siege. It's an honor to fight alongside you all this time!"</p>

    <p>"The target we want to encircle and suppress this time is the underground scientist who has been wanted for a long time. Mrs. Fengchu."</p>

    <p>"Huaxiu Alliance has been targeting her for a long time. But this time, because the girl Sun Rong was kidnapped, they had no choice but to close the network in advance."</p>

    <p>"In this siege, your mission is to rescue Miss Sun Rong! Capture all the personnel in the Fengchu laboratory alive, including Mrs. Fengchu! In addition, you need as much assistance as possible to collect information about this Mrs. Fengchu. Evidence of guilt!"</p>

    <p>"This time. This siege! There is no feint attack! All the leaders participating in this operation are the main attackers!"</p>

    <p>"Every master, please arrive at the agreed upon location and act in accordance with the instructions from our headquarters!"</p>

    <p>"I wish you all good luck and immortality!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Er Ha temporarily returned to the top of the Holy Pillar of the Demon Realm through the power of Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>The Holy Envoy Shen Wuyue seems to have guessed that Er Ha was coming. He has been waiting here for a long time. He hooked his lips: "Now that you are a Divine Beast. Why do you need our help?"</p>

    <p>"Ahem. Even for a Divine Beast. We still have to keep a low profile. And even if I've been elevated to the status of a Divine Beast. I still care about the construction of my home town." Er Ha said, "What. You won't help?"</p>

    <p>"No. Lord Second Generation Demon Saint and I are naturally willing to help with this favor." Shen Wuyue shook his head. He said, "Now that the Demon Realm and the Human Realm have turned their differences into peace. In the future, we will work together to seek development and cooperation. This is indeed a great opportunity to show our attitude. Of course. The key is to look at Ling Zhenren's face."</p>

    <p>"interesting."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "So. How many people can the demon world send?"</p>

    <p>"As much as you want. As much as you want."</p>

    <p>At this time, Shen Wuyue held the magic ball and threw the demon holy magic ball into the air.</p>

    <p>A gorgeous map of the demon world appeared before Er Ha's eyes.</p>

    <p>He looked at Er Ha and said: "The demon world. Ninety-six outer realms, eight middle realms, four inner realms. A total of one hundred and eight demons in the realm. They are ready and waiting to be dispatched."</p>

    <p>"You're so big for fun?" Er Ha was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Don't you just like big ones?" Shen Wuyue laughed: "Oh, by the way. Let me tell you one more thing."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "I have joined Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>
