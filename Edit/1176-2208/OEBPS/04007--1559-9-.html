  <h1>Chapter 1559 Jiudaohe will never give in!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Office. A middle-aged man with a head so smooth that it can reflect reflected light said.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a crisp suit. On his chest was the exclusive badge of the Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Office. His mustache and unilateral glasses highlighted the man's elite temperament.</p>

    <p>There is a man's business card box on his desk. The words "Ueki Kimisan" are written on it.</p>

    <p>"I made a miscalculation. I didn't expect these kids from Number 60 High School to be so capable," Ueki Kimisan said.</p>

    <p>He is the director of the Academic Affairs Office of Jiudaohe. Jiudaohe does not have the position of vice principal. In addition to the principal, he is the overall administrator of the school.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe has implemented the grading system for so many years and has never made any mistakes. And the support of the school board for the grading system is unimaginable.</p>

    <p>But Ueki Kimisan didn't expect that this time it would be broken by a few foreign exchange students.</p>

    <p>"Do you think the warning letter is useful?" In the office, a blond foreign man held a red wine glass and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Holland. I know exactly who has the final say in the board of directors. I won't delay for too long. It's just a literary exchange organization established by students. There's no need to overturn it." Ueki Kimisan said with a confident smile.</p>

    <p>"What is the origin of that Houlang Sang? I think this young man is very extraordinary." Neo Holland asked.</p>

    <p>"I think Mr. Holland thinks too much. In my personal opinion, that Houlang Sang is probably just a chess piece." Ueki Kimisan frowned.</p>

    <p>"So it's... a chess piece?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it's a chess piece."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan said: "The real organizer behind the scenes is the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Sun Rong. Apart from her, who else has the courage to directly donate the pot of purple cherry blossoms."</p>

    <p>"Do you think she planned it all?"</p>

    <p>"Only this eldest lady dares to do that. It must be her. She borrowed the name of Houlang Sang to set up an organization. This made the organization appear to be an exchange and support group for literature lovers. But in fact, it has an ulterior motive. The purpose of man."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But the eldest lady has an unusual background. Jiudaohe can't openly take action with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. So now there is no way. We can only erase the Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>To be honest. Holland feels that what Ueki Kimisan said is actually not completely unreasonable.</p>

    <p>However, he always had a feeling. He felt that Ueki Kimisan thought Wang Ling too simply...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Holland, don't worry. I have issued a warning. In addition, I will also plan to make our team lose in this closed-door competition for the national college student rankings."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan said: "Just let that Houlang Sang lose the game. Everything will fall apart."</p>

    <p>"I think Mr. Ueki is a little too confident." Holland frowned.</p>

    <p>"I dare to guarantee it in the name of the Lord."</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan said: "No! I guarantee in the name of Dao Ancestor! This matter will be resolved smoothly!"</p>

    <p>In the name of Dao Ancestor?</p>

    <p>Although there are differences in the beliefs of cultivation between the Eastern cultivation world and the Western cultivation world.</p>

    <p>But "Dao Ancestor." This seems to be the biggest god believed in in the Eastern cultivation world.</p>

    <p>Holland sighed: "Okay. Since Mr. Ueki is so confident, then I will tentatively believe that Mr. Ueki can handle this matter completely. The actual control of Jiudaohe must be firmly in our hands."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Mr. Holland." Ueki Kimisan nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, the two of them hugged each other and saluted.</p>

    <p>Ueki Kimisan: "Jiudaohe! Never give in! Dao Ancestor protects you. Everything will be safe and sound!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the student union office.</p>

    <p>Jisaki placed the old warning letter that he had rubbed on the table.</p>

    <p>He dug this out of the trash can...</p>

    <p>The main thing is to check on the reinforcements he invited.</p>

    <p>And this "reinforcement" is none other than Zhou Xiang, the Chinese teacher who worked with Ma Jiao to restore Jiudaohe's secret room.</p>

    <p>"Jisaki-san... I'm afraid you won't be able to talk to me if you ask me for help with this matter."</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang glanced at the warning letter in hand. He couldn't help but sigh: "Jiudaohe has always been xenophobic. And I am a foreign teacher, so I don't have much say. I can get a high salary here simply because of my outstanding teaching ability."</p>

    <p>Jisaki crossed his fingers and held his chin: "I asked Teacher Zhou Xiang to come here. Of course I don't want Teacher Zhou to speak for me. Asking the Academic Affairs Office to revoke the warning letter. This is a fantasy."</p>

    <p>After Zhou Xiang heard this, he laughed on the spot: "So it's not for this reason."</p>

    <p>"I know Teacher Zhou's life at school is actually not easy," Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"Um..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang nodded. Then he said: "A warning letter is a very serious punishment. You actually have a relationship with Zhai Xing Group. It's just the Academic Affairs Department. They don't dare to issue a warning letter like this. So I don't take this matter seriously." It's probably the school board's decision."</p>

    <p>"The board of directors. It's really troublesome."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao also frowned after hearing this.</p>

    <p>Things are starting to get troublesome...</p>

    <p>"I remember that Jiudaohe is not a school run by the Jiugong family. The board of directors should be able to handle it better. And my aunt is the sixth wife of the Jiugong family." Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"You don't know something. Jiudaohe school is actually a property under the name of the third wife of the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang said: "The third wife has always wanted to be a principal because of her low educational level. The old man of the Jiugong family helped her open Jiudaohe in order to pursue her."</p>

    <p>"But the third wife has no management experience at all. So she hired some foreign management teams to help manage it."</p>

    <p>"Then over time, the actual controlling stake in Jiudaohe's board of directors was controlled by those foreign investment teams."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>These words made Jisaki think.</p>

    <p>It sounds like the situation is much worse than it actually is...</p>

    <p>But now for Jisaki, there is no way out.</p>

    <p>"Even if it is a hard nut to crack, this is an agreement between me and Houlang Sang, Rong Jiang. The Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch must exist! Jiudaohe's grading system must also be cancelled!" Jisaki said firmly.</p>

    <p>"But it's useless for you to tell me this." Zhou Xiang spread his hands helplessly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jisaki suddenly asked: "Teacher Zhou can't talk to each other in the Academic Affairs Office. What about other teachers?"</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Xiang touched his chin: "My popularity is actually pretty good. There are many foreign teachers in Jiudaohe. I actually have a pretty good relationship with the foreign teachers."</p>

    <p>"That's ok!" Jisaki became excited.</p>

    <p>"What?" Zhou Xiang was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Join the Gray Cult! Teacher Zhou. You will be our ambassador. Let's recruit all these teachers into Gray Cult!"</p>

    <p>"This..." Zhou Xiang was stunned: "This matter... I'm afraid I can't handle it."</p>

    <p>"I have an offer that Teacher Zhou can't refuse."</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked at Zhou Xiang seriously: "Classmate Zhou Ziyi! His leg! Rong Jiang said it can be cured!"</p>
