  <h1>Chapter 1654 Secret observation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the blank feeling came up in his mind, Hei Long felt that a small light point suddenly appeared in the endless dark world deep in his heart. It was as if something was about to wake up from his body, giving him a splitting headache.</p>

    <p>Almost suddenly, the pain felt like his brain was being torn apart, making him hold his head and roll on the ground in pain. He kept roaring.</p>

    <p>In the spectator stands, Hei Long's unusual reaction also made the silent scene become boiling again.</p>

    <p>No one knew what exactly happened. Hei Long was seen holding his head and his limbs were twitching like maggots.</p>

    <p>"Hei Long! Stand up! Do you know how much money I spent?" Zhu Yuanrun roared. He stood in the audience and cursed.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Hei Long could no longer hear any other sounds.</p>

    <p>He only has one question, and that is to know who he is...</p>

    <p>Why on earth did he appear in this world?</p>

    <p>All this time, he has only been carrying out the tasks assigned to him by a few fixed "commanders." He has no intention of getting to the bottom of things to find out his true identity.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Hei Long felt that he seemed...faintly changed.</p>

    <p>Facing Zhu Yuanrun's scolding, the pupils that had transformed into normal human beings shrank severely at this moment. Then, suppressing the pain of his brain breaking, he jumped down from the ring.</p>

    <p>This move shocked Zhu Yuanrun and the entire audience.</p>

    <p>"Hei Long! You madman! Taking the initiative to jump off the ring is an act of abstention!" Zhu Yuanrun was furious. He never thought that Hei Long would disobey his order!</p>

    <p>This is the thug he hired from "that adult!"</p>

    <p>All parts and components are of the highest quality!</p>

    <p>The monthly fee is astronomical!</p>

    <p>But "Hei Long" can't be used. As long as Hei Long plays, it means victory. It's true that Zhu Yuanrun spent a lot of money. But Hei Long made more money for him in the boxing ring by accurately handling boxing.</p>

    <p>At this time, Hei Long walked up to Zhu Yuanrun with an expressionless face. He grabbed his neck and lifted him up high: "Tell me...who am I..."</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun was choked by Hei Long and couldn't breathe. His limbs twitched and struggled. He used the spiritual power in his body to the extreme in an attempt to break Hei Long's fingers apart. However, Hei Long's strength was too strong. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't. Not moving at all.</p>

    <p>"Save...save me..." Zhu Yuanrun felt like he was going to die.</p>

    <p>He never thought that the Hei Long he bought from "that adult" for so much money would betray him!</p>

    <p>Obviously he just renewed his subscription two days ago!</p>

    <p>Obviously now he has the highest authority to command Hei Long!</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>Just when Hei Long was about to die, Jin Deng, who had taken advantage of Jiugong Liangzi's body, suddenly took action. A bit of Buddha's light shot out from her fingertips and accurately hit the back of Hei Long's hand.</p>

    <p>Hei Long was in pain. Zhu Yuanrun had to be separated.</p>

    <p>Then he stepped on his feet and turned into a cannonball, which directly punched a big hole in the ceiling and escaped from the underground boxing ring.</p>

    <p>This "Gong" is really in the way!</p>

    <p>And his "commander" is not only Zhu Yuanrun...</p>

    <p>Someone must know the answer he wants.</p>

    <p>"Ahem! Damn...damn Hei Long!" Zhu Yuanrun was like a lost dog. He lay on the ground and coughed for a long time before he stood up tremblingly from the ground.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhu, are you okay... Hei Long is going crazy. What should we do now?" At the moment when Hei Long went crazy, several boys who had been hiding away gathered around him again.</p>

    <p>"What should I do? Put him on a wanted list for me! How dare you do this to me..." Zhu Yuanrun rubbed his neck that was red from being pinched. His expression was still painful.</p>

    <p>"Okay Mr. Zhu..."</p>

    <p>The boy replied: "There is one more thing, Mr. Zhu..."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"That...Mr. Hu Baoguo... ran away."</p>

    <p>"Run away?" Zhu Yuanrun was so angry that he almost fainted. He almost couldn't stand still.</p>

    <p>This result can actually be said to be unexpected, but within reason.</p>

    <p>Hei Long's combat power is already superior to Hu Baoguo's.</p>

    <p>Even Hei Long was beaten. With Hu Baoguo's self-protective personality... he definitely would not continue the next game.</p>

    <p>But then...</p>

    <p>The outcome of this Martial Arts Competition is already clear...</p>

    <p>He lost too completely.</p>

    <p>In the end, Hei Long and Hu Baoguo, one turned against the other and ran away... so that he didn't even have a chance to operate behind the scenes!</p>

    <p>Why is he so unlucky this year? So many unexpected things happened...</p>

    <p>This year's class is really the worst class he has ever led!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhu...then now..."</p>

    <p>"Announce it." Zhu Yuanrun slumped on the ground. Although he likes to engage in black-box manipulation and control the situation of the game, but now he has reached this juncture. When all roads have been blocked, the situation before him is The only way is to admit defeat.</p>

    <p>Although he will lose a lot of money, Zhu Yuanrun is not completely unable to afford the loss.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>There is actually another very important reason why Zhu Yuanrun is willing to admit defeat like this.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi just took action and saved his life from Hei Long.</p>

    <p>"After the results are announced, call Mr. Gong, Ducas, and his companions to my office." Zhu Yuanrun rubbed his sore temples, waved his sleeves, and left the scene surrounded by everyone.</p>

    <p>Until the bunny girl arranged by Zhu Yuanrun came on stage and announced that the winner was "Gong." Zhuo Yi couldn't believe it: "He just gave up like that?"</p>

    <p>"All the roads are blocked. What else can you do if you don't admit defeat?" Qin Zhong laughed: "I thought he'd deny it. I didn't realize he was such a fast talker. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Ms. Liangzi just saved his life?"</p>

    <p>"But what happened to Hei Long? I feel like he has changed." Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the stability of the New Ancient Divine Weapons is a little bit worse. The purifying Buddha's light just now made him think about life."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "As a collection of highly intelligent life forms created by humans, theoretically speaking, it is not impossible for these intelligent life forms to develop self-awareness."</p>

    <p>Things are becoming more and more interesting in Wang Ming's opinion.</p>

    <p>"Pay according to the odds. We can get a total of 60 million in funds." At this time, Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"I think. Let's go and find the Zhenjen and reconcile together."</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun is here too?"</p>

    <p>"Here he is. And he came with Er Ha." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Relying on his brain waves, sensing the bands of these familiar people is already an extremely familiar operation for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is that except Lord Diulei and Er Ha...</p>

    <p>He seemed to have sensed some very subtle, specious fluctuations.</p>

    <p>Kind of like Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But it's a little bit different.</p>

    <p>"This guy..." After another simple detection, Wang Ming couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>

    <p>If he guessed correctly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling probably didn't come to this world in person...</p>

    <p>But looking at the screen...</p>

    <p>As expected of Ling Ling.</p>

    <p>They are all separated by a space. They can all take a peek.</p>

    <p>Are today's screen-peeping techniques powerful enough to be used across screens...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Liangzi and others were led to Zhu Yuanrun's office. After a short wait, several boys following Zhu Yuanrun arrived at the scene carrying a lot of cash. There were as many as ten suitcases. !</p>

    <p>Because it is a shady business, most of the transactions in the underground boxing ring involve cash flow.</p>

    <p>Ducas tapped the number. After confirming that it was correct, he nodded with satisfaction: "I didn't expect Mr. Zhu to actually keep his promise. It's a bit beyond my expectation. I thought this old guy would do Tai Chi with me."</p>

    <p>"Ducas. You have gone too far. You speak ill of people behind their backs. Am I, Zhu Yuanrun, such a shameless person?" At this time, Zhu Yuanrun walked in from the door. He was wearing a suit and leather shoes, looking like an old capitalist.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, he bowed to Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi, Jin Deng: "Thank you Mr. Gong. Thank you three. If it hadn't been for you just now, I'm afraid I would have died in the hands of Hei Long."</p>

    <p>Ducas smiled: "Mr. Zhu, besides the bonus, you seem to have given me one less thing."</p>

    <p>"I know what you're talking about. I've already prepared it."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Zhu Yuanrun took out four seven-color crystal cards from his arms: "This is the pass for you."</p>

    <p>"How come there are four pictures?" Ducas' eyes widened when he saw it.</p>

    <p>Four passes!</p>

    <p>The price of this one is worth 20 million gold gear coins!</p>

    <p>This is wealth that people in slums cannot accumulate in a lifetime!</p>

    <p>"One of them is for you. The other three are for Mr. Gong and his friends." Zhu Yuanrun said generously.</p>

    <p>He has acquaintances in the core area. So although these four passes cost some money, they are actually not as expensive as the market value.</p>

    <p>"Is it conditional?" Jiugong Liangzi asked in a changed voice.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Gong is smart."</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun said seriously: "Actually, it's not too much of a condition. I hope Mr. Gong can help me stop Hei Long. This guy has gone crazy. I guess his next move will be to find other commanders... They have a deep cooperative relationship with my boxing ring. If I let them die like that, it will be very troublesome."</p>
