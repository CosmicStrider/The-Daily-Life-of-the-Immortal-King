  <h1>Chapter 1861 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The trade star of the Central Region in the Eternal Era actually refers to an entire galaxy. It is also the only rare pure land without power disputes. Cultivators from the forces belonging to the four major regions can conduct free trade here by their own means.</p>

    <p>There are all kinds of people from all three religions and nine schools. It is a lively area.</p>

    <p>There are one hundred and eight stars in the entire trade galaxy. The upcoming gathering of the Four Emperors will focus on the "Trade Central Star."</p>

    <p>According to common sense, the emperor's travels were extremely grand. The mythical beast chariot composed of twelve carefully selected mythical beasts was almost the standard equipment for the emperor's travels.</p>

    <p>But this time, Dongda didn't know if it was to cater to Wang Ling's consistent style. He did the opposite.</p>

    <p>Wearing only casual clothes, they went into action.</p>

    <p>The only people he brought with him were the three people who were in the main hall before.</p>

    <p>There appear to be four people here, but they are actually eight... After all, there is one living in each person's body.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of Emperor Dongda, it actually doesn't matter whether other people go or not. As long as the "great god" in his body doesn't leave.</p>

    <p>So even though he went on patrol incognito, Emperor Dongda himself had a lot of confidence because of his ability to "invite gods."</p>

    <p>In previous years, the Eastern Region would send out many people to serve at the Four Emperors' Gatherings. Among them were all kinds of geniuses sent to the palace by the Eastern Region royal family for training.</p>

    <p>And in such a bustling place, it is common for the four regions to poach each other.</p>

    <p>Therefore, often after a meeting of the Four Emperors, the people who attended the meeting and the number of people brought there are often different. Even the people brought back will change.</p>

    <p>The four regions usually look peaceful and indifferent, but privately they are always fighting a war to plunder talents.</p>

    <p>Like this rare confrontation between the Eastern Region and the Western Region, it was also launched based on the war of plundering talents.</p>

    <p>If the Sun Goddess hadn't taken refuge with the Western Emperor and willingly became a pawn in the hands of the Western Emperor, he would be afraid the Eastern Emperor wouldn't have been so passive in the early stages of the battle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually saw it.</p>

    <p>In fact, the four regions and four emperors are still in a situation of mutual checks and balances.</p>

    <p>Take this time for example, the battle between the Eastern Region and the Western Region.</p>

    <p>Although the Western Emperor gave the Sun Goddess power, she actually did not go to the battlefield to fight in the end.</p>

    <p>Even his purpose is only to support the Sun Goddess to ascend to power, rather than directly annexing the Eastern Territory and trying to become the emperor of the Eastern and Western Territories.</p>

    <p>It just happens to illustrate the sensitivity of these eternal emperors to the Great Emperor's War.</p>

    <p>The snipe and the clam compete for the fisherman's profit.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, any domain has actual necessity. And once this check and balance is broken, what will usher in will be an eternal war of cultivators facing the four domains.</p>

    <p>The Trade Central Star is filled with ancient cities built from ancient bricks and stone. It is just like the scene that Wang Ling once imagined.</p>

    <p>If these buildings were placed in modern times, they would be extremely magnificent relics of ancient cultivators. However, such a scale Wang Ling is indeed rare to see in modern cultivator life.</p>

    <p>Even the ruins of the sacred beast King Rakshasa that they visited earlier were just a drop in the bucket compared to the eternal world.</p>

    <p>After entering the Trade Central Star, Sun Rong saw some ancient city guards wearing silver armor flying in the air holding various magic weapons. Their expressions were alert and their eyes were sharp. Flying in the air gave people a great sense of majesty, and a sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>"Didn't you say that the Central Territory does not belong to any force?" Sun Rong was curious and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun doesn't know something. These ancient city guards were selected by the emperors of the four regions to guard this place. They are found in all galaxies in the central region. And every ancient city guard is of royal blood."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui introduced: "According to the Four Regions Trade Agreement, the royal families in the Central Region will personally select their own elites and send them here every ten years for rotation."</p>

    <p>"This is also a kind of experience. Once the rotation period is over and you return, these members of the royal family and their families will be rewarded by the emperor. That is a benefit that is difficult to explain in words."</p>

    <p>These words made Emperor Dongda laugh on the spot: "It seems that you have visited the homes of these royal families."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhang Zhui admitted generously without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>"You are very generous." Wang Ying couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>"It's all old news. Is there anything to mention? Besides, I, Zhang Zhui, have always only taken money. I have never done anything to make money or even kill someone based on my realm."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "Don't look at the peace in the Central Territory. That's because there are these ancient cities guarding it. If you get a treasure in the Central Territory, you will be in danger after leaving the Central Territory. You may be targeted."</p>

    <p>"You mean killing people and selling goods?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhang Zhui nodded and said: "The ancient times did not have such sound laws as the modern world of cultivation. There are too many unruly people. One earth can still be governed. But the galaxies are so big. There are always places that cannot be restrained. And these lawless places are places where all kinds of evil breed."</p>

    <p>Several people used "team chat" to discuss the matter generously.</p>

    <p>In fact, after hearing what Zhang Zhui said Wang Ling, he suddenly became curious about one thing.</p>

    <p>That is when they come to attend the gathering of the Four Emperors this time. Will they directly run into Zhang Zhui and Li Xian from the Eternal Era...</p>

    <p>After all, they had not yet been imprisoned in the Corpse Map by Dao Ancestor Wang during this period.</p>

    <p>The gathering of the Four Emperors is a big event. There are many cultivators from all walks of life who come to watch. At the same time, it will also greatly increase the total transaction volume of the trading galaxy.</p>

    <p>Once the total trading volume increases, it means that there will be more cultivators who can find treasures.</p>

    <p>These will all become Zhang Zhui's goals.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling thinks it would be very interesting if we bump into the former Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and others settled in a restaurant. To Wang Ling's dismay, the chef in this restaurant did not know how to make crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling took this opportunity to hear some other secrets.</p>

    <p>"Have you heard? The emperor of the Eastern Region showed the supreme light Kongque King Ming's Dharma... It's so terrifying!"</p>

    <p>"This shows that the emperors all have trump cards. It's better not to take the initiative to provoke them. Those who covet the throne are simply seeking death."</p>

    <p>"However, the emperor of the Western Region seems unconvinced. He plans to sell some of the trophies he won in the previous battle with the Emperor of the Eastern Region at this auction. Those are immortal objects in the Imperial Palace of the Eastern Region. They are priceless!"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. The emperors of the Western Regions themselves didn't even expect that the Eastern Emperor hid this trump card. They must be furious. They can only find compensation here."</p>

    <p>"But in my opinion, it's not certain whether this search for compensation can be successful."</p>

    <p>"Brother, what do you say?"</p>

    <p>"It is said that the famous thief Zhang Zhui is about to take action. He said he wants to steal something that the emperor of the Western Regions plans to auction."</p>

    <p>"Is this... really fake?"</p>

    <p>"It's true. The Central Auction House has received the notice letter from Zhang Zhui."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others were all shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>They have already seen "Ye Ren" played by Zhang Zhui. They are already lowering their heads and holding their foreheads. Apparently they are unwilling to face the history of the past.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is surprised. In this eternal time, there is still a bad habit of sending theft warning letters?</p>

    <p>Deliberately notifying others before stealing things... This is too stupid!</p>
