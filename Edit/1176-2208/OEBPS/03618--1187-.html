  <h1>Chapter 1187 Li Huanran</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Is the demon shadow heavy..."</p>

    <p>"An ability that can implant a shadow into the mind and turn it into a psychological shadow area." Jiang Yingyue replied.</p>

    <p>She has fought against Li Huanran, so she clearly understands the tricky nature of this ability.</p>

    <p>The numerous shadows can implant all the shadows within sight into a person's heart, thus forming a fear of the surrounding environment. It is a powerful mental interference type of shadow.</p>

    <p>Such fear goes deep into the heart and bone marrow. People who are mentally frightened cannot escape in a short period of time... Even the use of any Heavenly Dao spell to calm the mind has no effect.</p>

    <p>Is it a mind control image? It sounds really powerful.</p>

    <p>Hearing Jiang Yingyue's description, Er Ha raised his eyebrows slightly. This was the first time he saw this type of photography. The investigation of photography is of great value. This time the three of them were affected by Wang Ling was assigned to deal with the mastermind behind the scenes. But in the process, it is also easy to collect more intelligence information about Shadow.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was a sound of footsteps in the dim stalactite cave. A young man with long black hair slowly walked out of the cave. He was wearing a black slim-fitting suit. A dark red girdle highlighted the young man's slender figure. figure.</p>

    <p>Li Huanran. This name made Er Ha feel familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere.</p>

    <p>"He is the son of the immortal boxing master Li Xiaokai." Xiao Yin said. In addition to the vicious criminals on the dark web who may be resurrected, the list he obtained actually also has a list of decent people. These were all in the past. A powerful and righteous person in the world of cultivation who passed away due to various unexpected reasons over the years.</p>

    <p>As the son of Master Li Xiaokai, Li Huanran is also on this list.</p>

    <p>Ever since the famous martial arts master Mr. Li Xiaokai died after punching through the "Gate of the Void" at his birthday party, his son Li Huanran has also been looking for a way to retrieve Master Li Xiaokai, and eventually took his own life.</p>

    <p>"Li Huanran always believed that his father was not dead. Instead, he was trapped in the world of the Void Gate and could not come back. So he tried his best to reopen the Void Gate and rescue Master Li." Xiao Yin also did a lot of homework during that period of history. Because he was learning to write novels with Father Wang. He needed to collect various character materials, so he almost never forgot the information he had read.</p>

    <p>These materials are all ready-made. It is better than some unprofessional authors who keep writing novels under the pretext of taking materials from outside.</p>

    <p>"Then it seems that Li Huanran failed."</p>

    <p>"Indeed. It is said that Li Huanran failed to forcefully break through the Void Gate. His body was corroded by the spiritual energy of the Void. When he found it, only half of his palm was left."</p>

    <p>At this point, there was a silence in the audience. Wang Zhen felt that he had underestimated the scheming of the people behind the scenes. The other party not only resurrected the villains, but also resurrected some decent masters and used them.</p>

    <p>"Li Huanran is the son of Master Li Xiaokai. He has portrayed justice in his life. But have you seen the look in his eyes? Now he is in a state of losing control." Xiao Yin looked at Li Huanran who was walking slowly from a distance. Only Li Huanran was seen. Ran's eyes were blank. He was in a deeply controlled state. There was no luster in his pupils.</p>

    <p>The son of the famous martial arts master Li Xiaokai. Now after his resurrection, he has become the possessor of powerful Shadow ability. The degree of difficulty is self-evident. The critical moment. Although Li Huanran was once a positive figure, but if he has become an enemy... then The task before Wang Zhen now. There is still only one battle!</p>

    <p>Li Huanran said nothing. He had chosen the target based on his own judgment, and finally focused his eyes on Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>"Choose me to be your opponent." Wang Zhen took the initiative and took a step forward. He could already feel the hostility and murderous intent in Li Huanran's eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen put up his posture and breathed like a blue. If it was a physical skill competition, he felt that he might not be Li Huanran's opponent. In fact, he often fought with Gu Shunzhi when he was in the God's Domain. Although he lost every time, he also concluded. Gained a lot of experience.</p>

    <p>Although Li Huanran is under control.</p>

    <p>However, the professional habits accumulated over the years made Li Huanran almost form a professional habit the moment he saw Wang Zhen showing his boxing stance. His feet trembled, and he took a step back with a heavy weight. His body was as light and soft as if there were no bones. Then he The five fingers of his hands were spread wide. The energy lingering on his fingertips actually made the sound of a dragon roaring.</p>

    <p>"This is the dragon fist that Master Li Xiaokai became famous for back then." Xiao Yin explained at the side.</p>

    <p>"Dragon Fist?" Wang Zhen looked extremely serious.</p>

    <p>Comparing boxing skills with Li Huanran. Wang Zhen didn't know how much advantage he could take. But judging from his photography ability, it seemed that it would be better to use boxing skills to decide the outcome rather than competing with Li Huanran's Shadow ability.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Zhen's fighting strategy. He hopes to find Li Huanran's flaws during the boxing competition.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Li Huanran flashed to the ground and disappeared instantly in front of Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>"So fast!" Wang Zhen held his muscles and tried to use his physical strength to resist. However, Li Huanran moved very fast. His hand transformed into a dragon shape and grabbed Wang Zhen's back. He directly pulled off a layer of leather straps on Wang Zhen's back. He tore off the uniform of Number 60 High School! This is the "claw" skill of Dragon Fist. The power of this claw is shocking.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen had been beaten all kinds of times since he was a child. The injury caused by this claw did not cause him much pain.</p>

    <p>He used his physical strength to resist Li Huanran's blow. He just wanted to test how powerful Li Huanran was. The results proved that Li Huanran did live up to the name of Master Li Xiaokai's son. His attack was not only extremely fast but also very violent. !</p>

    <p>Of course, the most critical point is that Wang Zhen discovered that Li Huanran has extremely strong insight!</p>

    <p>The moment he struck, he noticed his intention to resist the Dragon Fist with his physical strength. So he switched to the "claw" skill of the Dragon Fist in the middle of the punch. By changing the pressure of the contact, the damage was increased!</p>

    <p>"As expected of a martial artist's son." Wang Zhen wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. The claw strike of Dragon Fist not only tore off a piece of his skin, but also injected energy into his body. It shocked Wang Zhen's internal organs. However, this level of internal injury is not a big deal to Wang Zhen. Because of his physical condition, Wang Zhen will vomit as much blood as he suffers internal injuries. And after vomiting blood, Wang Zhen's body can survive extremely Recovers on its own within a short period of time.</p>

    <p>This recovery mechanism includes creating new blood, repairing internal and external injuries, remodeling cells, repairing internal organs and various bone fractures...</p>

    <p>In other words, internal injuries are nothing to Wang Zhen. As long as he can vomit blood, internal injuries will be no problem.</p>

    <p>You know. Gu Shunzhi once punched him... He vomited three liters of blood on the spot...</p>

    <p>In comparison, Li Huanran's attack was very strong in Wang Zhen's opinion, but it was still far from enough.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>PS: A review of Master Li Xiaokai's past can be found in Chapter 1070 of the novel.</p>
