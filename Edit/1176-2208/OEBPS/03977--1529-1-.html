  <h1>Chapter 1529 Although it was just a dream. I was still very moved when I woke up.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a zombie-themed fake escape room.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling entered, darkness fell instantly.</p>

    <p>The first secret room is a warehouse full of sundries. The iron door is surrounded by a thick fine iron lock.</p>

    <p>The radius of the chain is very thick. It is five centimeters long. It seals the iron door like a python.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed a blood-stained beach chair ten meters away from the iron pole.</p>

    <p>There was a blood-stained coat hanging on it. Inside the clothes Wang Ling could see the flickering light of metal.</p>

    <p>That's a key.</p>

    <p>It should be a prop leading to the next secret room.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, you only need to use the "primer technique" to hook the key over easily.</p>

    <p>However, there is a limitation of spiritual power in the secret room. It is ten meters away. It is actually very difficult for others to successfully and accurately index such a small object.</p>

    <p>So this level. Wang Ling judgment. It must be combined with the props in the warehouse.</p>

    <p>Splice the props into a long hook. Hook the beach chair in front of it.</p>

    <p>But doing that would be too troublesome.</p>

    <p>When no one can cast spells normally.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling casts the spell. It will appear very abrupt.</p>

    <p>Even if the spiritual power restriction of the secret room has no effect on Wang Ling. He can't do that.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling grabbed the thick lock bar without thinking, and then tore off the entire lock bar with a "pop" sound.</p>

    <p>It didn't take much effort.</p>

    <p>Everything is so easy and natural.</p>

    <p>In the central control room.</p>

    <p>Jisaki was sweating coldly when he saw it. He could almost imagine the teachers in the props team going crazy.</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "Houlang Sang...is that strong..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming lied casually: "It's not that he's strong. He's just born with strange strength."</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "But this is outrageous! Such a thick chain! It's made of fine iron! It's so thick...why does it feel like pulling noodles when he pulls it up!"</p>

    <p>"Then I don't know. It could also be a quality issue." Wang Ming continued to help Wang Ling smooth things over.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the only people seeing this scene now are him and Jisaki. As long as Jisaki can stay steady, there won't be much of a problem.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ming was smiling bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>As soon as the closed-door competition was held, Wang Ling began to let himself go.</p>

    <p>No one was recording, no one was watching, it was a completely claustrophobic environment. What Wang Ling did could be described as "doing whatever he wants."</p>

    <p>He took the key hanging on the beach chair outside the iron door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used the power of King's Eyes to find the secret door leading to the second secret room.</p>

    <p>And convinced.</p>

    <p>It is indeed opened by the key obtained in hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never been a violent person.</p>

    <p>Destroying other people's props is actually very unethical.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling's plan is that if the key can be found, it would be better to use the key to open the door.</p>

    <p>As for taking down the door.</p>

    <p>That was a helpless move.</p>

    <p>As a person who is labeled as a "little milk dog" in the eyes of outsiders, Wang Ling actually pays great attention to the baggage of his idol.</p>

    <p>Holding the key and walking over.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling inserted the key into the keyhole of the secret door and turned it.</p>

    <p>Then. He heard another "pop" sound.</p>

    <p>The key just broke right into the keyhole.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The situation in front of me makes Wang Ling feel helpless.</p>

    <p>He really didn't twist it on purpose.</p>

    <p>But in this situation, it is obviously impossible to open the door with the key.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't find a way. It only used a little strength.</p>

    <p>I lightly kicked the door in front of me...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, other people and Wang Ling face the same concerns.</p>

    <p>The fully symmetrical design of the secret room ensures fairness in all aspects.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how classmate Wang Ling is doing." Sun Rong is actually a little concerned about the situation over there at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And these days, she always finds herself thinking of Wang Ling's face from time to time.</p>

    <p>In last night's dream, Wang Ling kept turning her over, which also made Sun Rong blush every time she thought about it.</p>

    <p>How do you say something?</p>

    <p>Although it was just a dream, I was still very touched when I woke up...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that maybe no one can understand how I feel at this moment.</p>

    <p>"It's better to clear the level quickly."</p>

    <p>After taking a deep breath, Sun Rong began to observe the environment of the first secret room.</p>

    <p>After learning that this was a warehouse with messy items.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong just knows it intuitively.</p>

    <p>Most of the things in these warehouses are actually used to disrupt the view and are not real clues.</p>

    <p>General secret room clues are not that complicated.</p>

    <p>It's very clear.</p>

    <p>So the food and drinks piled on the shelves in the warehouse are all useless.</p>

    <p>Then, the girl's eyes fell on the only iron door in sight.</p>

    <p>The thinking patterns of Wang Ling are surprisingly similar.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly fixed his gaze on the bloody suit.</p>

    <p>"The key is over there, right?" Sun Rong stared in the direction of the beach chair.</p>

    <p>A distance of ten meters. In addition, there are spiritual power restrictions. It is indeed difficult to accurately target the primer technique.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong is now blessed with the power of Aohai.</p>

    <p>But the role she plays is currently "Jiugong Liangzi." If Aohai's aura is released, it will inevitably make people suspicious.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong has already thought of a suitable solution.</p>

    <p>She moved out the props she had prepared in advance.</p>

    <p>That is a prop that is exactly the same as the replica {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>It's exactly the same in shape. It's just a fake. It doesn't have any {Ghost Book} function.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl imitated Jiugong Liangzi's appearance and opened the Ghost Book.</p>

    <p>A burst of light emanated from the Ghost Book.</p>

    <p>Actually. That's the LED light effect that comes with the prop...</p>

    <p>Since it's a show, then we have to do a complete set.</p>

    <p>Such a process is essential.</p>

    <p>Then, in the central control room... Jisaki saw that the bloody clothes on the beach chair actually floated up. He took the initiative to fly to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"This is..." He rubbed his eyes. He felt as if he had some misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, at the moment when the bloody clothes floated past, I seemed to see the figure of a female ghost...</p>

    <p>"In order for Rong Jiang to pretend to be her, Ms. Jiugong gave Rong Jiang the use of the Ghost Book? She even taught Rong Jiang how to use the Ghost Book?" Jisaki thought it was unbelievable.</p>

    <p>{Ghost Book} is the most important ancestral artifact in Jiugong's family...</p>

    <p>Can such a method be taught to outsiders?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded noncommittally. The expression on his face was somewhat meaningful.</p>

    <p>In fact, the female ghost figure Jisaki saw was not a real female ghost.</p>

    <p>But. Sun Ying'er...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ming couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>His younger brother and sister-in-law are very naughty!</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong successfully obtained the key.</p>

    <p>Then I quickly discovered the secret door hidden behind the shelves in the warehouse.</p>

    <p>Behind the secret door is a long passage with dim lights.</p>

    <p>When the secret door opens.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong found the passage leading to the next secret room. There was a familiar figure standing there, looking at her with a slightly ferocious look in the dim light.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Ma Jiao?"Sun Rong was startled.</p>

    <p>And the next moment.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao in front of her took out a bloody skull-crushing hammer from nowhere and rushed towards her.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong! I want you to die!" Ma Jiao roared like crazy.</p>
