  <h1>Chapter 1715 Everything is ready</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Suddenly her chin was pinched by a familiar hand. Sun Ying'er was frightened out of her wits on the spot. She thought about it in her mind. She almost thought of the scene where she was tortured by Wang Ying in the universe at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>This is a typical misfortune that comes from the mouth. Sun Ying'er did it more than once. So when Wang Ying pinched her chin, he looked very angry on the surface, but actually he was very happy in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that Sun Ying'er did it on purpose. She deliberately angered him in order to continue doing that kind of thing with him.</p>

    <p>"So. Are you trying to refuse but still welcome?" He stared at Sun Ying'er. There was a hint of depth in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's mouth was covered. She didn't dare to move or speak. In her heart, she was cursing and calling Wang Ying a pervert... She actually didn't quite understand why every time a girl said no, thought it was ironic.</p>

    <p>After these days of contact with Wang Ying, Sun Ying'er actually knows how to deal with Wang Ying. That is to just scold him behind his back. In fact, it doesn't matter at all.</p>

    <p>If you meet someone, just admit it and act coquettishly. Wang Ying won't do anything to her.</p>

    <p>So she tried hard to squeeze out a few tears that were swirling in her eyes. She looked at Wang Ying pitifully: "Well. You... hurt me..."</p>

    <p>Such a superb performance did not look fake. Wang Ying'er's hand relaxed a little. Seeing Wang Ying give in, Sun Ying'er knew that her plan had succeeded. He quickly changed the subject and said: "Now is not the time to talk about this."</p>

    <p>"Heh. I'll take care of you later in the evening." Wang Ying smiled and let go of her hand.</p>

    <p>He knew that Sun Ying'er was changing the subject, and it was a common tactic. It was true that he liked to "bully" Sun Ying'er. But recently, Wang Ying discovered that he didn't like Sun Ying'er's pitiful look at all. There is no way.</p>

    <p>Especially recently, Sun Ying'er didn't know where he learned the ability to act coquettishly. He has never been able to be ruthless enough to strike hard.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling, Master of Shadows and Senior Heavenly Dao. Why are you here?" Sun Rong asked at this time.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the atmosphere around her was beginning to become a little stiff, she could only speak out to help change the topic.</p>

    <p>Of course. The main reason is to stop Wang Ying and Sun Ying'er from openly flirting in front of her and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>In Sun Rong's opinion, isn't this just proper flirting!</p>

    <p>She and Wang Ling have made no progress at all!</p>

    <p>But she was so envious...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The scene was quiet for about a few seconds. Heavenly Dao, who was wearing a 60 High School guard uniform, finally cleared his throat and said, "Doesn't Miss Rong feel that something is wrong?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought about it carefully. She has been staying at her home. If the only thing that is unusual is the little daughter of the gardener Zhang San that Aunt Qiu mentioned to her before.</p>

    <p>"A little girl in a red dress came to the yard downstairs. Aunt Qiu said she was the youngest daughter of our gardener Zhang San. I felt that something was wrong." She said truthfully.</p>

    <p>"That's right. She is what we are looking for." Death Heavenly Dao replied: "This little girl is disguised by the Thought Plague. Her name is Chen Xiaomu. She should have nothing to do with your gardener. I'm afraid the Thought Plague has also taken control of Miss Rong's family. The servants put on a show together."</p>

    <p>"So they're trying to... target me?"</p>

    <p>"We still don't know what the purpose of this group of thought plaguers is. So we can't alert the snake yet."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying continued: "So, we still need you to cooperate with us in this matter."</p>

    <p>"Then what should I do?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"It's simple. Just let us enter your body." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He looked serious. But as soon as he finished speaking, Sun Rong's face suddenly turned red.</p>

    <p>Maybe he knew that what he said was ambiguous. Heavenly Dao quickly changed his words: "To be precise... it's the Sword Spirit Space. In this case, we can fully guarantee the safety of Miss Rong."</p>

    <p>The realm of Sun Rong is not enough. Naturally, it does not have its own core world.</p>

    <p>However, now it has the passive ability of "human and sword integration" with Aohai. When Aohai's "Sword Spirit Space" is shared with Sun Rong, its space ability is no less powerful than the normal core world.</p>

    <p>Even the "Sword Spirit Space" of the nine-core Aohai is already completely comparable to the "Supreme World!"</p>

    <p>Of course Sun Rong knows what death Heavenly Dao means.</p>

    <p>With the current power of the nine-core Aohai, the sword spirit space inside it can accommodate three billion people, let alone three people.</p>

    <p>She had been protected by Wang Ling and Jin Deng before. She had been to their inherent spiritual realm or core world. But she never thought that one day Wang Ling would also enter hers.</p>

    <p>But there is always a first time in life...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has seen many big scenes. Although she was a little surprised by this sudden proposal, she quickly regained his composure.</p>

    <p>She wants to help Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And. Never let him down.</p>

    <p>With this thought, she released her Aohai sword energy. At the same time, she raised her sword fingers to create a hole in the void. Let Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Death Heavenly Dao enter her sword spirit space. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Chen Xiaomu, who had successfully lurked into Sun Rong's home, thought her plan was perfect. She was sent here by the organization. The original purpose was for surveillance. But later, with the murder of Jin Deng, the organization reached its peak. The plan changed again.</p>

    <p>According to reliable intelligence data, this ordinary female cultivator from Earth possesses a total of nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes... and these nine Rubik's Cubes will be the key elements for their next big plan.</p>

    <p>Next. Just find a way to enter Sun Rong's body...</p>

    <p>However, Chen Xiaomu knew that it was not that easy to enter Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>According to the information obtained by the group, Sun Rong's body has been illuminated. Random intrusion may be dangerous.</p>

    <p>But the power of the Thought Plague is that in addition to a single invasion, it can also be a team invasion.</p>

    <p>This is the method chosen when facing those powerful cultivators.</p>

    <p>However, due to the special relationship of Sun Rong, Chen Xiaomu must ensure that this matter is foolproof.</p>

    <p>So after being brought to Sun Rong's home, she mobilized her troops. In addition, she used her own methods to infect. More than 95% of the more than 100 servants in Sun Rong's residence were within her control.</p>

    <p>Of course, she also carefully kept some of the people who were close to Sun Rong, deliberately not allowing them to be controlled. This was for the purpose of letting Sun Rong relax her vigilance.</p>

    <p>And now. Everything is ready...</p>

    <p>With many brothers and sisters nearby, more than ninety thought plaguers jointly launched an attack on the same person.</p>

    <p>Chen Xiaomu didn't believe that Sun Rong could still run away.</p>
