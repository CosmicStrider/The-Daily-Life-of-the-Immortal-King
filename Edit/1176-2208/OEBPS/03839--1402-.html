  <h1>Chapter 1402 It turns out that being beaten is also foreshadowing!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Is she the granddaughter of Marshal Jiang? Judging from the current situation, it seems hard to say.</p>

    <p>There are many people with the same surname in this world, so the possibility of accidents cannot be ruled out.</p>

    <p>But for the name Jiang Yingying, Er Ha felt it was very familiar before, and now combined with the exact address of Northwest Road, he almost had a conclusion in his mind.</p>

    <p>Even if Jiang Yingying is not Marshal Jiang's biological granddaughter, it is definitely related.</p>

    <p>There was a time when he lived in Wei Zhi's house and played two-team games with Wei Zhi. Marshal Jiang often went upstairs to visit. The relationship between the old marshal and Wei Zhi had always been very good. And it was during this visit that Er Ha seemed to hear the two of them I mentioned this name.</p>

    <p>In short, whether it has anything to do with the old marshal or not.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that he still needs to know why Jiang Yingying has a crush on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>All emotions cannot arise for no reason. She read the love letter in her hand several times. Jiang Yingying did not directly explain how she met Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is obviously a girl from a foreign school</p>

    <p>Could it be that she was a fan girl attracted by her classmate Wang Ling at the exchange meeting between Number 60 High School and other schools?</p>

    <p>For a time. Sun Rong had many answers in his mind.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you just add WeChat and ask?" Er Ha said with a smile. Like everyone else, he is the type who just watches the fun and doesn't take it too seriously.</p>

    <p>"Girls generally don't add strangers' WeChat messages easily. So you have to get familiar with her first, and then find a way to get close to her." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>The girl looked at the mobile phone number on the love letter. After confirming that the mobile phone number could be added directly to Jiang Yingying's WeChat, she decided to endure it for the time being. She suppressed her urge to add a friend to find out.</p>

    <p>The more times like this, the more she has to calm down</p>

    <p>There is a saying that mistakes are made while busy. Now that you have only one opponent, you can't mess up your position.</p>

    <p>Anyway, as long as it's a matter within campus circles, it's easy to handle.</p>

    <p>While waiting for school tomorrow. Sun Rong decided to activate his interpersonal relationships in the student union.</p>

    <p>In this way, more information about Jiang Yingying can be obtained.</p>

    <p>"Let's stop the investigation here today. I'll send a text message to Sister Qingyi and take a rest." Sun Rong stretched.</p>

    <p>"What text message did you send Liu Qingyi?" Er Ha was stunned.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong first turned his attention to the pile of remaining love letters. Then he showed an extremely kind smile: "Of course. Let me tell you about Brother Wang Zhen!"</p>

    <p>"Er Ha: ..."</p>

    <p>In the past two days, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi are planning to rent a house. Choosing the type of house, redecorating and purchasing furniture. These are all tasks.</p>

    <p>At this time, they were settling in a high-end love hotel.</p>

    <p>The hotel's facilities are all available. The luxurious suites are equipped with shelves for drinks and fruits of various seasons, beauty instruments, a full set of intelligent health massage equipment and even a built-in swimming pool.</p>

    <p>The young couple had just confirmed their relationship. It was a time when they were inseparable.</p>

    <p>And Wang Zhen worked very hard. He was almost at the front and did all the dirty work.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi is wearing a swimsuit. She is applying facial mask on the lounge chair.</p>

    <p>The originally relaxed mood was broken by a sudden text message.</p>

    <p>This message comes from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The content of the text message was simple. It was a photo of a pile of love letters piled on the ground.</p>

    <p>And a very short sentence: Wang Zhen shows mercy everywhere.</p>

    <p>The camera function of King's Eyes captures photos with crystal clear clarity.</p>

    <p>It also comes with 360-degree all-round analysis capabilities without blind spots.</p>

    <p>In other words, as long as Liu Qingyi clicks on any letter on this photo, he can see the content of the letter.</p>

    <p>The analytical ability of King's Eyes is so strong. Even photos in blind spots can be fully analyzed.</p>

    <p>Even the erased parts of the letter have been restored.</p>

    <p>For example, the word "true" in "Classmate Wang Zhen." Previously, the word "true" was erased by Wang Zhen. Now after going through King's Eyes, it has been restored again.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi clicked on some of the letters.</p>

    <p>Everyone is feeling bad</p>

    <p>The mask on his face fell to the ground with a splat.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to have a bedtime meeting?" Wang Zhen came over on his own initiative. He squatted down and put his arms around Liu Qingyi's neck from behind.</p>

    <p>However, this time around, he suddenly felt that something was wrong with the current atmosphere.</p>

    <p>No! What the hell is going on here?</p>

    <p>He didn't seem to have done anything wrong today.</p>

    <p>Bite!</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi received a second text message.</p>

    <p>This is from Sun Rong</p>

    <p>It perfectly matches the content of the text message Wang Ling sent before.</p>

    <p>"These love letters. Aren't you going to explain them to me?" Liu Qingyi took a deep breath. Her body was already shaking wildly, but she still tried to stay calm."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt as if there was a word "danger" hanging over his head at this moment.</p>

    <p>He tried to quibble: "The names written on this love letter are all classmates. Wang may be writing it to Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>"You still want to frame Ling Zhenren for this little trick?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi smiled. She clicked on the photo that had been fully analyzed by King's Eyes. Wang Zhen was immediately dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Zhen was roaring in his heart.</p>

    <p>Damn! Is it necessary?</p>

    <p>Just some love letters!</p>

    <p>Even the ability of King's Eyes is used</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen cried.</p>

    <p>The key is that he is not the real instigator!</p>

    <p>This idea was obviously proposed by this guy Fang Xing!</p>

    <p>Why should he bear the blame alone?</p>

    <p>"First of all, it is impossible for Ling Zhenren to tell lies. Secondly, my disciple's text message also verified Ling Zhenren's statement. What the hell are you doing?" Liu Qingyi looked at Wang Zhen and snorted: "You want to Destroy the love letters. So you don't stop doing the same thing and blame it all on Ling Zhenren? You are so brave, Wang Zhen!"</p>

    <p>"These love letters were actually written by others before we established a relationship. I'm too popular. You can't blame me for that," Wang Zhen whispered. He felt very wronged.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he felt that he had no excuse. He was afraid that even if he jumped into the Yellow River, he would not be able to clean himself.</p>

    <p>"I can't explain this clearly, but I admit it! You can punish him however you want," Wang Zhen sighed.</p>

    <p>As he said this, he took the initiative and walked to the fruit stand and took out a durian.</p>

    <p>"Yo? Are you trying to get me here? Don't think I'll feel sorry for you! Kneel down if you can."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi raised her hand and used a metal hardening technique to directly turn the durian in Wang Zhen's hand into an iron durian. The hardness increased several levels.</p>

    <p>However, when Wang Zhen faced such changes, he did not show the slightest emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>He knelt down directly in front of the durian.</p>

    <p>With a "pop" sound, the entire iron durian was immediately torn apart and Wang Zhen's knees were completely unaffected!</p>

    <p>"Why are you so skilled!" Liu Qingyi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I often get beaten by my parents when I was little? Durian made of diamonds. I also knelt down."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Ma's teleportation golden light accurately landed on the edge of the swimming pool.</p>

    <p>A Heavenly Dao durian that had been inspired by Wang Ling appeared in front of Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>(There is actually an easter egg in this chapter. Combine it with the setting that Lord Ma's teleportation golden light can only teleport the places you have been. You will find something that is terrifying to think about)</p>
