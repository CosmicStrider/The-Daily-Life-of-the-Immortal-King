  <h1>Chapter 1694 Send yourself out</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Is this... really possible?" Sun Rong looked doubtful about Jiugong Liangzi's plan.</p>

    <p>Not to mention whether this method is feasible or not. No matter how well she hides it, Wang Ling will probably be able to see it out at a glance.</p>

    <p>In the past, when she didn't know how strong Wang Ling was, she might have given it a try. But now that she knows Wang Ling's true strength, trying this method would simply make herself uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. Maybe there will be a chance." Monk Jin Deng knew what Sun Rong's concerns were. He couldn't help but smile: "Miss Rong is still worried after all. She will be seen out. But if we take a multi-pronged approach. Maybe we can hide it."</p>

    <p>The monk said this, in fact, in his heart he did not really want to help Sun Rong, but wanted to try to see if there was really a way to deceive Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Challenging Wang Ling is the daily life of monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Even if he can't beat him in terms of hard power, the monk still wants to challenge him in other aspects on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>Although it is said that family members should not be competitive, the monk never felt that he was competitive. It was clearly an ambition to take challenges.</p>

    <p>But does he have the right to challenge? In fact, the key point still lies in Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Next to Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi and Er Ha vaguely felt that this thing sounded unreliable. But Sun Rong's birthday surprise was obviously unstoppable.</p>

    <p>What happens next is that one dares to speak and the other dares to listen.</p>

    <p>"Then senior...what should I do?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"This matter requires a three-pronged approach if we are to conceal the truth." Monk Jin Deng suggested, "The first thing is to, distract him. Just like what Miss Liangzi said, send enough dry crispy noodles, this way, it will keep Ling Zhenren's attention from focusing on the big gift box that Miss Rong is in."</p>

    <p>"It makes sense! Senior, continue!" Sun Rong believed it to be true.</p>

    <p>"The second thing is that we need to make a fuss about the packaging. At that time, the poor monk will personally help Miss Rong. Miss Rong only needs to use the gold charms that the poor monk has blessed and apply it all over her body. Although it is probably impossible to deceive Ling Zhenren. But. At least we can resist it for a while."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng gave advice and said: "Then...the most important point is. That is about Ling Zhenren's King's Eyes. With King's Eyes, there is the ability to eliminate the false and preserve the true. Any disguise is useless. Therefore, this matter We also need help from brother Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>"I?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi pointed at himself. The expression on his face gradually became more and more mad: "Hahaha! Okay! How can I help!"</p>

    <p>This is not the first time that he, a disciple, has cheated his master.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it is also to promote the relationship between Wang Ling and Sun Rong. Of course he is bound to do such a thing.</p>

    <p>"I remember that brother Zhuo Yi has a sharing mechanism for King's Eyes. So at the moment Ling Zhenren receives the gift, can we use the ability to share King's Eyes to temporarily turn off the passive ability of King's Eyes to prevent the removal of the false and the true? Passive ability."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Of course. You don't need to resist for too long. A few minutes is enough."</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi touched his chin, frowned, and then said: "I have never tried to do this before... I don't know if it will work. Also, does this count as cheating the teacher and destroying the ancestor..."</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Brother, you are overthinking this. What kind of deception is this to deceive one's master and destroy one's ancestors? It is obviously a beautiful story that will lead to a good marriage."</p>

    <p>"That's it..." Zhuo Yi nodded: "Okay. Then I'll give it a try."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Seeing a group of people discussing the subsequent plan so seriously, Jiugong Liangzi began to regret his previous proposal.</p>

    <p>About giving gifts. That's what she said...</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Sun Rong was completely treating a dead horse as a living doctor, but she really believed it!</p>

    <p>She doesn't know why. She always has a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the evening, after returning to the cadre apartment, Zhuo Yi immediately drafted an "acceptance plan" for the Office of Strategic Deception's official takeover plan for the Science and Technology City in Virtual Realm.</p>

    <p>He has a special status in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In addition to the position of Elder guest secretary, he is also one of the ministers of the Office of Strategic Deception. The current Office of Strategic Deception is divided into eight departments. The eighth department he is in mainly performs the following three responsibilities: </p>

    <p>Supervise the overall discipline of the sect.</p>

    <p>Coordinating the future direction of the sect.</p>

    <p>And planning the current development plan.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it can also be summarized using vocabulary on the Internet as: dog management + dog planning...</p>

    <p>This time, the Office of Strategic Deception took action against the Science and Technology City in advance. Reporting without approval is actually suspected of violating the regulations. Therefore, in this case, Zhuo Yi needs to highlight the danger of this Science and Technology City in the plan. Make that part an "emergency escape" and then report it to Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>There are only two subsequent results. One is that after the docking is completed by the Office of Strategic Deception, Huaxiu Alliance then takes over the Science and Technology City.</p>

    <p>The first is to be fully taken over by the Office of Strategic Deception. The branch will be expanded smoothly.</p>

    <p>Of course, one more technology city or one less technology city, this is nowadays the Office of Strategic Deception is irrelevant to the Office of Strategic Deception, the Office of Strategic Deception is now the first clan, strong soldiers and horses, strong strength.</p>

    <p>What we have to do is not to become stronger blindly. It is to find a way to stabilize our current position.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Zhuo Yi, as the head of the eight divisions of the Office of Strategic Deception, naturally had to make sure that there would not be any mistakes.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>In addition to this "acceptance plan", Zhuo Yi also has another plan. That is about Zhou Ziyi's apprenticeship plan...</p>

    <p>After this incident, he felt that Zhou Ziyi was fully qualified to become his disciple with his outstanding personal performance.</p>

    <p>And now, all that's left is a nod from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Among the first batch of people to go back, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were also among them.</p>

    <p>They also heard about Wang Ling's birthday. They didn't care much about Sun Rong's plans. They were more concerned about what they should give as a gift.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, both of them tacitly believed that no one had more say than the person they were going to meet next.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's private research institute, the two handed the memory chip to Wang Ming himself according to the instructions of Wang Ming's brainwave clone in the science and technology city.</p>

    <p>The moment he saw the chip, Wang Ming knew what was going on. Holding the chip, he couldn't help but smile: "So that's it. Have you copied your own memories in the science and technology city? It's very much like my clone."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ming from Science and Technology City said that there will be important research materials in it."</p>

    <p>"After all, my opponent is the legendary Eternal One, a man who has mastered the core technology in the Eternal Era. It will naturally be helpful to my research." Wang Ming said this. He couldn't help but sigh: "It's just this It's a pity..."</p>

    <p>Li Xian looked at Wang Ming: "Mr. Ming is referring to... is that Shou Chong?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ming nodded and said, "It is said that after he was captured, he was divided. Master Wu Xin's disciple Nawei was integrated into his brain."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhang Zhui nodded and said, "It's a pity that Brother Li Xian and I went too late. Otherwise, maybe we could have saved him."</p>

    <p>"It's all destiny."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed. Then he inserted the chip in his hand directly into a helmet-shaped decomposer. Then he put the helmet on his head: "Then let's take a look. Then What useful news did I bring..."</p>
