  <h1>Chapter 1328 Wang Ling comes out to the monk</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's wardrobe can accommodate the stars and the sea.</p>

    <p>It is a spirit specially enlightened for the universe. It can be locked to any corner of the universe.</p>

    <p>However, after opening the cabinet, only people with an IQ over 300 can see the universe inside the cabinet.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling's wardrobe is also called the "Emperor's New Cabinet"...</p>

    <p>Reaching the unspeakable place. It is not difficult for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>He actually came out as gay with a monk.</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng was extremely desperate.</p>

    <p>He could actually expect that if Wang Ling led the way, he might reach the unspeakable place much earlier than he did.</p>

    <p>Maybe just three hours?</p>

    <p>But the monk never expected that Wang Ling would find the unspeakable place in three seconds with just one coordinate.</p>

    <p>The huge disparity in strength made the monk feel hurt.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had to practice hard for at least 300 million lives to reach this level...</p>

    <p>As expected of Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>The fastest man in the universe.</p>

    <p>"Let's go and have a look."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent a message to the monk.</p>

    <p>Then, I stepped into the closet and came to the universe.</p>

    <p>The monk followed closely behind. After he took his steps.</p>

    <p>The closet door banged and was quickly closed.</p>

    <p>The monk felt like he had seen this scene in a detective cartoon.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling's eyes were fixed on the floating island in the universe that was wrapped in a layer of light film in front of him.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling. was shocked by such a magical place created by great magic power.</p>

    <p>Is that the Unspeakable Place established by Dao Ancestor Wang?</p>

    <p>Everything is just as the monk said at the beginning.</p>

    <p>The Unspeakable Land looks like a golden egg of Dharma light from a distance.</p>

    <p>The outermost protective light film is relatively easy to break through. It shines outside like an egg shell.</p>

    <p>And "yolk" is the essence of the unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>--A gorgeous floating island shining with golden light.</p>

    <p>From the straight line of sight, Wang Ling also feels that the unspeakable place is very close to him.</p>

    <p>But it is this close distance. The monk tried countless times but failed to reach the hinterland smoothly.</p>

    <p>For many years, this has been a major regret in the monk's heart. It is also a knot that he cannot untie.</p>

    <p>"It's not difficult to break through the outer layer of light film. The key lies in the middle layer of egg white, which is the circle of chaos." The monk said.</p>

    <p>The monk had already said this to Wang Ling when we were in the temple before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows it by heart.</p>

    <p>Naturally, I also understand the stakes involved.</p>

    <p>He flew into the void and quickly flew over with the monk. Then he raised his sword fingers together and made a hole in the outermost light film.</p>

    <p>It's an understatement. It's really powerful.</p>

    <p>This made the monk's mouth twitch again.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect Wang Ling to get in without using any fancy spells at all...</p>

    <p>Although he himself can break through the light film.</p>

    <p>But when he entered, he had to hit the light film hundreds of times before he could barely break through a gap and enter.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?"Wang Ling felt something was wrong with the monk's expression.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I just want to say that Zhenren is awesome..." The monk closed his eyes and performed a Buddhist salute.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his state of mind over the years was not in vain.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, in the face of this huge sense of gap, I might have become autistic long ago.</p>

    <p>Successfully entered the second level of the circle of chaos.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately realized that his body was experiencing the impact of the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>Normal cultivators will feel very painful.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is different.</p>

    <p>He felt like he had stepped into a jacuzzi.</p>

    <p>Quite comfortable.</p>

    <p>The monk stared at Wang Ling's expression. Something felt wrong.</p>

    <p>He often felt the urge to overturn the table.</p>

    <p>What kind of trouble is going on with this happy face!!!</p>

    <p>In this second level of chaos, a monk will not last long.</p>

    <p>Although there is no special physical discomfort.</p>

    <p>But when you enter here, you won't feel as comfortable as Wang Ling... when you see the monk's expression of defeat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought the monk couldn't hold on anymore. He stretched out his hand and hit the monk with a golden light.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ling's "Supreme Protective Golden Light."</p>

    <p>It is considered a special and exclusive magic weapon.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling's physical body is too strong. Usually this golden light is of no use.</p>

    <p>Now it can be distributed to monks.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of this "golden light of supreme protection", the monk's ability to resist the power of chaos instantly increased.</p>

    <p>He finally felt it. The feeling of being soaked in a "Jacuzzi."</p>

    <p>"It feels so good...why does it feel so good..."</p>

    <p>The monk couldn't help but make a sound.</p>

    <p>It is hard to imagine that an eminent monk would show such an expression.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he was blind. He quickly took another step forward, trying to move towards the core area.</p>

    <p>He took one step forward and turned himself into a light-like existence. He completed the long-distance shuttle almost in an instant.</p>

    <p>This is not "shrinking the ground into an inch." It is a far stronger movement technique than "shrinking the ground into an inch."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling named it "An in of time."</p>

    <p>Every time Wang Ling takes a step, the monk has to use Shrinkage 100 times in a row to catch up.</p>

    <p>This made the monk feel a little strenuous.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I was once again shocked by the "power possessed by non-human cultivators" in Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>An unspeakable place. Extremely close to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just based on the visual distance. Wang Ling determines that it only needs to cast "An in of time" twice to reach the hinterland.</p>

    <p>But now, he has taken a full 10 steps.</p>

    <p>The unspeakable place in front of them was clearly right in front of them. However, the distance between them never shortened.</p>

    <p>"Interesting."Wang Ling whispered two words.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Dao Ancestor Wang, the "forbidden maniac", also created a problem for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Dao Ancestor Wang's prohibition is well-deserved... Back then, the poor monk suffered repeated defeats. I don't know if I am here with Ling Zhenren today. Can he fulfill the poor monk's long-cherished wish to enter the unspeakable place."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk sighed. He stared at Wang Ling: "I think with Zhenren's strength, it shouldn't be difficult to unlock the restriction, right?"</p>

    <p>The monk is testing.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling wants to solve it, of course it can be solved...</p>

    <p>It's just that the restriction is complicated. Wang Ling has already made this analogy a long time ago.</p>

    <p>It's like an arithmetic problem.</p>

    <p>If you want to solve it, the best way is to work backwards.</p>

    <p>But this takes a long, long time.</p>

    <p>In fact, now that time is tight, there is not that much time left for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"It's too much trouble."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head slightly and answered the monk's words.</p>

    <p>"Does even Zhenren find it troublesome..." Disappointment suddenly appeared on the monk's face.</p>

    <p>However, before he could express further opinions, Wang Ling said again: "Just overwrite it."</p>

    <p>"Overwrite...overwrite?"</p>

    <p>The monk's eyes lit up and he showed a shocked expression: "What Zhenren means is that you want to directly cover the prohibition imposed by Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>This is what he thought of. The most convenient way.</p>

    <p>The parsing process is too cumbersome.</p>

    <p>Might as well create a new ban. Replace all the old ones...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stretched out his hand. A huge red-gold light was released from his palm.</p>

    <p>This light covers the entire unspeakable land.</p>

    <p>About 3 minutes later.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put your hands down.</p>

    <p>"It's done?" The monk was stunned.</p>

    <p>"It's done."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>The ban has been modified.</p>

    <p>"What was changed?" the monk was curious.</p>

    <p>"Anyone who can withstand more than 10 of my palms (including 10 palms) can enter." Wang Ling's message.</p>

    <p>"..." Monk Jin Deng.</p>
