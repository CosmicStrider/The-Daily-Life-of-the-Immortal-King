  <h1>Chapter 1444 Another eldest lady</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The symbol of the Jiugong family is a crow with purple gemstones in its eyes. Wang Ling speculates that this may be related to the purple pupils inherited by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>"Yin Yang pupils?" Wang Ling looked at Jiugong's pair of purple pupils from the corner of his eye. He knew the origin instantly.</p>

    <p>This can be considered a very rare thing. After all, Jiugong started his career by exorcising demons and suppressing evil spirits.</p>

    <p>It's just like the ancestors rewarded me with food.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>If only he could make money with his own abilities...</p>

    <p>It's a pity. The family rules are very strict.</p>

    <p>Although this is the first meeting between Wang Ling and Jiugong.</p>

    <p>But judging from my intuition. Wang Ling feels that Jiugong is not a bad person.</p>

    <p>After all, foreigners who can accept the idea of adding dry crispy noodles to shortbread are actually quite rare.</p>

    <p>Jiugong stopped in front of a pancake and fruit stall. Behind her stood a female bodyguard wearing a suit and sunglasses.</p>

    <p>This female bodyguard has tattoos of the Jiugong family logo on her ankles and wrists. She is looking at the pancake and fruit stall in front of her with a worried look: "Miss, the food at the roadside stall is unhygienic..."</p>

    <p>"Humph! You're not clean. You'll be fine after eating! Back off!" Jiugong glanced at the female bodyguard coldly. With one look, the female bodyguard obediently stepped back.</p>

    <p>The majesty of the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family does have a very strong aura.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately comes to mind Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And realized the difference between the two.</p>

    <p>Although they are both eldest ladies, Sun Rong originally took a people-friendly route with the purpose of attracting other people's attention. But Jiugong is different. She is an icy beauty with a strong aura that is daunting.</p>

    <p>The old man didn't dare to say or ask. He just wanted to concentrate on finishing the pancakes in his hands.</p>

    <p>He didn't recognize the girl named Jiugong. But he also knew that she was a young lady with a strong aura.</p>

    <p>Punch this way. Other students will not dare to approach easily...</p>

    <p>Since it was his first time doing this girl's business, the old man hesitated in his hand movements during the painting process.</p>

    <p>"Girl. Do you want chili?"</p>

    <p>"Abnormally spicy!"</p>

    <p>"Would you like cilantro?"</p>

    <p>"don't want."</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>Then, the old man used a spatula to open the bottom of the pancake and pour the prepared crispy noodle crumbs on top.</p>

    <p>Finally, he rolled up the whole pancake, wrapped it in oil-absorbing paper, and put it in a disposable plastic bag. He handed it to Jiugong with both hands: "Girl, be careful to burn it."</p>

    <p>The whole process only takes a minute.</p>

    <p>"One minute of Chinese food. Interesting."</p>

    <p>Jiugong took it carefully. He stared at the pancake fruit in his hand and thought for a while. Then he took a tentative bite.</p>

    <p>The wonderful taste instantly invaded Jiugong's taste buds. A flash of light quickly flashed in her purple eyes.</p>

    <p>"How does it taste?" Heavenly Dao, who was wearing a school guard uniform, looked at Jiugong in front of him.</p>

    <p>"That's it. It's not as delicious as the octopus balls downstairs at my house."</p>

    <p>Jiugong commented coldly. Then he took another big bite.</p>

    <p>Pancake Master, Wang Ling, Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>Dare you. Is this still a tsundere?</p>

    <p>You say it doesn't taste good, but your body is very honest!</p>

    <p>"My bodyguard is right. Your stall is too small. And the plates are dirty. It's not very hygienic."</p>

    <p>"I'm causing trouble for this classmate." The old man bowed helplessly.</p>

    <p>Eating the pancakes on his hands with satisfaction. Jiugong Liangzi hummed to the old man again: "I just have a taste. I won't buy it a second time."</p>

    <p>Then, she walked slowly into the gate of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Same as Jiang Yingying yesterday. Today she is here to register for school.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was biting pancakes while walking slowly behind Jiugong.</p>

    <p>As they approached the teaching building, Wang Ling heard Jiugong Liangzi whisper to the female bodyguard next to him: "You. Put on your casual clothes and go to the pancake stall just now."</p>

    <p>"Okay, miss." The female bodyguard said knowingly: "Is it going to be smashed? I'll do it right away."</p>

    <p>"Smash whatever you want!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong was so anxious that he almost shouted: "I asked you to buy me 20 more! When you wear casual clothes, remember to cover your tattoo. Don't scare others."</p>

    <p>"So. Is this compensation?" the female bodyguard smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>She realized that this was her young lady trying to compensate the old man just now.</p>

    <p>After all, when buying pancakes, many other students did not dare to come forward, which delayed the old man's business.</p>

    <p>"Huh. Compensation? Do you really think I am doing charity? This is charity. Charity!" Jiugong Liangzi emphasized in a low voice.</p>

    <p>"Yes. What the lady said is correct."</p>

    <p>"Besides, when the uncle's business is finished, you go and build a shop for him at the entrance of the school. I will finance it from my account." Jiugong gnawed on the pancakes in his hand. The expression on his face was neither sad nor happy, but the two lines on his cheeks The delicious blush never goes away.</p>

    <p>"Miss, this is..."</p>

    <p>"It's too dirty. Clean up the city."</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Liangzi finished speaking, he hummed slightly and walked towards the principal's office.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched Jiugong Liangzi leave. At the same time, he was deeply impressed by his {{Rule of Judgment of Crispy Noodles}}.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, his guess was right.</p>

    <p>People who like to eat crispy noodles are not that bad.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is not a bad person, but with such a character, if other people don't understand him well, it might be easy to offend them.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling finished the last bite of pancakes. He chewed his fingers habitually. He thought to himself.</p>

    <p>Having said that.</p>

    <p>There are quite a few transfer students recently.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying yesterday. Jiugong Liangzi today.</p>

    <p>But it seems that Jiugong Liangzi is not here for him. This makes Wang Ling feel relieved immediately.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the principal's office. Principal Chen, Zhuo Yi has been waiting for a long time.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family settled in Number 60 High School. This is a big deal.</p>

    <p>As the principal, Principal Chen is naturally happy. In this way, Number 60 High School will be in line with international standards.</p>

    <p>In the future, we can even use the Jiugong family's power on Sun Island to carry out exchange activities.</p>

    <p>This is the day Jiugong Liangzi came to Number 60 High School to register. Principal Chen would have welcomed her in person. There was just one thing... Jiugong Liangzi made a request. Asking Zhuo Yi to receive her.</p>

    <p>At this time, he felt Jiugong Liangzi's breath approaching. Principal Chen patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder: "Zhuo Yi brother, I'll leave the rest to you. I'll avoid it first."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Principal." Zhuo Yi smiled politely. Then he saw Principal Chen open the cabinet next to him and got in.</p>

    <p>He made a goodbye gesture towards Zhuo Yi and then quickly disappeared.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gasped...</p>

    <p>He actually set up the teleportation array in the cabinet.</p>

    <p>It has some meaning!</p>

    <p>As soon as Principal Chen left, Jiugong Liangzi opened the door and walked in alone.</p>

    <p>There were no other bodyguards behind her. The one who was following her earlier was sent to buy pancakes and fruits. Jiugong Liangzi also sent her away on purpose.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, Jiugong Liangzi saw Zhuo Yi walking over with a smile on his face: "Hello, classmate Jiugong. I am Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Who knows. Jiugong Liangzi slapped Zhuo Yi's hand away with a "pop" sound: "Shake hands. No need."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was not sure what happened. As a result, there was some anger in Jiugong Liangzi's eyes.</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl glanced at the sofa next to her and sat down directly as if she were a guest.</p>

    <p>"I don't know. Where have you offended classmate Jiugong?" Zhuo Yi is still confused.</p>

    <p>"Don't get me wrong, Mr. Zhuo. It's not me you offended."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi stared at Zhuo Yi: "But the entire Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>"Ah?"Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Are you still pretending to be stupid? Mr. Liar."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi smiled mysteriously.</p>

    <p>Now. She was holding her arms. Her long, thin, flowing legs were folded together. Looking at Zhuo Yi: "Six years ago. The gate of the Otherworld descended. The person who killed the Demon King. It doesn' t seem to be you."</p>
