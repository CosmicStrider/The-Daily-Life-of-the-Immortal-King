  <h1>Chapter 1521 This wave. Which floor are you on?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>King's Eyes is a trick that is "either there or not. The virtual and the real are intertwined." Wang Ling is actually used a very limited number of times.</p>

    <p>In his memory, he used this "eight-character pupil technique" no more than three times in total. And the first two times he unintentionally pulled off a prank later on.</p>

    <p>The power of the Eight-Character Eye Technique is self-evident. It can turn reality into illusion.</p>

    <p>Then transform fantasy into reality.</p>

    <p>This ability is really too terrifying.</p>

    <p>A little carelessness may trigger a series of butterfly effects.</p>

    <p>And now the reason for using Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Or because the gap in combat power between Ma Jiao and himself is large enough. In essence, even if there is some butterfly effect, Ma Jiao cannot pose a substantial threat.</p>

    <p>However. If it is used against Peng Xiren's level...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to weigh it carefully.</p>

    <p>People like Peng Xiren. Wang Ling thinks it is more reliable to kill him with one move.</p>

    <p>In this way, there will be no possibility of extraneous matters.</p>

    <p>And now the reason why he still keeps Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>There is no other reason.</p>

    <p>Just because of the black stone.</p>

    <p>Such a big black stone was left in Peng Xiren's hands.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt itchy to watch.</p>

    <p>But now, Peng Xiren seems to be borrowing the power of the black stone to hide and deal with himself behind his back.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to see... how long this Peng Xiren can hide.</p>

    <p>As long as he dares to show his face.</p>

    <p>That mysterious black stone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is determined to win.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>The two people who were originally sent by Jiugong Xiushi to kidnap Wang Ling. In addition to the driver who was watching the streets... there were three people in total. They were completely frightened by Wang Ling's methods and kowtowed.</p>

    <p>They didn't even dare to raise their heads. There was a sense of awe in their hearts.</p>

    <p>It saves Wang Ling a lot of worry.</p>

    <p>The leader of the group, Mediterranean, had a clear mind.</p>

    <p>A boss like this who doesn't care about world affairs and chooses to hide himself as a high school student must not want people to see his true face... Some things, it's better not to know what you shouldn't know.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, even if I have ten lives, it may not be enough.</p>

    <p>Based on the self-introduction just now.</p>

    <p>This bald man's name is Yitong.</p>

    <p>The younger brother following the action and the driver waiting on the street called Ertong and Santong.</p>

    <p>They have no names.</p>

    <p>They were all picked by Jiugong Xiushi from the street. They were homeless people who had some potential for spiritual practice.</p>

    <p>He has no father or mother, and is homeless. But he has a good foundation and is suitable for spiritual practice.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi specifically asked One-Eyed Samurai around him to search for such a group of people and train them into his subordinates.</p>

    <p>The three people in front of me can be regarded as the three most senior people among all the people Jiugong Xiushi has collected.</p>

    <p>"Senior... Master Xiushi. I actually didn't mean to offend you... If senior must be blamed, it will cost the lives of the three of us... Don't hurt Master Xiushi." The leader, codenamed Yitong, said.</p>

    <p>After all, given their background, without the help of Jiugong Xiushi, they would still be just idle members of society.</p>

    <p>No matter how evil Jiugong Xiushi is.</p>

    <p>To them, they are also benefactors.</p>

    <p>Hearing these words from Yitong. Wang Ling was actually a little moved in his heart.</p>

    <p>This one is a man.</p>

    <p>Willing to give his life for Jiugong Xiushi.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Jiugong Xiushi has a good eye for recognizing people.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling sighed helplessly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He actually.</p>

    <p>I have no intention of taking anyone's life...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why many people treat strong people.</p>

    <p>Just imagine the kind of devil who wants people's lives at every turn.</p>

    <p>Although he is very strong, he is not a devil at all.</p>

    <p>He is just an ordinary high school student. He studies very ordinary and looks very ordinary...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he is the type who will be drowned in a sea of people.</p>

    <p>There seems to be an invisible whirlpool around him. It always draws all kinds of troubles to him and he doesn't want to meddle in his own business.</p>

    <p>And now what happened to Ma Jiao is exactly like that.</p>

    <p>After confirming that there is some kind of secret ghost on Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling In order to further confirm his guess, he needs to find someone to conduct an investigation.</p>

    <p>Sun Island is an unfamiliar place.</p>

    <p>So in this situation, one tube, two tubes and three tubes are a good choice.</p>

    <p>He summoned his chatty clone named "Houlang" and began to further communicate with the three of them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not good at words.</p>

    <p>So having a chatty clone is actually very important. And tonight, in order to rescue those students who were forcibly transformed into ghosts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling even had the urge to use his "talkative clone" to express his opinions on his behalf.</p>

    <p>The summoned Wang Houlang. The appearance is slightly different from Wang Ling. This is not a real clone. It is one level lower than Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. The setting is a sunny, cheerful and mature type.</p>

    <p>"Hello, three of you! My master wants you to investigate Ma Jiao. I don't know. Is there any problem?" At this time, Wang Houlang said.</p>

    <p>"Senior is talking about that little crazy girl?" To be honest, I still have lingering fears in my heart.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this a embarrassment to you? I'm just asking you to investigate. It's not a betrayal of your young master either." Wang Houlang said.</p>

    <p>"It's... ok, but it's okay..." Yitong said with some embarrassment: "But senior has also seen it. That little madwoman is the upper echelon of Golden Core. How can the three of us be her opponents."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about this. I will plant the eight-character mantra in you myself. The effect will be the same as what you saw before."</p>

    <p>Wang Houlang smiled and said: "Once you encounter fatal danger, it will immediately turn into an illusion, allowing you to escape from danger."</p>

    <p>"That's it." The three of them looked at each other and nodded.</p>

    <p>"But my master's time is limited. I will give you 12 hours at most. We need all the information about that classmate Ma Jiao."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Yitong stood up.</p>

    <p>He patted his chest confidently and said, "Senior, just feel free to leave it to us!"</p>

    <p>Then the trio quickly left the dormitory. Wang Ling breathed a sigh of relief. At the same time, the clone named Wang Houlang beside him also disappeared.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was that Wang Ying actually became a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>He appeared directly Wang Ling years ago: "What's the matter? Why don't you tell me about it? I created a chatty clone specifically. Isn't it unnecessary?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling In fact, I have felt that Wang Ying is not suitable for this kind of persuasive work. Although he also has Wang Houlang's chatty attributes, Wang Houlang's tone of obviously discussion makes it easier to negotiate things.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ying is different...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Wang Ling wiped his sweat himself. Why didn't he use Wang Ying... It turned out that Wang Ying didn't have any points himself.</p>

    <p>Just look at Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>It's so "cruel" to treat a girl. How much more to treat other people?</p>

    <p>There is no such thing as talking well. Wang Ying's personality is definitely the type that can do things but not talk.</p>

    <p>And for this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that Wang Ying will suffer a lot sooner or later.</p>

    <p>If you don't control your temper,</p>

    <p>Between him and Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Something big is going to happen later.</p>

    <p>After assigning the task to Yitong, Wang Ling finally had a moment of peace in this messy night.</p>

    <p>In the girls' dormitory in District S of Jiudaohe. Sun Rong looks at each other in the distance in front of the window sill.</p>

    <p>She was always thinking about Wang Ling. She was worried about whether there would be any problems there.</p>

    <p>The weather was getting colder tonight. That feeling of loneliness came to Sun Rong's heart. She originally thought she would go talk to Zhai Yin tonight.</p>

    <p>But now, Zhai and Wang Ming are having an intimate relationship.</p>

    <p>It was really inappropriate for her to just pass by like that.</p>

    <p>The last comfort. It seems that only Sun Ying'er is left: "Rongrong. Go to bed early! Don't think about it!"</p>

    <p>The girl's voice sounded in Sun Rong's ears, speaking softly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was startled. His eyes were slightly absent-minded.</p>

    <p>She leaned against the window for a while. Suddenly she felt warmth on her shoulders.</p>

    <p>Someone covered her with a blanket.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. I'm not cold." At this time, Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>She suddenly felt that Sun Ying'er seemed more considerate than she thought.</p>

    <p>"This... wasn't built by me!" Sun Ying'er was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Not you?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Yes! This blanket is haunted. It flew here on its own..." Sun Ying'er said in a panic at first. Then she quickly realized: "I know! It must be Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>A warm current instantly surged from the body to the girl's face.</p>

    <p>It's a lonely night, yes.</p>

    <p>But also...</p>

    <p>A very nice night.</p>

    <p>It's obviously just an ordinary blanket.</p>

    <p>But the smell above seems to have a special sweetness.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, Sun Rong feels that Wang Ling is very gentle and cruel.</p>

    <p>The young man can always leave his unintentional tenderness to her.</p>

    <p>But it seems...</p>

    <p>Never mind.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head.</p>

    <p>I don't want to think about it any further.</p>

    <p>It's always okay to just spend some more time, right?</p>

    <p>She is fully prepared. Isn't she?</p>

    <p>No matter how many years it is.</p>

    <p>She can afford it.</p>

    <p>Nor will I give up.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It is still the morning of December 16th.</p>

    <p>At about 6 o'clock, Ma Jiao changed into a fresh set of new clothes and returned to her school building in Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>No one knew that just a few hours ago, the student union vice president of Jiudaohe High School "killed three people"...</p>

    <p>Disposing of the bodies of three people was troublesome.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao drove to the back mountain, found an open space, used air blasting to open a small pit, and buried the body in it.</p>

    <p>Then use corpse powder to dissolve the corpses of the three people.</p>

    <p>These corpse powders were originally used to deal with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The amount Ma Jiao carries with her is not that much. But now she needs to dissolve three Golden Cores. Such a dose is far from enough... at most it can only decompose the physical body.</p>

    <p>In other words, there will still be some remains of these three people.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Ma Jiao could only pull the three of them to the back hill behind Jiudaohe High School and deal with them together.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao dug this pit very deep. Unless there is any large-scale mudslide or landslide.</p>

    <p>No one would know that three bodies were buried here.</p>

    <p>Of course. Just in case.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao still took precautions.</p>

    <p>She happens to be a cultivator with wood spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>It is not too difficult to use tree planting to achieve rapid growth of vegetation.</p>

    <p>As long as a few big trees are planted where the bodies are buried, it may be possible to prevent the remains from being discovered.</p>

    <p>And when the tree roots are growing, Ma Jiao can also set them into the shape they want. Through a "claw" posture, they can hold these remains.</p>

    <p>After finishing all this, I returned to the student union. It was already morning.</p>

    <p>She sat in her vice president's seat and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Then he took a pill to cheer him up to prevent himself from looking lazy.</p>

    <p>She has never been a lazy person.</p>

    <p>When Akano Jisaki returned to the student union office, he looked happy.</p>

    <p>This made Ma Jiao couldn't help but feel a little happy: "It was done last night?"</p>

    <p>When she saw Jisaki showing such an expression, she thought Jisaki had completely taken care of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Jisaki smiled. He was as happy as an adolescent pig-headed boy.</p>

    <p>He touched his head and said, "No! Yesterday, classmate Ma Jiao, after you directed all your firepower to classmate Wang Ling, I actually hesitated for a long time. Should I send a message to classmate Sun Rong?" Are you tearing apart the roses in the room... or not? Then that's it. I broke the rose petals all over the floor."</p>

    <p>The corner of Ma Jiao's mouth twitched: "..." I worked so hard all night. I even killed three people. Are you still debating whether to send a text message or not?</p>

    <p>"In the end, did you send it out or not?" Ma Jiao stared at Jisaki. She felt like she had a brain hemorrhage.</p>

    <p>"No! After I finished opening the rose, Sun Rong-chan came to me on his own initiative. He said he wanted to talk to me."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Ma Jiao suddenly spurted out a mouthful of old blood...</p>

    <p>I've been tearing apart the roses all night, but they still haven't been sent out!</p>

    <p>All I can say is, is she worthy of being the president of her family?</p>

    <p>It's really hopeless...</p>

    <p>All this time, Ma Jiao thought Jisaki was just looking stupid.</p>

    <p>At least he is a wise and foolish type.</p>

    <p>But now, Ma Jiao had to take back her thoughts.</p>

    <p>Adolescent boys and girls in love. No one is normal!</p>

    <p>And the most outrageous thing is that Jisaki actually feels very powerful and feels very good about himself.</p>

    <p>He stared at Ma Jiao and laughed, "Well, I didn't expect Sun Rong Jiang to take the initiative to ask me out. Do you think she's interested in me too? I have a feeling I'm not at a disadvantageous position either. I feel like I'm not at a low level. Do I still have a body that automatically attracts beautiful girls?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was silent for a while. Then she felt a headache and rubbed her eyes and temples... She felt that she had to do a set of eye exercises to calm down.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Jisaki will probably be pissed to death.</p>

    <p>"You're lucky not to be given a good person card." After a few minutes of calming down, Ma Jiao reminded him expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>"How come? I'm so good. I don't know how many times better than Houlang Sang." Jisaki smiled.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiaohehe.</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "But this time. Thanks for your help, Ma Jiao, no matter what. Without you. I probably wouldn't have had the courage to tear down the roses. But from the looks of things. I think it's going in the right direction. What do you think of this wave. What floor am I on?"</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was silent again.</p>

    <p>Based on her understanding of girls.</p>

    <p>It is definitely a certainty that Jisaki will be given the good guy card.</p>

    <p>This wave...</p>

    <p>He is obviously in the eighteenth level of hell!</p>

    <p>PS: Who do you think covered the blanket?</p>

    <p>1:Wang Ling</p>

    <p>2:Wang Ying</p>

    <p>3:Unknown ghost...</p>
