  <h1>Chapter 2114 Unexpected Development</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The pain mechanism of {Itinerant Immortal Ring} has always been a highlight of publicity. Although it will not 100% restore the most realistic pain. But when the microcurrent of the holographic cabin penetrates the skin of the user's body, the kind of pain that follows  will give people a sense of immersion.</p>

    <p>There are many fighting elements in high-quality large-scale games. The pursuit of realism and impact in fighting has always been an important indicator for game fans to evaluate the quality.</p>

    <p>However, when this micro-current feedback acted on Wang Ling, the effect was minimal. He could only feel slightly that his chest seemed to be pressed by something.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. This is the effect of the airbag simulation device in the holographic cabin.</p>

    <p>When being hit in the game, Bai Qiao's holographic cabin and the game will not only activate the pain mechanism, but also activate the airbag mechanism based on the part that was hit.</p>

    <p>Simulates the action feedback effects of players being kicked, beaten, kicked, etc...</p>

    <p>It's like Wang Ling being kicked in the chest now. The airbag of this holographic cabin inflated. This feeling is much stronger than the airbag effect of those inflatable massage chairs in the mall!</p>

    <p>Because his physical body is too strong, Wang Ling does not respond much to pain. But the feedback that should be felt can actually be felt.</p>

    <p>The kick from the jailer didn't shake Wang Ling at all. This made him even more angry. He knew that he was being looked down upon.</p>

    <p>The surrounding atmosphere sank to the freezing point with the flickering candlelight. Wang Ling felt a sinister wind eroding the bones. The prison head stopped talking. Even the atmosphere was colder than before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw him turn his back and walked to a certain place in the dark cellar. He pulled out an earthen brick from the clasp of his five fingers.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A terrifying blood-red eye soon appeared. The powerful mental pressure dropped sharply. This was a simulated spiritual pressure mechanism emitted by the holographic cabin. It was very real. But it still had little effect on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling finally knows what [unknown plot] he triggered. It turns out that the prison boss raised a monster in the dark cellar...</p>

    <p>Yes. This is a demonic beast. It is not a spiritual beast. The spiritual power emitted by a spiritual beast is essentially different from that of a demonic beast. It is a colder spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Of course, not all monsters in the monster world are hostile to humans. But the more ferocious the monsters, the colder the spiritual power in their bodies, giving people a feeling of coldness like frost.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling didn't feel the feedback from the holographic cabin, he saw that his health was dropping at a speed visible to the naked eye. It looked like he could lose one drop of blood in two seconds.</p>

    <p>But it's okay. He's over 790 now. It's enough to last ten minutes.</p>

    <p>"Blood slave! Eat him!" Soon, the prison leader gave an order to the monster trapped in the wall.</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>A dark purple vine poked out from the gap.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's figure did not move. He did not dodge or move. He was not frightened by the rattan either.</p>

    <p>He saw that this dark purple rattan turned transparent and passed across his body.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that Wang Ling's judgment was correct.</p>

    <p>Because this vine is just an illusion.</p>

    <p>The monster inside wants to use illusions to force Wang Ling to move, thereby making Wang Ling fall within its attack range.</p>

    <p>But generally speaking, you need to rely on illusions to force you out of position.</p>

    <p>This means that the opponent's shooting range is simply not enough.</p>

    <p>This monster was originally kept in a wall by the cell leader. Since it was so restricted, its original attack range would definitely be affected.</p>

    <p>Thinking about it this way, Wang Ling feels that it is completely reasonable.</p>

    <p>The truth only lies within range.</p>

    <p>In other words, if you are outside the range, it means you can do whatever you want...</p>

    <p>As long as you can stand firm and don't take another step forward, there is nothing this monster can do against you.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling standing quietly on the spot. He didn't appear to be disturbed by illusions at all.</p>

    <p>The prison chief was obviously a little anxious: "Don't you feel it! Your cultivation is weakening! Even if you stand still, you are still going to die!"</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth. These words sounded a bit like a threat.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was not afraid at all. He stood there, picked his ears, and started to shake his legs.</p>

    <p>Shaking your legs is a bad habit. But if you shake your legs when you're bored, it's quite exciting.</p>

    <p>This is all the result of Wang Ling being brought out by Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of the prison boss, such behavior is undoubtedly disrespectful.</p>

    <p>"Good boy, you have the guts! If you have the guts, just stay there and don't move. I will turn you into a mummy later!" He was furious. But there was nothing he could do with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The more anxious Wang Ling feels, the more it illustrates the problem.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the other party's purpose is just to kill himself. So since he is bound to die sooner or later, why does he have to watch this monster?</p>

    <p>Thought again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gradually understood everything.</p>

    <p>Right now, his health has been reduced over time to a value similar to that of the cell leader.</p>

    <p>And it was precisely because he had not come closer that the cell leader became even more panicked.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the prison chief would not have thought that the young man in front of him could have such determination.</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ling's health was about to equal that of the prison leader. Wang Ling could see that the prison leader was in a hurry. He began to use the bricks he had just dug out to block the connection port of the monster beast.</p>

    <p>But obviously, it is too late to make this decision now.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A claw protruded directly from the gap. It transferred the piece in the prison head's hand and crushed it to pieces!</p>

    <p>A very hungry monster. The increase in power is also immense.</p>

    <p>The health of this cell leader is only 100 points. Every time he brought lynched prisoners here to feed him, he never fought back. But this time... is an exception!</p>

    <p>The moment the bricks were smashed by the monster inside the wall, Wang Ling had already seen the ending of this cell leader.</p>

    <p>Especially now that his health is lower than that of the prison boss.</p>

    <p>Who to choose as food... becomes a very clear choice.</p>

    <p>The next second.</p>

    <p>The ruthless hunting claws of the monster in the wall poked out directly from the gaps in the bricks. They grabbed the prison head's head upside down and turned his entire head around like a screw.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw something like a rhizome extending down the claws of the monster. It pierced the blood vessels of the prison head and began to eat away the blood in his body until it drained him completely.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The above description was written on the spot by Wang Ling based on the mosaic in front of him and the novel writing ability inherited from Father Wang.</p>

    <p>He didn't know the specific situation. Anyway, it was in a mosaic. The cell leader died directly... All that was left in front of him was a cell head armor, a storage bag and a cell head. helmet.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a game for everyone.</p>

    <p>There is no gore in this game. It would never pass the review!</p>

    <p>After eating and drinking enough, the monsters inside the wall naturally had no intention of continuing to persecute Wang Ling. Wang Ling walked straight over without fear.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it.</p>

    <p>Then he put the cell head outfit on himself...</p>
