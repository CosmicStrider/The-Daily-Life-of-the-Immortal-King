  <h1>Chapter 1733 Find an excuse for the union</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was finally Jingke's turn to appear. When he appeared in front of Wang Ling, he felt as if he had been dusted for a long time.</p>

    <p>He hasn't been idle these days. Because of Bai Qiao, he has a lot of calluses on his hands.</p>

    <p>This was obtained while playing games with Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, he couldn't refuse Bai Qiao's invitation. On the other hand, he also wanted to enhance his relationship with Bai Qiao through games.</p>

    <p>There are many fused creatures in front of me. They are densely packed and cover the entire sky.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong rushed into the brood nest on the motorcycle transformed by Aohai, Jingke also used force at the same time to clear the way for Sun Rong and Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A trace of brown sword energy emerged. At first it was only as big as a leaf, floating in Jingke's palm. Then when he struck out with his palm, it instantly rose into the sky, forming a beam of light and blasting out.</p>

    <p>This sword energy came with great force. The synthetic creatures around him didn't even have time to react when they were exposed to the sword energy. They were completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>The synthetic creatures of the dragon and old Japanese bloodlines are indeed not the same as the normal earth spirit beasts. These synthetic creatures are very lethal. A month or two ago, Jingke felt that his combat power was not enough to compete with these synthetic creatures.</p>

    <p>But now. Everything is different.</p>

    <p>Since Bai Qiao returned and Wang Ling taught him how to practice, his combat power has grown greatly compared to before.</p>

    <p>And sometimes he can learn some new abilities while teaching Leng Ming. It perfectly explains what "teaching and learning" means.</p>

    <p>After using sword energy to successfully escort Sun Rong and Wang Ming in, Jingke immediately flicked his finger and completely sealed the hole in the laboratory with sword energy.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The synthetic creatures all over the sky roared in anger.</p>

    <p>These dragon-bearded monsters possess certain intelligence. They know that if they want to prevent further destruction in the laboratory, they must defeat the sword spirit in front of them.</p>

    <p>Rapidly!</p>

    <p>The mental pressure of these dragon-bearded monsters was concentrated on one point and pressed on Jingke's shoulders.</p>

    <p>Jingke's figure did not move. His small body withstood the pressure of thousands of synthetic creatures. He still maintained his calm posture. It only made his body sink slightly in this reddish-brown land.</p>

    <p>"Jie Jie" In the sky, these synthetic creatures made weird laughter.</p>

    <p>Then the tentacles on their bodies began to extend. Thick green mucus overflowed from the suckers, and then they were all connected to each other...</p>

    <p>"It can be synthesized? Are you kidding? Synthetic watermelon?" This scene made Heavenly Dao stunned.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the old Japanese creatures give people this extremely mysterious feeling.</p>

    <p>He saw the extending tentacles entangled with each other and merged into one amidst the "sizzling" sliding sound of green mucus. He couldn't help but feel a nausea in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then, the originally scattered creatures quickly gathered together and condensed into a huge dragon-shaped creature!</p>

    <p>The synthesized giant dragon bearded monster is hundreds of meters tall. It waves the dragon wings composed of tentacles on its back. Its claws and tail are all huge tentacles.</p>

    <p>With a casual breath, a mouthful of green old phlegm was spat out. It was highly corrosive. The waterfall generally covered the direction of Wang Ling, covering Wang Ling and others in all directions. There was no way to escape at all.</p>

    <p>Jingke's eyes were extremely calm. He raised his sword fingers and flicked his sleeves across the void.</p>

    <p>"Want to cut with sword energy? Haha..." The giant dragon-bearded monster spoke. This was a voice that sounded directly in Jingke's mind. It was transmitted through some mysterious spiritual power.</p>

    <p>It seemed to have expected that Jingke would use his sword energy to defend himself. The moment Jingke took action, it let out a mocking cry of success.</p>

    <p>As a product of the combination of old Japanese creatures and dragon creatures, its abilities are naturally full of mystery and domineering. It cannot be compared with ordinary cultivation spells on earth.</p>

    <p>The special substance contained in this green pus can be transformed into sword energy.</p>

    <p>Not only will it not be cut off and evaporated by the sword energy, but it will form hundreds of millions of dense pus beads in an instant, covering them like acid rain. The more it is divided by the sword energy, the greater the coverage density of the pus beads!</p>

    <p>It is simply unavoidable!</p>

    <p>The giant dragon-bearded monster thought that his plot had succeeded. While he was laughing sinisterly, he saw that the appearance of the sword spirit in front of him seemed to have changed slightly.</p>

    <p>The little body became taller. Even the hair became longer. He transformed from a child-like little sword spirit into a stern young man who is still childish but looks hard to mess with.</p>

    <p>"You want to dance in front of me with this little strength?" Jingbai opened his eyes and sneered, staring at the dragon-bearded monster several hundred meters tall in the void.</p>

    <p>He flicked his sleeves again. The powerful brown sword energy was actually mixed with a hint of green!</p>

    <p>As the Lord of the Sword King Realm, he can freely mobilize the sword energy of any spiritual sword in the Sword King Realm for his own use!</p>

    <p>And this green sword energy is the combination of the sword energy of "Yu" and "Leng Ming!" It has a powerful purifying power!</p>

    <p>At the same time as this sword energy collided with the green pus, even though the pus differentiated into more pus beads at the same time, the corrosive substances inside were also purified completely. It was filtered to be extremely clean on the spot.</p>

    <p>"You are so small-minded. Are you here to embarrass yourself in front of me?"</p>

    <p>Jingbai chuckled. "Do you think you are the only one who can synthesize it?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Heavenly Dao remained silent.</p>

    <p>They see through it completely without saying anything.</p>

    <p>In fact, with Jingke's current strength, it is no problem to deal with this giant dragon-bearded monster.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling discovered that there is something wrong with Jingke now.</p>

    <p>They just try to find excuses for "integration" every time...</p>

    <p>Including before. And several times!</p>

    <p>It's obvious that Jingke can beat him in his form. He has to pretend that he can't beat him. Then he chooses to merge with Bai Qiao...</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he has changed.</p>

    <p>At least in Wang Ling's eyes he has changed...</p>

    <p>Ever since I found Bai Qiao, I feel like I feel uncomfortable all over if I don't fit in one day.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know if it's his imagination.</p>

    <p>I feel that Jingke is doing this in disguise... to show affection?</p>

    <p>And it seems to be reminding him secretly. Even Sword Spirit has a partner. Why doesn't he have a partner yet?</p>

    <p>Good couple...</p>

    <p>It turns out that this is waiting for him here...</p>

    <p>At this time, the corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. He soon regained his composure.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to fall in love.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for him to fall in love in this life...</p>

    <p>And even if one day he really falls in love.</p>

    <p>It is also impossible to fall in love with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The rabbit still won't eat the grass beside the nest!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong, who had successfully invaded the laboratory, suddenly sneezed hard.</p>

    <p>"Are you okay? Is it because you have a cold? But you should...not have a cold now." Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, Brother Ming. Maybe someone is scolding me?"</p>

    <p>"Heh. That's not necessarily true. Maybe I miss you..."</p>
