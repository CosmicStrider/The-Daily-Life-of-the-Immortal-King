  <h1>Chapter 2118 Wang Ling is just a child</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The latest website: Wang Ling is very clear. The person in front of me is not Chen Chao. It is just an NPC modeled after Chen Chao's appearance. But I don't know why General Chen said to Wang Ling with a lewd expression. When it happened, this expression really deserved a beating.</p>

    <p>He is in Chen Chao's face, but his behavior is completely different from Chen Chao's. Although Chen Chao occasionally behaves like a gentleman, he is always a gentleman behind his back.</p>

    <p>Adolescent boys will more or less have some little secrets stored in their mobile phones.</p>

    <p>Wang LingOf course there are.</p>

    <p>As for what the secret is... eh... no one will know!</p>

    <p>So what about in reality? People with almost the same appearance but completely different personalities do exist.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that when he saw Chen Chao's face, he would be able to make up his mind easily. He regarded General Chen as Chen Chao. But in fact, when he discovered that this so-called "General Chen" was completely different from Chen Chao After the character. Wang Ling felt at ease.</p>

    <p>There was a voice telling him that this person was not the Chen Chao he knew...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard that Bai Qiao compiled almost every villain in the Itinerant Immortal ring with real information. Many of these villains originated from real life.</p>

    <p>As for the story information, it was provided by Warden Liang of Songhai City Number 1 Prison. The purpose is to educate, entertain and popularize the law in the game.</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter how the next script goes, whether Wang Ling will get more or less benefits. Judging from Wang Ling's understanding of the direction of General Chen's story, it should not be much better.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling is still indifferent to things between men and women. He is just a child...I don't understand why so many people are obsessed with the beauty of others.</p>

    <p>Seeing the reserved look of Wang Ling, General Chen also laughed loudly: "Old Wu! You are the same as before! You are still the same! You are a lot older. You don't even have a wife. Isn't it a shame? .My new concubine. One child and ten treasures. Good guy, it's a lively scene in the backyard."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As a child, Wang Ling also didn't understand. There is really such an operation as one child with ten babies.</p>

    <p>For a moment, he felt a strong desire to complain, but he didn't know where to start.</p>

    <p>At this moment, an untimely knock on the door suddenly sounded, breaking the silence in the main hall.</p>

    <p>"Who! Don't you know that I am chatting with my brother Wu?" General Chen was furious. He stood up from his desk.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the shadow of the person outside the door retreating. First it shrank into a ball, and then gradually enlarged. As if mustering up courage, he said in a small voice: "General, it's time to drink medicine." .."</p>

    <p>"Drink medicine?" Wang Ling looked at General Chen suspiciously.</p>

    <p>"Ahem. This is why Brother Wu doesn't understand. Brother Wu doesn't have a nightlife, but that doesn't mean I don't have one." As he said that, he stood up and opened the door with a raised hand.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling's eyes focused again. They were looking at the steaming bowl of soup and medicine brought by the subordinate.</p>

    <p>A line of eye-catching game text description also caught Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>There are a few big characters written on it [Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine Flavored Rehmannia Pills]</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling understood instantly and raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>After all, the setting is for this age...</p>

    <p>In addition, there are three wives and four concubines in the backyard. It is indeed difficult to take turns taking care of them.</p>

    <p>Let alone taking care of seven. Sometimes when people reach middle age, it is quite difficult to take care of just one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembers that Father Wang and Mother Wang have been teaching him correctly how to use his abilities since he can remember. It is clear that Wang Ling can transform the spiritual roots of two people and turn them into serious people. And he is also a talented cultivator.</p>

    <p>But Father Wang and Mother Wang still refused. They told him the importance of letting nature take its course...</p>

    <p>The only time he made an exception was when he was transitioning from elementary school to junior high school. Father Wang found him and asked him if he could use his invincible powers to find a way...</p>

    <p>When I reach middle age, I also stay up late to catch up on manuscripts. Hair loss and lumbar muscle soreness often occur. At this time, if there is no supplement support, I am afraid that no one can survive.</p>

    <p>Besides, Father Wang wasn't as popular as it is now...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is still a child. I don't know what Father Wang's specific needs are, so I made a big tonic pill for Father Wang.</p>

    <p>As for Father Wang, he didn't dare to eat them all...</p>

    <p>He was afraid that he would ascend and evolve directly after eating it.</p>

    <p>Just a light lick.</p>

    <p>That night, there were frequent earthquakes in the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Only little Wang Ling looked confused.</p>

    <p>He's just a kid...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Back to the topic. Although Wang Ling, who has grown up now, is still a child, he is not ignorant of this aspect.</p>

    <p>The school has physiology classes. In addition, there are a few very precocious friends in each class. After asking around, it all became clear.</p>

    <p>"Every day, I live for this bowl!"</p>

    <p>Picking up the medicine bowl, General Chen felt full of satisfaction just by smelling the decoction made from precious immortal herbs.</p>

    <p>Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine flavored rehmannia pills... The soup in this bowl is radiant when you bring it up to you. It can be seen that it contains the essence of countless precious herbs.</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that in the next second, two naughty children suddenly came out of the courtyard and passed directly across the courtyard. Although they were still young, they both had faces that were almost the same as Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Two children of seven or eight years old ran after each other. They accidentally broke into this place while laughing. Then one of them accidentally fell while running. A heavy blow with a heavy hammer and sparks directly hit General Chen's vital part.</p>

    <p>No matter how powerful a general is, how can he withstand such a critical blow?</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>In just a moment, the precious bowl of soup was shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>Seeing such a happy scene of a loving father and a filial son. Wang Ling was messy in the wind. It felt like I was watching a sitcom.</p>

    <p>Then something he never expected happened.</p>

    <p>General Chen's face began to darken. Even his cheeks sank rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at him with confusion on his face.</p>

    <p>At this time, the NPC subordinate next to him sighed: "General, he has always been relying on this tonic... How can this be good..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>Isn't this just a matter of not having a meal... As for being malnourished and being squeezed into a mummy!</p>

    <p>And judging from the current situation, this is not just going to be a mummy!</p>

    <p>This is going to...die on the spot!</p>

    <p>"Brother Wu..."</p>

    <p>At this time, General Chen clenched his sleeve.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>General Chen: "My three wives and four concubines...and eighteen children...will be left to you..."</p>

    <p>After saying that. www.uukanshu.net He died directly.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't understand. But he was shocked.</p>

    <p>He is still just a child!</p>

    <p>Why should you help others take care of their wives and children?</p>

    <p>Even if it's the plot in the game, this is outrageous!</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw a new system prompt popping up in front of him.</p>

    <p>[System: You have obtained a new identity (General Chen of Fuyun Town)]</p>

    <p>...</p>
