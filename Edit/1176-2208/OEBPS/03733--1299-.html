  <h1>Chapter 1299 What is the equivalent of ten lifetimes of cultivation?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"As expected of a master. He can even switch to a place like this..."</p>

    <p>In Office of Strategic Deception, the screen projected by Jin Deng simultaneously switches to this god-forsaken place.</p>

    <p>Everyone stared at the souls of the six Dao Gods. They were once again shocked by the monk's methods.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled slightly, "When the poor monk hit these Dao Gods with his head hammer, he used a consecration technique to illuminate their retinas while they were unconscious. That's why we can capture the current scene."</p>

    <p>Flexible use of {Consecration Technique} can create a certain connection between the objects being consecrated and the monks...</p>

    <p>So now the monk can switch to a total of 6 perspectives to observe this god-forsaken place.</p>

    <p>And now the perspective that everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception sees is the perspective of the head of the Wu family.</p>

    <p>In fact, the monk has always had a wish. That is to complete a historical documentary recording the rise and fall of the divine realm.</p>

    <p>This will serve as a warning to cultivators on earth. In order to better promote the culture of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Use {Open Light Technique} to invade the retinas of these Dao Gods. This is for this purpose.</p>

    <p>"I still don't understand. Why doesn't Dao God have a life-saving magic weapon on him?" At this time, Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>He even has a soul-suppressing ring given to him by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As long as he is seriously injured, he can be resurrected without limit.</p>

    <p>"Because the person who killed them was Ling Zhenren. Therefore, the life-saving magic weapon has no effect at all."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "They died at the speed of light under the force of Ling Zhenren's fingers. So fast that even they themselves could not react. Even those life-saving magic weapons may be in a state of confusion."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master!"Zhuo Yi exclaimed!</p>

    <p>This is what is called, as long as you die quickly enough, the life-saving magic weapon will not be able to react...</p>

    <p>"Normal cultivators die. Generally, the soul will not be damaged. And the resurrection mechanism of life-saving magic weapons is mostly based on this. By copying the incomplete cells, the body is reshaped for the soul that has lost the body to achieve the purpose of resurrection."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "However, Ling Zhenren's finger strength was too strong. When he pinched it, the six Dao Gods were destroyed. In other words, these people are in the realm of Dao God. If it had been anyone else, there would have been no hope."</p>

    <p>"Then what exactly is this place abandoned by gods?"</p>

    <p>"You can understand it as the VIP mourning hall specially created by Dao Ancestor Wang back then."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"As long as they reach the state of Dao God, their souls can have a backup in the land abandoned by God."</p>

    <p>"In other words, their original souls have actually been pinched by the master?"</p>

    <p>"That's it."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>This god-forsaken place. The monk remembered that he had visited it once in order to find out the truth about whether Dao Ancestor Wang was still alive.</p>

    <p>But he wasn't killed by someone else.</p>

    <p>Instead, he transcended himself.</p>

    <p>As a result, after entering the land abandoned by the gods, he was somewhat disappointed.</p>

    <p>There are no clues about Dao Ancestor Wang here.</p>

    <p>And the most troublesome thing is the pillar spirit in this god-forsaken land.</p>

    <p>If we evaluate it in the words of a monk.</p>

    <p>This Zhu Ling is an iron fool with no need for emotion.</p>

    <p>In other words, it is actually very difficult for these six Dao Gods to bargain with the Abandoned Pillar of Gods.</p>

    <p>The monk had already received the teaching once before.</p>

    <p>But his cultivation level is profound. Besides, he had to transcend himself that time.</p>

    <p>So the deduction for cultivation is not much.</p>

    <p>There are only 10 lives in total.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the combat power of a monk in his heyday was actually a total of 3920 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>What is the approximate concept of cultivation in the 10th life?</p>

    <p>According to the current average state data of cultivators on the earth.</p>

    <p>The life of a cultivator...</p>

    <p>The most talented people can cultivate to the state of Itinerant Immortal or True Immortal in just one life.</p>

    <p>However, such cultivators are in the minority. Calculated based on the global population, less than 1%</p>

    <p>If we take the average value, a cultivator can achieve Soul Formation on average in one lifetime.</p>

    <p>It's almost on the level of Lord Diulei who doesn't eat Heavenly Dao broccoli.</p>

    <p>So the cultivation level of 10 lives. That is ten Lord Diulei who do not eat Heavenly Dao broccoli...</p>

    <p>Of course, this is still the monk's conservative estimate of the loss of cultivation.</p>

    <p>After all, the monk himself is a rare talent.</p>

    <p>His actual losses must be greater than they appear on paper.</p>

    <p>Of course, the monk would not say these words to his face.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I was afraid of hurting Lord Diulei's heart...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A place abandoned by gods. Following the poor and failed acting skills of the head of the Wu family, he was sentenced to a punishment of 100 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But this is not the final judgment because he has not yet "paid" for his cultivation.</p>

    <p>So there is still room for bargaining.</p>

    <p>100 lifetimes of cultivation. The head of the Wu family simply cannot afford such a loss...</p>

    <p>Even if it's half broken.</p>

    <p>50 lives are easier to accept than 100 lives.</p>

    <p>"My lords, please first... I will go to the side to confess for a while..." The head of the Wu family was helpless. He could only wave his sleeves and continue to shed tears on the side.</p>

    <p>Then he knelt on the ground and burst into tears as if mourning.</p>

    <p>Kneel down with great piety.</p>

    <p>This time, he seemed really repentant. And really sad...</p>

    <p>Any hypocrisy will not work in front of the pillar spirit of the Pillar of God's Abandonment.</p>

    <p>After seeing the failure of the head of the Wu family, the remaining families began to devise their own methods.</p>

    <p>So. The head of the Li family stepped forward at this time.</p>

    <p>He took the gentle route.</p>

    <p>"Lord Zhu Ling. I sincerely repent and admit my mistake. I hope Lord Zhu Ling can be merciful and give less punishment... If I have a chance to come to this god-forsaken place next time, I can bring you some gifts to relieve my worries. The loneliness of being alone in Huaxiu, a place abandoned by God..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the head of the Li family bowed to the Pillar of God's Abandonment and then touched it with his hand.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling finally gave the punishment result: "You will be punished for 99 lifetimes of cultivation to return to the world..."</p>

    <p>The Huairou route seems to work.</p>

    <p>But this reduced sentence is a bit too little...</p>

    <p>"This only reduces one life. It is better not to reduce..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family complained while letting go of his hand with a disappointed look on his face.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling: "Then I will continue to punish you for 100 lifetimes of cultivation..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family quickly covered his mouth. He wanted to cry but had no tears.</p>

    <p>The head of the Zhao family has obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

    <p>Before he touched the Pillar of God's Abandonment, he deliberately wiped the Pillar of God's Abandonment inside and out to show his sincerity.</p>

    <p>"Lord Zhu Ling. Look... you haven't been touched in years. It's accumulated too much..."</p>

    <p>When the head of the Zhao family said this, he realized that there might be some ambiguity in his words. He quickly added: "Master Zhu Ling, don't get me wrong. What I mean is accumulation of dust... You have accumulated a lot of dust! I hope Master Zhu Ling will be merciful." If you come here again next time, I will definitely wipe you down..."</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling: "I will punish you for 80 lifetimes of cultivation..."</p>

    <p>This penalty made the head of the Zhao family breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>With the experience of the head of the Li family, he did not dare to talk back. Moreover, he did not continue to bargain.</p>

    <p>He just nodded quickly: "I'm willing to accept the punishment!"</p>

    <p>Then, the Pillar of Divine Abandonment emitted a ray of light, hitting the head of the Zhao family.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the spirit of the head of the Zhao family disappeared on the spot.</p>

    <p>His soul was liberated. The Pillar of God's Abandonment helped the head of the Zhao family rebuild Dao God's physical body.</p>

    <p>The remaining five Dao Gods were all confused.</p>

    <p>They never expected that the head of the Zhao family would accept this "punishment of eighty generations of cultivation" so simply.</p>

    <p>"This old Zhao... slipped away fast enough..."</p>

    <p>"This is my 80th life! I will never leave without counter-offering for less than 50 lives!"</p>

    <p>The voices of several family heads discussing could be heard in the God-Forsaken Land.</p>

    <p>At this time, the head of the Wu family who was previously punished for 100 lives seemed to be inspired by the head of the Zhao family.</p>

    <p>He also hurriedly ran over and knelt down to wipe the body of the god pillar.</p>

    <p>As a result, God Spirit Column became furious and said: "It's you acting grandson again. I'm almost going to be bald by you...150 lives!"</p>

    <p>"150 lives! Just arrange for me to be reincarnated!" The head of the Wu family couldn't bear it.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to be reincarnated? No problem..."</p>

    <p>The pillar spirit of the Pillar of God's Abandonment had a calm voice.</p>

    <p>The head of the Wu family knelt down again. He crazily kowtowed to the Spirit Column: "Master Zhu Ling! I was wrong! I was really wrong!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time. Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal in the main hall.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei suddenly became curious: "Can God Spirit Column really help him reincarnate directly?"</p>

    <p>"Okay." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>"If this were reincarnation, who could he be reincarnated into?" Everyone was curious.</p>

    <p>"He just knelt three times. Maybe it will turn into... Wu San kneeling?" Zhuo Yi said in shock.</p>

    <p>People around: "..."</p>
