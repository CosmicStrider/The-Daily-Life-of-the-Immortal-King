  <h1>Chapter 1312 Wang Nuan's self-defense mechanism</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a typical murder caused by low self-esteem.</p>

    <p>In this age where faces are valued, even mythical beasts may feel inferior, let alone human cultivators.</p>

    <p>According to scientific data statistics in the cultivation world, if the longevity is the same, the income of a good-looking person in his lifetime will be 18% more than that of an average-looking person...</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist has been maintaining his brutal persona for many years. But he didn't expect that he would be exposed by King's Eyes all of a sudden. His persona would completely collapse.</p>

    <p>Oh!</p>

    <p>I will not avenge this!</p>

    <p>He swore not to be a beast!</p>

    <p>In the gray fog, the groundhog made a voice: "I still need your help in this matter. I need you to lead him out of the earth."</p>

    <p>He has already thought of ways to torture Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But if he chooses to do it on Earth, the restrictions left by Dao Ancestor will have a certain impact on his strength.</p>

    <p>So the groundhog decided to fight somewhere other than Earth.</p>

    <p>Only in this way can his strength be fully highlighted.</p>

    <p>"Senior is joking. We don't have any ability to seduce the one on the earth...Senior is very capable. As long as we launch an attack in the direction of the earth, I believe that the one on the earth will respond quickly." Power Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist nodded.</p>

    <p>And he was inspired by the words of the powerful Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>It's all because of the restrictions set by Dao Ancestor on this earth. Therefore, he has been unable to use his fists on earth.</p>

    <p>Then if he just wipes out the entire earth, wouldn't this problem disappear?</p>

    <p>At this moment, the groundhog was overjoyed.</p>

    <p>He regretted that he had not thought of this method earlier!</p>

    <p>As long as the earth disappears!</p>

    <p>Then the last place in the universe that could limit his strength would completely disappear.</p>

    <p>Then he can really do whatever he wants!</p>

    <p>"I'll do it now!" the groundhog became excited.</p>

    <p>His figure quickly escaped and disappeared into the gray mist.</p>

    <p>The gray mist penetrated into space and formed a torrent, which quickly brought him to the moon and looked far away from the earth.</p>

    <p>Then, he raised his claws and condensed the power of chaos from the gray mist.</p>

    <p>The traces of chaotic power condensed into a purple and black ball from the tip of his claws.</p>

    <p>But it's only the size of an egg.</p>

    <p>But it hides amazing power.</p>

    <p>When this chaotic sphere condensed, large chunks of the ground on the moon's surface collapsed. The explosive pressure of the chaotic sphere made the ground where the groundhog stood deeply dented!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A deep pit with a radius exceeding a thousand miles was instantly formed!</p>

    <p>Moon.</p>

    <p>This is the best sniping position. It is also the best turret for launching Chaos Sphere!</p>

    <p>Because of the existence of the moon. This provides huge recoil support for the prairie dog!</p>

    <p>This magic ball is not the entire power of Lord Gray Mist. The concentration of the power of chaos in his body is 35%, which is 30% higher than that of ordinary divine beasts.</p>

    <p>And this is also the main reason why prairie dogs have always done whatever they want and are arrogant.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Sphere in his hand now has only condensed 5% of its power. But if it were launched, it would reach the core of the earth and detonate the earth. It would be enough.</p>

    <p>"Farewell. Earth."</p>

    <p>The groundhog sneered.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand a little! There was another huge roar!</p>

    <p>At the tip of the claw, an egg-sized chaos sphere was released instantly!</p>

    <p>The huge recoil caused the moon under the groundhog's feet to move backward several hundred meters.</p>

    <p>The earth is going to disappear.</p>

    <p>Once the forbidden area that can finally control him disappears, no one can control him anymore!</p>

    <p>The groundhog stood on the moon, admiring his masterpiece from a distance.</p>

    <p>After being launched, the chaos sphere is heading towards the earth at the speed of light!</p>

    <p>--Art is explosion!</p>

    <p>I can witness the destruction of this blue planet with my own eyes.</p>

    <p>Such a picture must be beautiful!</p>

    <p>If this move succeeds, only two people may survive on this land.</p>

    <p>One is the monk.</p>

    <p>And the other one... is the hateful guy who spied out his true identity!</p>

    <p>Even if these two people are not dead.</p>

    <p>He must have been seriously injured under the impact of the Chaos Sphere.</p>

    <p>If we can take the opportunity to get rid of these two people...hehehehe...no one in this universe can restrict him anymore!</p>

    <p>However, what Mr. Gray Mist didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>At the moment when the chaos sphere is about to approach the earth.</p>

    <p>A terrible accident happened suddenly!</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" The groundhog felt strange.</p>

    <p>Because he felt an inexplicable and huge pressure suddenly surged on him!</p>

    <p>And soon, he realized where this something strange was coming from.</p>

    <p>"Shadow?" The groundhog was shocked!</p>

    <p>He was surprised to find that the huge shadow on the back of the moon, for some unknown reason, suddenly seemed to be endowed with a huge spiritual force and gathered towards his feet!</p>

    <p>These shadows flowed from the back of the moon to his feet like a tide. Then they continued to gather, forming a powerful quagmire! Catch him firmly!</p>

    <p>Then it flooded his body!</p>

    <p>"Shadow binding?" Faced with such an unexpected situation, the groundhog was horrified.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the ordinary shadow binding technique. Even Heavenly Dao's big shadow technique does not have such ability!</p>

    <p>He could actually mobilize the entire shadow on the back of the moon to bind him in a brief moment!</p>

    <p>These shadows crawled towards his feet, then wrapped around his claws, forcibly controlling him to interrupt the "Chaos Sphere" that was about to detonate the earth!</p>

    <p>"There is a ghost here!" The groundhog was frightened.</p>

    <p>This is the first time he has encountered such a situation.</p>

    <p>"Is this also a kind of Dao-level power? It exists side by side with Heavenly Dao?" Soon, he thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>Only this explanation can explain why there is an ability that can instantly mobilize the power of the entire shadow on the back of the moon.</p>

    <p>At this time, the prairie dog opened his gray mist!</p>

    <p>Such an unexpected situation caught him by surprise. However, it would still be a bit of a fantasy to restrain him.</p>

    <p>Although it is not easy to break free from the shackles of the shadow, it is mainly because it is the first time for the prairie dog to encounter this kind of power. It is caused by the unfamiliarity.</p>

    <p>Quickly, he manipulated the gray fog around him to shred the shadows wrapped around his feet and body. He got rid of the restraints and quickly left the moon.</p>

    <p>And the moment he was far away.</p>

    <p>These shadows that surged up from the back of the moon instantly ebbed and returned to their original positions.</p>

    <p>Although this is the first time I have come into contact with such great power.</p>

    <p>But now the prairie dog can be sure intuitively.</p>

    <p>This great power comes from the earth.</p>

    <p>"Besides the monk and the screen-peeping dog, are there any other masters?"</p>

    <p>The groundhog stared in the direction of the earth. He felt interesting in his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"That's my sister."</p>

    <p>But at this moment, a cold voice sounded from the groundhog's soul.</p>

    <p>A young man appeared from behind him.</p>

    <p>Wearing a red and white casual sportswear, he was staring at him with one hand in his trouser pocket.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment the prairie dog's chaos sphere was launched.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is already planning to take action.</p>

    <p>However, what Wang Ling did not expect was.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because I feel that the earth is under threat.</p>

    <p>This actually activated Wang Nuan's self-defense mechanism!</p>

    <p>This girl is clearly still in her belly. She can actually control the shadow on the far side of the moon.</p>

    <p>Then forcefully use shadow to control the groundhog to interrupt the Chaos Sphere.</p>

    <p>She is indeed his sister!</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan is awesome!</p>
