  <h1>Chapter 1887 It was clearly arranged</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Sun Rong came up with this plan of disguising herself as a man on her own initiative. But when it was her turn to go into battle, she was still a little hesitant and nervous.</p>

    <p>After all, many boys have no experience in proposing marriage. What's more, she is a girl? And she doesn't know why. She feels that doing this is a bit weird.</p>

    <p>Although her original intention was to prevent Wang Ling from proposing marriage... uh no. Her original intention was to preserve the relationship between Sun Ying'er and Wang Ying. It was for the sake of justice! But it was not Wang Ling who proposed marriage. That's right. But it was she who got married in the end!</p>

    <p>She's got herself into a trap!</p>

    <p>After realizing this, Sun Rong even felt a little regretful. She felt that she had been reckless after all... and this matter was of great importance. Because the success or failure of the marriage proposal would directly affect the historical trajectory of human cultivators. If a little mistake was made. She would be the sinner of history.</p>

    <p>This heavy pressure made her breathless. She kept taking deep breaths on the way to the Peng family headquarters.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and You Yueqing pretended to be maids and were by her side. In the absence of King Tiankun, they did not have to force themselves to maintain the snake shape. Their legs were directly differentiated and were no different from ordinary people.</p>

    <p>"Why are you getting nervous now that the critical moment is approaching?" Liu Qingyi asked with a smile. She comforted her by saying, "It doesn't have to be a heavy burden. It's just acting."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong understood the truth. But self-reflection is normal for people. And the more outstanding people are, the more so.</p>

    <p>She was so nervous that even the muscles in her stomach ached. She also felt full of regret. She thought that if she had listened to Wang Ling and not intervened in this matter, maybe the matter would never have reached this point.</p>

    <p>Now the turning point of history has been handed over to her. If she messes up... she is really worried that the friendship value between Wang Ling will directly fall below the historical freezing point.</p>

    <p>It was obviously not easy for her to come into contact with Wang Ling at this level...</p>

    <p>At this time, thoughts were flying in Sun Rong's mind. When she was thinking endlessly, she never thought that the other person who was comforting her at this time was actually You Yueqing, who she had always regarded as a person who was on high alert.</p>

    <p>"Don't think too much at this time. Do you think it's your fault that things have become complicated? All of this is just a design. Including you recruiting so many people to decipher the mysterious text and accidentally falling. Entering this eternal world, everything has been designed."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing looked at Sun Rong calmly and said: "We are actually just chess pieces used by these powerful seniors to play games. Since we are chess pieces, we only need to implement the plan step by step. Besides, why did Ling Ling agree to let you go? You didn't think about it at all?"</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong suddenly raised her head. The expression on her face was somewhat frozen.</p>

    <p>Yes. Such an important task is no child's play. Why did Wang Ling agree so simply to let her carry it out?</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong began to understand something in a daze under You Yueqing's advice.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling trusts you. That's why I entrust you with such an important matter." At this time, You Yueqing looked at Sun Rong seriously and said.</p>

    <p>At the same time, when she saw the surprised look in Sun Rong's eyes, she suddenly felt funny: "What? You look at me in such shock. You think I will go out of your way to comfort you. Isn't it incredible?"</p>

    <p>"No... Daoist Master You misunderstood..."</p>

    <p>"You are being so polite." You Yueqing smiled, splaying her legs, very relaxed and contented: "Actually, I already have someone I like."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong lowered her head: "It must be classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"No." You Yueqing shook her head like a rattle.</p>

    <p>"Eh eh eh?"</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong and Liu Qingyi were surprised.</p>

    <p>"Those birthday gifts I showed off before were indeed sent by Wang Ling. But they were just purely to tease me."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was very happy. She directly showed off her cards: "Oh, I did like Ling Ling for a while when I was a child. But then I became a Taoist priest and I only discovered that kind of feeling as I grew up."</p>

    <p>"It should just be a brother-sister relationship. I think it's more appropriate for him to be my brother."</p>

    <p>"Then the person Taoist Master You likes is..." Liu Qingyi suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>Perhaps realizing that she was being too gossipy, she quickly waved her hand and said, "It's okay, Master You. It doesn't matter even if you don't tell me. I'm just purely curious."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing blinked her eyes. Her sparkling eyes were really beautiful: "When the time comes, I will tell you naturally. But Ling Ling is indeed not bad. If I am rejected in the end, maybe I can let Ling Ling be the spare tire?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Liu Qingyi: "Spare... spare tire..."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing arched her eyebrows and smiled again: "You guys can't help but tease me! Oh, it's not fun!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This fairly sincere exchange really relieved the tension in Sun Rong's heart a lot.</p>

    <p>She had a vague feeling that You Yueqing's identity was not as simple as it seemed.</p>

    <p>At least in the eyes of Sun Rong now. You Yueqing is really mysterious...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Peng family's headquarters is located on the Penglai star in the Central Galaxy. This is a dangerous place in the Central Galaxy. It is surrounded by many celestial bodies containing powerful cosmic energy. From time to time, the eternal cultivators passing by are involved.</p>

    <p>The Peng family set up their headquarters here. It can be said to be like a fortress. It is easy to defend but difficult to attack. No one can attack it. To the outside world, this Penglai star belongs to everyone. But almost all the industries on Penglai star are related to the Peng family. This is an empire that belongs exclusively to the Peng family.</p>

    <p>The Peng family's headquarters on Penglai Planet is a whole golden villa. The buildings are decorated with carved beams and painted buildings, with dragons and phoenixes dancing in the air. You can even see many carved statues of creatures that do not belong to the eternal world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Those were some of the statues of old creatures from the old world. They were grandly carved on the walls as murals by the Peng family. It can be seen that the arrogance of the Peng family has reached a level that is shocking to the world.</p>

    <p>Penglai Star enters the star junction. As the Sun Rong people's carriages pass by in formation, a group of ancient city guards with pedal disc magic tools quickly surround them.</p>

    <p>These neutral guards, who were originally integrated by the four emperors of the four regions to maintain the stability of the central galaxy, have now become targets of instigation from the Peng family.</p>

    <p>This made Emperor Dongda very dissatisfied. He held his breath and looked at the Penglai Star ancient city guards and asked them in a very arrogant manner: "Who are you? What do you do? Do you know where Penglai Star is?"</p>

    <p>"I remember that the Central Galaxy is not under the jurisdiction of any force." Emperor Dongda said calmly. He stared at the ancient city guard in front of him. His face was not afraid: "Today, I brought our young master to Penglai Planet to propose marriage."</p>

    <p>"Proposing a marriage?" An ancient city guard smiled. He was extremely curious: "These are all members of the Peng family. Who can you ask for a marriage proposal?"</p>

    <p>"I remember that this is not a question that you, a guard, should ask." Emperor Dongda tried to control his temper.</p>

    <p>"If you don't explain the reason, we won't let you go." The guard crossed his arms and laughed wildly.</p>

    <p>But soon, his smile stopped abruptly in the next second...</p>
