  <h1>Chapter 2010 Chen Chao and Guo Hao successfully became apprentices!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>However, it is obvious that Cang Long and Liu Yong were basically overthinking. After all, for today's apprenticeship scene, Zhuo Yi set up the situation in advance. Relying on the power of big data, they pushed it for a long time.</p>

    <p>The high school students who were originally in the high school cultivation academy spent their daily life going back and forth between home and school. Faced with these legendary heroes who blocked the invasion of the demon world, Chen Chao and Guo Hao still felt in their hearts Possessing infinite admiration.</p>

    <p>Although there is already a Zhuo Yi at Number 60 High School. But Zhuo Yi actually goes to Number 60 High School every two days. He is so approachable that all the freshness is lost.</p>

    <p>Now I actually met two city heroes having a picnic in the forest. How could the two of them calm down so easily at this moment?</p>

    <p>For a moment, both Chen Chao and Guo Hao temporarily forgot that this was the mysterious forbidden forest inside the Office of Strategic Deception. It stands to reason that although Cang Long and Liu Yong are city heroes, in the final analysis, it is impossible for outsiders to enter here.</p>

    <p>Of course. Zhuo Yi has also prepared this in advance.</p>

    <p>If Chen Chao and Guo Hao don't ask, then Cang Long and Liu Yong don't need to say anything. If they do, they only need to show the invitation issued by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It is said that he came to the mysterious forbidden forest of the Office of Strategic Deception as an inspector to conduct an overall assessment.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect to see two masters here!" Chen Chao and Guo Hao both bowed. Judging from their respectful attitudes, Zhuo Yi thought that the apprenticeship plan was progressing smoothly.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. You two came just in time. There is no need to be cautious. Liu Yong and I were making a bet just now." Seeing the two of them like this, Master Liu Yong felt slightly relieved. Then he started to quickly Entered the state.</p>

    <p>"What are the two masters betting on?"</p>

    <p>"Both of us have no disciples. So we are thinking that if there is a fight between our two disciples, which disciple is more powerful."</p>

    <p>"Oh, so that's it!" Chen Chao and Guo Hao nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>Although the two of them have never seen these legendary masters on weekdays, they have heard of many battles between these powerful men.</p>

    <p>Take the current world of cultivation as an example. In peaceful times, if the competition between powerful people is equal in strength, not only will the battle be fruitless, but it will also cause environmental pollution and space destruction due to various spell bombardments.</p>

    <p>So a long time ago, these masters formed an unwritten agreement, that is, to train their own disciples to let the disciples compete.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao looked at each other at this moment. Their eyes were blazing. They felt like they had seized the opportunity!</p>

    <p>Neither master has any disciples...</p>

    <p>Is this a hint to them?</p>

    <p>Then the two of them are just right...</p>

    <p>Eh. That's not right. It's not necessarily their turn! In addition to the mascot Wang Ling, there are also Sun Rong, Jiugong, Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi and the others...</p>

    <p>In terms of talent and strength. Guo Hao and Chen Chao don't have much confidence to compare with these people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he is still the mascot forever.</p>

    <p>But now the opportunity is right in front of him. At the critical moment, Chen Chao's inner social arrogance started again. He took a step forward, hooked Guo Hao's shoulders, patted his chest and said, "Then Master! You Look. How are we doing!"</p>

    <p>Taken the bait!</p>

    <p>Cang Long and Liu Yong saw that the plan went so smoothly. They looked at each other out of the corner of their eyes and almost laughed.</p>

    <p>This all went much smoother than they imagined.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao. Lord Diulei had already conducted a secret inspection with them. They were indeed disciples tailor-made for them... There is no more suitable candidate than these two!</p>

    <p>The two of them were old friends. They still remained calm. There was some hesitation on their faces at first. Then Cang Long took a hesitant step forward and tapped Chen Chao's forehead with his finger. Liu Yong followed Cang Long. The finger pointed on Guo Hao's forehead.</p>

    <p>"Well... you two have very similar talents."</p>

    <p>Cang Long stroked his white beard. What should he do? "Let's do this. We happen to have a bet, so I'll accept you two as temporary disciples. From today on, we will train you separately. Wait until the agreed time. You Let's have another fight. Then we'll see who's temporary disciple is more powerful."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling on the side finally understood the tricks of these two hero masters.</p>

    <p>The disciple competition is actually just an excuse.</p>

    <p>As long as the two never agree on a time for the competition, then Chen Chao and Guo Hao will be their disciples forever.</p>

    <p>Upon hearing the news, Chen Chao and Guo Hao's eyes lit up, and their heads went blank with excitement.</p>

    <p>Having a city hero-level boss as their master... this is something they would never have imagined!</p>

    <p>"What? Two city heroes are the masters of two juniors. Juniors, you are not willing?" At this time, seeing the scene where the two people were so excited that their minds went blank. Zhuo Yi smiled slightly and quickly added on the side. fire.</p>

    <p>"Yes! How could you not want to!" Chen Chao shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>"Then why don't you kneel down and kowtow to Master? Even if you are a temporary disciple, as a student from our Number 60 High School, you must understand this etiquette. Of course, I can't blame you entirely. It's always you who are too excited to forget. "Zhuo Yi said with a gentle smile.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! Zhuo Yi Senior is right! Hurry up, Guo. Let's go together!" This reminder immediately made Chen Chao suddenly realize.</p>

    <p>Immediately, the two of them knelt down and kowtowed to Cang Long and Liu Yong respectively, speaking in unison.</p>

    <p>"Master, please bow to my disciple Chen Chao!"</p>

    <p>"Master, please bow to me, my disciple Guo Hao!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Very good! Get up quickly, disciples!" As masters, Cang Long and Liu Yong should be very graceful. After the two of them performed the apprenticeship ceremony, they stepped forward to help their precious disciples up.</p>

    <p>This scene. Wang Ling also saw it.</p>

    <p>This master-disciple pairing appears to be arranged by the planner Zhuo Yi. But in fact, the mastermind behind the scenes is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>A disciple who is willing to make every effort to practice. And a master who treats his disciples as treasures. From Wang Ling's point of view, there is no better match.</p>

    <p>Although Cang Long and Liu Yong have different cultivation directions, they both have one biggest characteristic, that is, they are very protective of their shortcomings. With them by their side, Chen Chao and Guo Hao's future cultivation paths will be bright.</p>

    <p>"Master! Can you accept my brother as well?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao and Guo Hao looked aside at Wang Ling almost at the same time.</p>

    <p>This scene was beyond Wang Ling's expectations. It was also beyond Cang Long and Liu Yong's expectations.</p>

    <p>After all, this was something that was not planned in the script.</p>

    <p>No one expected that even when Chen Chao and Guo Hao successfully became their masters under the city hero, they could still think of Wang Ling in the first place...</p>

    <p>Cang Long and Liu Yong laughed loudly. They each touched the heads of Chen Chao and Guo Hao. They felt more and more that their decision to accept Chen Chao and Guo Hao as their disciples was correct.</p>

    <p>The character of the disciple is equally important.</p>

    <p>After becoming apprentices, the two of them were not dazzled by joy. They could still think of their classmates. This was very rare in the eyes of Cang Long and Liu Yong.</p>

    <p>"It seems. This is your best friend."</p>

    <p>Cang Long spoke first. He looked at Wang Ling carefully. Then he comforted Chen Chao and Guo Hao: "When choosing a disciple, you still have to look at the compatibility. If the compatibility is not good, no matter how strong the master is, the professor's disciples will not be the same. There will be progress. But Master Liu Yong and I are not the most suitable masters for your friends."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Is that so..."</p>

    <p>This is a disguised rejection.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao couldn't help feeling a little disappointed when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm always very accurate in judging people. This good friend of yours will find his own place in the future." Cang Long laughed.</p>

    <p>As one of the few friends I made at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Ling was listening to Cang Long's rough but extremely sweet laughter. He couldn't help but feel a little moved in his heart.</p>
