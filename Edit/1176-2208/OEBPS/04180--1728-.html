  <h1>Chapter 1728 Brothers join forces</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With Sun Rong sneaking in to help, Wang Ming and Shou Chong's manufacturing progress is undoubtedly much faster. Aohai's sword energy is powerful. Every component can be accurately cut according to the drawings constructed in Wang Ming's mind. Even just one piece. Screws the size of melon seeds are no problem either.</p>

    <p>This scene is just like the last time Wang Ming had a battle of wits and courage with the Ghost Tou Dao. I'm afraid Master Wu Xin would never have dreamed that when he controlled Wang Ming's body, in this spiritual space, this exiled ghost ship On the ship...someone is actually building a giant mecha and trying to fight against him.</p>

    <p>This kind of behavior of "Ultraman fighting monsters" on the sea. The movie {Pacific Rim} speaks directly to the experts.</p>

    <p>When all the parts were completed one by one, Wang Ming breathed a sigh of relief, because there was only the last step left. As long as he gave an instruction, all the assembled parts on the ship could be assembled immediately and turned into a complete giant mecha.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect it. It really worked!" Shou Chong was extremely excited. As a lone wolf among scientists, he has always relied on the power of words to research products. The assistants in the laboratory were hired as odd jobs. Almost all of them were hired for odd jobs. He does all the core aspects personally.</p>

    <p>And now, this sense of joy and excitement after working with others has somehow become particularly intense at this moment.</p>

    <p>"There are two positions: the main driver's seat and the passenger's seat. I'll take the driver's seat. Don't get excited. It's still the last step." Wang Ming looked serious. Then the two people put on the separate cores of the main driver and the passenger seat respectively. There was a burst of Electromagnetic waves. The bodies of the two people actually floated into the air on this ghost ship. They did not stop until they were nearly eighty meters in the air.</p>

    <p>Ghost ship, on the sea. At this moment, all the assembled giant mecha parts were inspired by the core. They moved together. A huge Wang Ling mecha was successfully assembled on this abandoned sea. It burst out with powerful energy.</p>

    <p>The giant Wang Ling mecha. It is stronger than Wang Ming imagined. Because Sun Rong helped during the assembly process. Aohai's sword seal is added to almost every part.</p>

    <p>This sword seal is similar to an enchantment effect. It can greatly increase the overall combat power of the mecha on the original basis!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was sitting in the main driver's seat. Feeling the power of this giant Wang Ling mecha, he couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>On this giant Wang Ling mecha!</p>

    <p>But there is the sword seal of the nine-core spiritual sword!</p>

    <p>He has never fought such a rich battle in his eight lives!</p>

    <p>"Too strong...we can really regain sovereignty!" Shou Chong stretched out his trembling hands and held them on the joystick in the passenger seat. His face was full of excitement.</p>

    <p>At this time, he and Wang Ming were both in the body of this giant Wang Ling mecha. They felt the powerful spiritual energy emitted by the mecha. They were both full of confidence in the next battle.</p>

    <p>"Thanks to Rongrong for planting strawberries on this giant Wang Ling." Wang Ming said. He really didn't expect things to go as smoothly as this.</p>

    <p>"That's a sword seal... not some kind of strawberry..." Sun Rong quickly retorted.</p>

    <p>"It's the same. I won't plant it today. I will plant it in the future." Wang Ming smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling;"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>The brief teasing was over. After testing the sensitivity of the giant Wang Ling mecha, Wang Ming finally decided to challenge the giant aircraft carrier that was taken away by Master Wu Xin in this sea area!</p>

    <p>"Brother Shou Chong. It's time for us to perform."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised the corners of his lips. After counting down three times, he and Shou Chong pushed the joystick in front of him at the same time.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>At that moment, the sword seals on this giant mecha were intertwined. The nine-core sword seals were superimposed from all parts of the mecha's body at this moment, making it exude an amazing aura! The gray-black body actually showed a A glazed color dominated by blue. Like a sea dragon soaring into the sky.</p>

    <p>Then! A whoosh!</p>

    <p>The eighty-meter-tall giant mecha was not cumbersome at all. It turned into a stream of light and moved across the sea. Where it passed, the waves divided it into two water walls on the left and right.</p>

    <p>It actually showed a scene of the sea splitting. Wang Ming's speed was really too fast. The stream of light transformed by the giant mecha quickly approached the main body of the aircraft carrier where Master Wu Xin was located. Master Wu Xin was unable to react in a short time.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until it was about to hit that Master Wu Xin received a warning sound internally.</p>

    <p>He reacted extremely quickly. Although his brain had not fully recovered, Wang Ming's operation was also within his expectations.</p>

    <p>However, he was extremely confident. He would not dodge at all and planned to face him head-on.</p>

    <p>Although the giant aircraft carrier he stretched out now was built by Wang Ming, the person at the helm of the aircraft carrier is now himself. And after merging with God, the combat strength of the giant aircraft carrier is no longer at the same level as before.</p>

    <p>As an earthling who is not a cultivator, Wang Ming can develop his brain to this extent. To be honest, it is beyond Master Wu Xin's expectation. But with such a level of brain, he still won't let it go. In the eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ha. Do you want to regain your position? You're talking nonsense... Now that you've fallen, don't dance anymore." He snorted. The aircraft carrier radar quickly tracked Wang Ming's giant mecha.</p>

    <p>However, the speed of movement surprised him.</p>

    <p>If he guessed correctly, Wang Ming should have used the scraps in the abandoned sea to assemble such a thing in a short time. But those things are all scraps! They are scrap materials! How can the performance of this piece of assembly be so superior?</p>

    <p>"court death!"</p>

    <p>He held the rudder tightly with one hand and pressed the red button in front of him with the other hand.</p>

    <p>In an instant, tens of thousands of turrets were activated on the giant aircraft carrier. Countless missiles were fired at Wang Ming's giant mecha at this moment.</p>

    <p>These missiles were like raindrops. They shot quickly from the sky. The gunfire and smoke screen were connected together. Runes were lingering on each missile. The psychic energy was huge.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was surprised. He didn't expect Master Wu Xin to be able to increase the overall combat power to this level after taking over his giant aircraft carrier.</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong hadn't helped them this time, even if they had built this mecha, their chances of winning would have been unknown.</p>

    <p>Facing these flying missiles, Wang Ming's goal is also very clear.</p>

    <p>He came to destroy this giant aircraft carrier. So he went straight to the back door of the giant aircraft carrier!</p>

    <p>This is the backhand he left behind when he built the aircraft carrier. If he hits it with one hit, this giant aircraft carrier will directly disintegrate!</p>

    <p>Therefore, he had no intention of avoiding these missiles. Instead, he charged forward directly against the thousands of bullets and launched an impact. Master Wu Xin was stunned by such a desperate posture.</p>

    <p>At the same time, what shocked Master Wu Xin even more was that after Wang Ming controlled this giant mecha to keep approaching, he finally saw clearly what this giant mecha looked like!</p>

    <p>When the iconic dead fish eyes of Wang Ling appeared vividly on the giant mecha and looked into Master Wu Xin's eyes, a fear originating from the depths of his heart was instantly outlined.</p>

    <p>These dead fish eyes. Although they look harmless to humans and animals, they are extremely lethal...</p>

    <p>Why is it you again!</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin was so frightened that his mind immediately went blank.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the sword spirit space of Sun Rong, Wang Ling opened his eyes at the same time. He waved his hand gently.</p>

    <p>In the void, the tens of thousands of missile warheads launched at Wang Ming turned around at the same time and followed Wang Ming towards the giant aircraft carrier.</p>
