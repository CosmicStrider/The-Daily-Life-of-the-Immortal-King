  <h1>Chapter 2073 Legendary Loose Cultivator Hong 4 Wonders</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On Yama Island, the casual cultivators who originally said they were just here to join in the fun, when they saw the Sword Master approaching, turned into streams of light and shot forward.</p>

    <p>However, these are just a mob after all. The key figure is still there, the casual cultivator Venerated Immortal who has been hiding from the beginning. He is hiding on the island.</p>

    <p>The first Venerated Immortal on Earth is Zhenyuan. Now Zhenyuan has made friends with Wang Ling. His realm has already surpassed that of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>However, for the vast majority of monks on the earth currently, the realm of Venerated Immortal after the ninth level of True Immortal is the new god of the earth.</p>

    <p>The gap in realm is often insurmountable. The gap between True Immortal and Venerated Immortal is naturally extremely obvious.</p>

    <p>No matter how powerful True Immortal is, it is only limited to the Earth.</p>

    <p>And to reach Venerated Immortal. As long as you have enough resource reserves, you can start a short interstellar journey in the universe.</p>

    <p>This alone is enough to judge the huge abyss-like level gap between the two.</p>

    <p>A casual cultivator can directly enter the Venerated Immortal realm after completing the upgrade on the earth. This is enough to prove that the opponent must have been in the realm of the ninth level of True Immortal before the upgrade. And he must have accumulated the air and sea spiritual power for a long time. Otherwise, it is impossible to be in the realm after the upgrade. Complete the level of Venerated Immortal in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>You can count the number of Venerated Immortals on the earth now with open hands. The lost Maiko Assi from Glio City is said to be the first person to be promoted to Venerated Immortal after the upgrade.</p>

    <p>What makes people feel even more ironic now is that it is outrageous that this first person would actually lose himself in the restricted area of the sea.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui crossed his arms. So far, he had been just watching the excitement. He would only take action when necessary.</p>

    <p>He also wanted to see if this legendary sword master had anything hidden.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>All the cultivators took action. The lowest realm among them was the peak of the ninth level of Nascent Soul. The light effects of various magic weapons in the raised hands were intertwined into one piece. The spiritual energy spread directly in the void, covering the air in brilliance.</p>

    <p>A seemingly fierce melee was about to break out.</p>

    <p>But Yi Jianchuan's expression did not change at all. The purpose of his trip to the restricted sea area was to test who was the mysterious Party A who had been monitoring him behind the scenes and now launched a siege against him and his newly acquired disciple Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>On this basis, we must also help Wang Muyu search for useful clues in the restricted sea area to find his biological parents.</p>

    <p>The prerequisite for finding his biological parents is that he can only win this battle! He cannot lose!</p>

    <p>I saw him gently raising his hand. A ball of sea water was condensing on his fingertips following the sword intention.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the seawater mass split apart in his hands. Drops of water mixed with the sword intent of the Wuji Sword separated from it. Then, in the process of striking back at high speed in all directions, they turned into small swords that were almost difficult to see clearly with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Small swords condensed from sea water droplets are as thin as gossamer. They are directly aimed at all the besieging people in the field and swept out.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The casual cultivators who attacked from the sky fell like locusts one after another. Their thighs were pierced. Their skin and flesh were torn open, and blood flowed freely.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu could see that Yi Jianchuan actually did not want the lives of these people.</p>

    <p>And this happens to be the most cunning part of this besieger.</p>

    <p>Choose to do it in front of the entrance to the sea in the restricted area.</p>

    <p>If they really enter the sea restricted area, it will be a matter of life and death. Even if they are killed directly, there will be no problem.</p>

    <p>But Yama Island. Although this is an open public island that does not belong to any cultivation country, it is still within the constraints of {International Cultivation Law}.</p>

    <p>If there were a large number of casual cultivators who died here, it would probably be detrimental to Huaxiu Country in terms of public opinion in the international cultivation world. Those remote cultivation countries like to add fuel to the fire on some issues, confuse right and wrong, and even directly make up stories and add all kinds of magical magic. The underworld filter maliciously edits some originally normal scenes into horror films.</p>

    <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!...</p>

    <p>The Wuji Sword's sword intent and water droplets of sword intent swept in all directions one after another. This move almost completely cleared out the casual cultivators in an instant.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan did not kill anyone.</p>

    <p>But those who were injured no longer dare to take action. True Immortal is the ninth level peak state. Before the earth upgrades, it is the strongest state on earth that no one dares to challenge easily.</p>

    <p>But now after the upgrade, things have changed in the eyes of some people.</p>

    <p>Not far away, a young man who had been sitting cross-legged in the darkness of the island for a long time opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>Before, he had always kept his aura to hide himself very well. He thought he was perfectly hidden. But Zhang Zhui and Wang Muyu had smelled this smell from a long way away.</p>

    <p>Before meeting Yue Lingwei, Zhang Zhui had already determined that in addition to Yue Lingwei, who was suspected of being the Eternal One, there was another Venerated Immortal master.</p>

    <p>But at this time, he still pretended not to know. He looked at Yue Lingwei with the face of a curious baby: "Hey? Why don't you join? It turns out that you are not the one who set up the plan to assassinate the sword master and his disciples?"</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei rolled his eyes secretly. The corner of his mouth under the mask twitched violently. He felt that Zhang Zhui's deliberate probing was too low.</p>

    <p>As long as people are not stupid, they can almost guess that this is a lie.</p>

    <p>Perhaps to avoid misunderstanding, Yue Lingwei took a deep breath and said coldly: "I never wanted to do it. But if you want to know who did it, I can tell you."</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>"Legendary Loose Cultivator. Hong Siqi."</p>

    <p>"Never heard of it." Zhang Zhui shook his head.</p>

    <p>"You must be a casual cultivator too. You haven't even heard of Hong Siqi's name." Yue Lingwei has not yet spoken. The two cultivators next to him who were directly called "dying people" by Zhang Zhui are almost Said in unison.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Zhang Zhui discovered something interesting: "Eh? You two are twins?"</p>

    <p>"So what?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Ouyang Miaokun."</p>

    <p>"My name is Ouyang Fenkun."</p>

    <p>The two of them introduced each other.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I've never heard your names."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhuo clasped his hands and clasped his fists. He thought these brothers were quite interesting.</p>

    <p>He had previously called the two of them dying people. It was indeed a bit impolite. But the two of them held back and did not fall out. They even answered his questions as usual.</p>

    <p>With this little bit of charisma, Zhang Zhui thinks that the probability of these two successfully breaking through the limit and reaching Venerated Immortal status can be at least 2% higher.</p>

    <p>"There are so many casual cultivators in this world. Everyone's way of life is different. They are not from the casual cultivator circle. I don't know that my two brothers are normal. But you should know the name Hong Siqi."</p>

    <p>I heard Ouyang Miokun, the slightly thinner one of the two, say: "Zhuo Yi. You always know, right?"</p>

    <p>"City hero. Today's legend. Defeat the demon king. Of course I know this." Zhang Zhui laughed.</p>

    <p>"You only know one but not the other."</p>

    <p>Ouyang Miaokun said: "There have been rumors in the casual cultivator community. It is said that Zhuo Yi has accomplished so many feats. It is all because there is a master behind it."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Is there another way to say this?" At this moment, Zhang Zhui's eyes really lit up. He felt as if he could eat a big melon.</p>

    <p>"Can't you think of it? There are even more things you can't think of!"</p>

    <p>Ouyang Miaokun laughed and said, "Actually, this Hong Siqi is the master of Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "???"</p>
