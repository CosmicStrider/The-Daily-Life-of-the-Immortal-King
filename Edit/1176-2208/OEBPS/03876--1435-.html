  <h1>Chapter 1435 Hairdresser</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Peng Xiren rubbed his eyes. At first he thought he had seen it wrong.</p>

    <p>"impossible..."</p>

    <p>What was hidden in that tear mole made his hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>It can't be wrong.</p>

    <p>Although. This is just a faint outline...</p>

    <p>He could not clearly see the true form of the Dharma in the mole of tears. He could only catch a glimpse of its outline, and his eyes were already bloodshot.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, there was a "puff" sound. Peng Xiren's eyes were like exploding peeing cow balls. Two streams of blood spurted out. Then they quickly repaired under the surrounding starlight.</p>

    <p>The monk was amazed at Peng Xiren's methods.</p>

    <p>It is indeed a bit scary to be able to repair it even if it is backfired by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In order to trace the origin of Wang Ling, a swastika was scrapped.</p>

    <p>And now, the monk guessed that what Peng Xiren saw should be what he saw at the beginning. The faint humanoid outline born in chaos...</p>

    <p>The monk just had a guess in his mind, but he was not sure what it was.</p>

    <p>But looking at Peng Xiren's pale face now, he seems to have recognized the origin of this human-shaped outline.</p>

    <p>"Why...why is there such a thing on you..." Peng Xiren was frightened. His whole body was covered with chills. He was sure that he was not mistaken.</p>

    <p>Through the black mole in the corner of Wang Ling's eye, Peng Xiren seemed to feel that there was another universe hidden in that black mole!</p>

    <p>This black mole is like a black hole. It attracts his eyes and gradually guides his spirit, completing a super-speed "interstellar travel." And it is at the center of the universe where this black mole is transformed.</p>

    <p>What Peng Xiren saw. It was the outline of a human figure born from chaos...</p>

    <p>The spirit of the universe!</p>

    <p>This is what he saw!</p>

    <p>One person. Can actually turn the spirit of the universe into a dharma form?</p>

    <p>But it seems that the spirit of the universe has not yet fully awakened.</p>

    <p>If we wait for the spirit of the universe to truly revive, then the young man in front of us may become even more powerful than he is now.</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren's Adam's apple rolled.</p>

    <p>He always thought that Wang Ling was just an ancestral master hiding on the earth like a monk.</p>

    <p>But in the end, Peng Xiren realized that he had underestimated the young man in front of him.</p>

    <p>If you want to kill, you can only do it now, before the opponent is fully formed...</p>

    <p>If it waits until it develops, it will be completely unbeatable.</p>

    <p>In his hand, Peng Xiren's "Galaxy·Cannon·Fist·Cannon!" was still charging. He looked at Wang Ling: "You have the ability. Just wait for me to charge for a while..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shrugged indifferently: "..."</p>

    <p>He could actually feel it. Now Peng Xiren regrets it.</p>

    <p>I regretted why I was so arrogant in the first place. I insisted on asking him to sacrifice the Dharma.</p>

    <p>If there was no Dharma image, Peng Xiren might have punched right now.</p>

    <p>However, after seeing the Dharma of Wang Ling, Peng Xiren suddenly felt that his little power might not be enough... so he applied for an extension of power storage again.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he really wanted to beat himself to death with a big-eared melon seed.</p>

    <p>Why do you still have to talk so fast in the middle of a war...</p>

    <p>But the problem is that even Peng Xiren himself would not have thought that the boy in front of him would be the spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>Isn't that something that his master has been pursuing and then gave up...</p>

    <p>"Are you ready?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling stared at Peng Xiren. A plain voice entered Peng Xiren's mind.</p>

    <p>"No... wait any longer!" Peng Xiren frowned. His face turned red as he gathered strength.</p>

    <p>This state. Wang Ling seems familiar.</p>

    <p>It's like the feeling when Father Wang squats on the toilet because of constipation. Because you also need to accumulate strength when you are constipated.</p>

    <p>In addition to accumulating power, you also need to learn accurate calculations.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren needs to calculate how much power he needs to accumulate before he can defeat himself.</p>

    <p>And Father Wang needs to calculate what shape to pull out when the power is accumulated, so that the water from the poop falling into the toilet will not splash on his butt.</p>

    <p>Two completely different behaviors. At this moment, there is a striking similarity in Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, life is full of knowledge!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He counted the time with his fingers. Then he looked at Peng Xiren. Warm reminder: "Are you ready?"</p>

    <p>"Are you bothered? We can't wait any longer!" Peng Xiren was annoyed by the question and got angry on the spot.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled coldly: "You have such a bad attitude. I think Ling Zhenren, you shouldn't wait any longer. Just take action."</p>

    <p>"Bald Donkey! This is a battle between me and him. Don't get in the way!"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren suddenly panicked when he heard what the monk said. He was afraid that Wang Ling would take action before he could finish the attack. He almost yelled out immediately.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling remained silent. Said nothing.</p>

    <p>He knew. Peng Xiren was anxious.</p>

    <p>However, he is willing to keep waiting.</p>

    <p>Death. Let Peng Xiren die clearly.</p>

    <p>About a quarter of an hour passed. When Wang Ling memorized pi to more than 10,000 digits.</p>

    <p>Over there. Peng Xiren finally heard the news: "I'm coming Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>"Has it finally begun..." Wang Ling sighed in his heart. He had never felt that fighting with someone could be so painful.</p>

    <p>This punch. He had waited long enough.</p>

    <p>He hoped that Peng Xiren could really hurt himself. Even if it was just a little bit of skin.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling has never had any injuries since he was young. When he wrestled, there would be earthquakes all around him. Even the spirit of the earth would tremble.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. You actually let me accumulate energy for so long...I tell you, this will be the most regrettable decision you will ever make in your life!" At this time, Peng Xiren bit hard. Grit your teeth.</p>

    <p>"Die!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, he punched out. This "Galaxy·Cannon·Punch·Cannon!" that had been charged for nearly half an hour was finally punched out of his hand!</p>

    <p>A light wave with a radius as large as the sun blasted straight towards the direction of Wang Ling. Everything in its path was being destroyed. Those planets that were in the way were directly penetrated. Along with the various major planets, The screams of spirits and the roar of star core explosions!</p>

    <p>The light of the cannon version of Galaxy Fist immediately flew to Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Finally, this shot accurately hit Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>A huge explosion occurred at the location where Wang Ling was located. The fluctuations caused by the terrifying light wave impact of the Galaxy Fist shook the world. The generated air waves moved the surrounding planets several light-years away.</p>

    <p>This scene was like a billiard cue accurately hitting the billiard ball, resulting in a series of chain reactions. The monk was amazed to see it.</p>

    <p>"Successful!" Peng Xiren was pleasantly surprised.</p>

    <p>However, he was happy for less than three seconds. Under the destructive light of an explosion in front of him, the unscathed figure of the young man gradually emerged in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>"No...it can't be..."</p>

    <p>Beads of sweat covered Peng Xiren's face almost instantly.</p>

    <p>He had been accumulating a punch for half an hour...</p>

    <p>As a result, the boy in front of me was actually unscathed!</p>

    <p>"Not bad." Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. He rubbed his hair with his index finger.</p>

    <p>Under Peng Xiren's cannon version of Galaxy Fist.</p>

    <p>His hair became curly.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren... gave him a perm...</p>

    <p>In all these years. Wang Ling has never had her hair permed.</p>

    <p>Because his hair is so hard that it can't be permed at all.</p>

    <p>And now, he is even more reluctant to kill Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that Peng Xiren has the potential to be Tony's teacher.</p>
