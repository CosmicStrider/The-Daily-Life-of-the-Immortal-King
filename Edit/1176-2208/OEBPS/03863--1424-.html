  <h1>Chapter 1424 Enemies from outside the galaxy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Very satisfied with Leng Ming's performance in the first battle. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although this kind of learning ability cannot catch up with him, but overall it has reached the passing line.</p>

    <p>If calculated according to the 100-point system, the normal passing mark is 60 points.</p>

    <p>However, in Wang Ling's mind, 95 points is a passing grade.</p>

    <p>A score of 96--98 is average.</p>

    <p>99--100 is excellent.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's learning ability. Wang Ling is initially judged to be 95 points.</p>

    <p>This is enough.</p>

    <p>Because Leng Ming is still young, there is still room for growth.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying turned into a black shadow and seeped in through the crack of the door.</p>

    <p>Then, with sight visible, the black shadow gradually turned into a human form, condensing Wang Ying's proud face.</p>

    <p>He whistled and showed a satisfied expression.</p>

    <p>It would be even more perfect if I had another cigarette at this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart. Shadow is really a magical thing... it is obviously a power bred from his body. But this personality is very different from his own.</p>

    <p>Just now Wang Ling saw Wang Ying gagging Sun Ying'er's mouth at the doorway, and his mind suddenly went blank.</p>

    <p>The first reaction that comes to mind is: Isn't Wang Ying afraid of sucking out Sun Ying'er's tongue?</p>

    <p>But no matter what, the scene in front of me is still beyond Wang Ling's own understanding.</p>

    <p>Shadow actually has no actual age...</p>

    <p>Theoretically, they don't count as humans.</p>

    <p>But my own shadow and Sun Rong's shadow can be together first.</p>

    <p>This is something Wang Ling didn't expect.</p>

    <p>"Lord, rest assured. I have planted seeds in him." At this time, Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling knows what this "seed" refers to.</p>

    <p>When these words came out of Wang Ying's mouth, it felt like something had changed...</p>

    <p>This is a defensive seed. It can be triggered in times of crisis.</p>

    <p>It was also ordered by Wang Ling to arrange it for Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, you only need to engrave the seal of defense against seeds on your palm, and then tap it lightly like tapping a stamp.</p>

    <p>God knows Wang Ying chose to gag her directly.</p>

    <p>This method can also be called ingenious...</p>

    <p>"The Sword Master is here. What are you worried about?" To be honest, Jingke himself was also surprised that Wang Ling personally took charge of the Sword King Realm this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was present in person. Naturally, there was Wang Ling's reason.</p>

    <p>There will be changes in this Sword Conference. This is something that Wang Ling planned to do yesterday.</p>

    <p>"There is an enemy attack."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying answered Jingke's question: "And. The other party's origin is outside the region and beyond the galaxy."</p>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy?</p>

    <p>Jingke instantly thought of this mysterious universe.</p>

    <p>The vastness of the infinite galaxy is far beyond the reach of the outer galaxies.</p>

    <p>Back then, the immortals of Zhenyuan roamed the outer galaxy for a thousand years in search of the Drought Star, but never completed the journey.</p>

    <p>If we go to the Infinite Galaxy, even if we go to the realm of Venerated Immortal for a billion years, we may not be able to complete it.</p>

    <p>"What's the purpose?" Jingke asked again.</p>

    <p>Enemies from the Infinite Galaxy. For the first time in history.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of the lack of understanding of the enemy that Wang Ling feels uneasy.</p>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy. If it weren't for the power of deduction that made him know this new term. Wang Ling really didn't know that there was a layer beyond the extraterrestrial galaxy.</p>

    <p>Is it really a nesting doll of the universe?</p>

    <p>He didn't know much about the Infinite Galaxy. He didn't know what the level of the enemies coming from there was.</p>

    <p>What if they're better than me?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling knows he is strong.</p>

    <p>But I have always understood the truth that there are mountains beyond the mountains.</p>

    <p>Because of this, he has always been very humble.</p>

    <p>"It's possible to turn the six Heavenly Dao into gems. Then embed them into gloves and snap your fingers. The universe will be destroyed!" Wang Ying said with a look of horror on his face.</p>

    <p>"This..." Jingke looked horrified. He almost took it seriously.</p>

    <p>Just as I was about to ask a question, I saw Wang Ying continue to say: "There is a high probability that I am here for Leng Ming."</p>

    <p>"Leng Ming." Jingke nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>This answer is more reasonable.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming is transformed from the Tomb Grass.</p>

    <p>And where is the celestial tomb?</p>

    <p>Rumor has it that it was a cosmic tomb that Dao Ancestor Wang built for himself.</p>

    <p>And buried in this tomb are the treasures that Dao Ancestor Wang has accumulated throughout his life.</p>

    <p>The person is obviously not dead, but he wants to build a tomb for himself first. This is the standard boss mentality...</p>

    <p>It is said that Dao Ancestor Wang built the Heavenly Tomb when he was in middle age.</p>

    <p>He thought his end was coming, so he built this tomb in advance.</p>

    <p>As a result, even Dao Ancestor Wang himself did not expect that he could be "reincarnated."</p>

    <p>This directly led to the "Celestial Tomb" he built. It has not been moved in yet.</p>

    <p>"The location of the Sky Tomb is very vague. The exact location is not yet known. It may be in the extraterrestrial galaxy. It may also be in the infinite galaxy."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said: "Leng Ming was transformed from the Tomb Grass. It was a piece of dead grass stuck under the soles of Dao Ancestor Wang's feet when he came to the Sword King Realm. Unexpectedly, after years of baptism, the dead grass would bloom in spring. And finally Successfully gave birth to Leng Ming in the Sword King Realm..."</p>

    <p>In fact, when it comes to this, Jingke has roughly understood it.</p>

    <p>This enemy from the Infinite Galaxy is looking for Leng Ming. Its ultimate goal is the Sky Tomb.</p>

    <p>In order to obtain the treasure of Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>"So, the Lord himself came here to..."</p>

    <p>"You're right."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying knew what Jingke was thinking. There was a solemn look on his face: "On this point, your leader and I have the same idea. We have never come into contact with enemies from the infinite galaxy. What if this happens? If we underestimate the enemy too much, it may cause unimaginable disaster."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The first battle is Leng Ming's battle. The people from Infinite Galaxy have never made a move. The Lord feels that the opponent is very likely to show up when Miss Sun comes on the stage. That's why I asked me to plant defensive seeds in advance."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"That is to say, this time, the Lord and I will go all out to deal with this enemy from outside the galaxy." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"..." Jingke remained silent for three consecutive days.</p>

    <p>Look at this posture. He felt that he might witness history...</p>

    <p>If you go all out, does that mean that all the seals on Talisman will be revealed?</p>

    <p>Of course. Jingke also felt that.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Thinking too much...</p>

    <p>Although the knowledge of the infinite galaxy is limited.</p>

    <p>But Jingke thinks he has some knowledge of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>No matter what the origin of this enemy of the infinite galaxy is...</p>

    <p>Even if you don't reveal the sealing talisman, the opponent will still die!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But he fell in love with the man at first sight.</p>

    <p>Jingke thinks that his vision is pretty good.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the Tianzihao room of Sun Rong. As Wang Ying expected, Sun Ying'er completely fell into autistic mode.</p>

    <p>"Stop crying Ying'er... Master of Shadows should. It wasn't intentional." Sun Rong tried to comfort.</p>

    <p>"You... you still speak for him..." Sun Ying'er cried even more sadly. She touched her belly. She was trying to get rid of the anger in her stomach: "Just kiss him. What! Why are you blowing into my mouth!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at Sun Ying'er's big belly. She really didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>He actually let the Master of Shadows kiss him...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Rong feels a little sour in his mouth.</p>
