  <h1>Chapter 1446 Looking for Dead Fish Eyes</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is coming in force. This is something Zhuo Yi did not expect.</p>

    <p>Since they want to further expand the Jiugong family's market in Huaxiu, I'm afraid the Jiugong family's current strategy is to operate on their own, the most popular general administration.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is tired. There are already a lot of doubts about him on the Internet. If Jiugong Liangzi releases all the evidence, I am afraid it will cause another disturbance.</p>

    <p>God knows the Jiugong family will use a "Day-traveling ghost" as a witness...</p>

    <p>Because there was really no third outsider in the core area at that time.</p>

    <p>If you insist on saying it, Fang Xing is one of them. But now Fang Xing is not an outsider. And even if the Jiugong family can find Fang Xing, Fang Xing will not tell anyone like that because of his temper.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we need to discuss this matter with Master as soon as possible. By the way, I asked him to be more careful these days." Zhuo Yi vaguely felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He immediately sent a text message to Wang Ling, asking him to be careful about the girl named Jiugong.</p>

    <p>Because in the previous conversation, Jiugong specifically mentioned the iconic feature of "dead fish eyes."</p>

    <p>And she firmly believed that the dead fish-eyed boy who was at the scene was studying at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>"Master, be careful. There is a girl named Jiugong who seems to be looking for dead fish eyes all over the world... She is doubting what happened six years ago."</p>

    <p>After editing the text message to Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi stored Jiugong Liangzi's phone number in his mobile phone based on the relevant information provided by Jiugong's family.</p>

    <p>Name Remarks: To The Queen of A</p>

    <p>Done!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi closed the phone. He sat on Principal Chen's leather sofa and thought for a while.</p>

    <p>This girl Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>It's really hard to deal with.</p>

    <p>However, the other party chose to reveal his identity directly and come to Number 60 High School for internal investigation. This was definitely a wrong choice.</p>

    <p>Anyone who has killed werewolves knows that it is not a wise decision to identify oneself from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School. But it's his territory.</p>

    <p>There is absolutely no possibility of causing trouble here.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Zhuo Yi sent another text message to another person: "Master's wife. The person named Jiugong Liangzi is investigating the master. She came to the school to register today. Please pay attention."</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong replied almost in a second: "Who is your master's wife..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi can feel a puff of steam across the screen.</p>

    <p>Hey hey hey.</p>

    <p>Now there is something good to watch. Even if you don't deal with it yourself.</p>

    <p>With Sun Rong's personality, I'm afraid Jiugong Liangzi won't get any benefits at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>To know.</p>

    <p>The last girl I came to get close to was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It has been clearly arranged by Miss Sun.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling fell into deep thought after receiving the text message.</p>

    <p>He discovered that people nowadays really can't help but praise.</p>

    <p>When he was in front of the teaching building, he was still secretly rejoicing. This new Jiugong Liangzi was not here for him.</p>

    <p>The result was unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p>The other party made a circle.</p>

    <p>In the end, he sprinted 100 meters in his own direction.</p>

    <p>To summarize, the only piece of evidence Jiugong Liangzi has now is probably the "Day-traveling ghost" that has lived for decades.</p>

    <p>But this Day-traveling ghost cannot be used as conclusive evidence.</p>

    <p>After all, everyone knows that the Jiugong family has been responsible for exorcising demons for generations. Who knows if this Day-traveling ghost is just telling nonsense to save his life.</p>

    <p>So the purpose of Jiugong Liangzi entering Number 60 High School is actually to find Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As long as we find the boy that the Day-traveling ghost witnessed, then this will be the key evidence.</p>

    <p>After calculation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling roughly understands Jiugong Liangzi's thoughts.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes and released his spiritual consciousness.</p>

    <p>Directly locking Jiugong Liangzi's position in the school.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that Jiugong Liangzi is just here to register today. He can leave after registration is completed.</p>

    <p>But the other party doesn't seem to be planning to evacuate...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the teaching building, Jiugong Liangzi was walking in the corridor of the school with a proud face. She was like a black swan, exuding an amazing aloof aura.</p>

    <p>The only thing that seemed out of place was the female bodyguard behind him carrying a bag full of pancakes and fruits.</p>

    <p>"Is this the transfer student from Sun Island? So beautiful..."</p>

    <p>"You're dressed in a dark style! You can't be a yandere. You have to be careful when dating such a person. Maybe it will end in a hatchet!"</p>

    <p>"Hey. I find that it would be better for us to be the president. This is too cold and cold. I don't dare to go up and talk to her at all."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>All the surrounding sounds were transmitted to Jiugong Liangzi's ears.</p>

    <p>Her eyes were like rays, scanning back and forth around her. Many people thought Jiugong Liangzi was angry and quickly closed her mouth.</p>

    <p>In fact. This Jiugong Liangzi is secretly looking for dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>He does not get angry easily in front of outsiders. This is a good accomplishment that Jiugong Liangzi developed under the traditional education of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>As a eldest lady, she must act like a eldest lady. She enjoys resources that most people in the world do not have.</p>

    <p>It is normal to have some criticisms.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it has long been common for outsiders to discuss Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Besides, these words are not vicious. They are not even qualified to make her heart beat up and down.</p>

    <p>She deliberately walked very slowly, passing by every classroom, searching for boys with dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>Then write down what they look like.</p>

    <p>Although no one dared to get too close to her during the whole process, the movement was still a bit too loud.</p>

    <p>After searching the first two classrooms, a girl seemed to have mustered up the courage. She walked towards Jiugong Liangzi and reached out her hand: "Hello, classmate Jiugong Liangzi!"</p>

    <p>"Who are you?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glanced at the girl's hand. He didn't know what he was thinking about, but in the end he didn't hold it. He just said: "If you want anything, just say it."</p>

    <p>"I am the secretary of the student union... Our president would like to invite you to come." The short-haired girl smiled. She did not expect Jiugong Liangzi to be so cold and cold. She retracted her hand in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"Does your president often exploit you?" Jiugong Liangzi found it interesting.</p>

    <p>She knows who the student council president of Number 60 High School is.</p>

    <p>The Huaguo Shuilian Group also has business cooperation with the Jiugong family. Jiugong Liangzi also met Sun Rong at a family gathering. But that was a few years ago.</p>

    <p>"No...there is no such thing...the president is very good to us." The short-haired girl was frightened for a while.</p>

    <p>"Then why do your hands look like chicken feet? It looks like you have been engaged in writing work for a long time." Jiugong Liangzi sneered. Then he took out an unopened bottle of hand cream from his bag and gave it to the girl. Passed it over.</p>

    <p>This is Jiugong's special hand cream. It is made of pure natural ingredients. It is effective immediately. The effect is particularly good.</p>

    <p>It's not available in the market.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiugong Liangzi...this is..."</p>

    <p>"Don't get me wrong. I didn't give you anything just because your hands look like chicken feet. It's just the cost of guiding you."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said expressionlessly: "Then. Let's go."</p>

    <p>"Okay..." The girl with short hair was flattered...</p>

    <p>On the way, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way. What is your student union system like? How is the president elected?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it is an annual referendum. Of course, if you have any objections to the president's work, you can also conduct a public impeachment."</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Jiugong Liangzi nodded and said.</p>

    <p>"But why did classmate Liangzi ask that?" The short-haired girl was curious and had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>"Because I want to be the president."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi replied. Concisely and to the point.</p>
