  <h1>Chapter 1283 A person worse off than President Bai</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The ambulance arrived at the Sun family villa half an hour later.</p>

    <p>When the emergency doctor arrived, Fan Xing was still pinned under the bed.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you pull your young master out?"</p>

    <p>"What if I get a strain?" The bodyguards looked at each other.</p>

    <p>The reason why they didn't dare to move was not because of anything else. The main reason was that they were afraid of causing secondary harm to their young master.</p>

    <p>"If you pull it out, it will fracture again at most. In this situation, the edge of the bed directly compresses the back..."</p>

    <p>The emergency doctor did not dare to continue talking.</p>

    <p>Judging from his personal experience.</p>

    <p>Even if Fan Xing is eventually rescued, he will probably still be paralyzed.</p>

    <p>However, considering that Fan Xing is related to the Huaguo Shuilian Group after all.</p>

    <p>If the Huaguo Shuilian Group is willing to provide some good elixirs for improving the body.</p>

    <p>I can barely walk again. But I'm not sure about the other things...</p>

    <p>With the current cultivation medical technology, physical damage and bone fractures are not a big deal to cultivators.</p>

    <p>What I fear most is actually nerve damage.</p>

    <p>Even if Fan Xing can be rescued and regain the ability to walk, he will only become a cripple in the end.</p>

    <p>There may even be problems with balance.</p>

    <p>Not to mention flying with a sword. Running is also a problem.</p>

    <p>After a simple identification and bandaging, the emergency doctor directed the people at the scene to finally dig out Fan Xing, who had been pressed under the bed for a long time, and put him on a stretcher.</p>

    <p>"Doctor. What happened to my young master?"</p>

    <p>"I also want to ask you what's going on... why can the room look like a car accident scene even if you're asleep!"</p>

    <p>The bodyguard looked aggrieved: "It seemed like a doorknob top. The nail fell. The young master didn't pay attention. He stepped on the nail. Then he lost his balance due to severe pain and hit the bed. The whole bed turned over..."</p>

    <p>"Where is that door?" the doctor asked.</p>

    <p>"When I kicked in the door to save the young master, I accidentally stabbed him..." the bodyguard said.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The emergency doctor sighed. Then he made a preliminary assessment of Fan Xing's injuries.</p>

    <p>"The skull is shattered, and brain fluid mixed with blood seeps out from the cracks."</p>

    <p>"The sole of the foot was pierced by a black iron nail. There may be tetanus."</p>

    <p>"The spine is compressed. Causing intermittent shock."</p>

    <p>"Because I fell to the ground all of a sudden. The floor in the room is made of fine black stone. It is extremely hard. As a result, your young master's knee was shattered."</p>

    <p>"At the same time, there was also a rib that pierced the chest after being fractured. It was inexplicably inserted into the sac of the lower body..."</p>

    <p>"What pouch?"</p>

    <p>"A man... what else can he have?"</p>

    <p>When the emergency doctor said this, he couldn't help but feel sad in his heart.</p>

    <p>A rib can string together the contents of the bag like mutton kebabs...</p>

    <p>He had never seen such a magical operation.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is not the end.</p>

    <p>"The strangest thing is that there is still cotton wool in the mouth... I just used the scanning tool to take a brief look. Some of the cotton wool is blocked in the lungs and stomach. Surgery needs to be performed as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>"Then... then can my young master be saved..."</p>

    <p>The bodyguards looked shocked.</p>

    <p>With such a big incident happening to Fan Xing, they may not be able to keep their jobs.</p>

    <p>"This is also the strangest thing about me..."</p>

    <p>The emergency doctor glanced at Fan Xing on the stretcher.</p>

    <p>All these injuries are not considered fatal. But when added together, they are enough to kill a person.</p>

    <p>But the strangest thing is that Fan Xing is still breathing...</p>

    <p>He. Still living tenaciously...</p>

    <p>When the ambulance arrived at Sun's villa earlier, the emergency doctors already thought something was wrong. Because of the long distance, it took them a long time to get here.</p>

    <p>According to the bodyguard's description, Fan Xing's injury seems to be very serious. It should be said that there is no hope of treatment...</p>

    <p>Who knows, even with such serious injuries, Fan Xing is still breathing.</p>

    <p>"It seems everything is God's will."</p>

    <p>At this time, the emergency doctor stared at Fan Xing and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He feels that Fan Xing is really lucky.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for God's blessing, how could this man still be alive?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Fan Xing him. He walked peacefully.</p>

    <p>He was sent out of the Sun family villa lying on a stretcher.</p>

    <p>The accompanying bodyguards followed behind, crying and mourning.</p>

    <p>In the room of Sun Rong. Zhuo Yi looked at this scene from a distance. It felt as if Fan Xing was really dead.</p>

    <p>"Senior Heavenly Dao. Is he really still alive?" Zhuo Yi looked unbelievable.</p>

    <p>"Actually, rather than letting someone die, I'm actually better at pressing the blood line. That is to keep people in a half-dead state."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao said: "There used to be an old saying that evil people will be rewarded. This is actually true. For these evil people, I often come up with some blood-breaking methods to let them die after suffering painful punishment. and these people usually end up committing suicide."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Sun Rong school girl. What should we do next?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "The next thing is very simple. Senior Zhuo, please clean up everything in my room. Then find a secluded place to burn it with me."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "All burned?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought about it carefully: "Ah! There are two things that cannot be burned!"</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"Just keep my wardrobe and desk for now."</p>

    <p>It's not that the girl is reluctant to part with it. It's that there are some private clothes in the closet.</p>

    <p>It seems a bit inappropriate to take this out and burn it in broad daylight...</p>

    <p>As for the desk.</p>

    <p>The textbooks left inside are second to none.</p>

    <p>But the girl remembered the copybook she had secretly hidden earlier.</p>

    <p>The characters of Wang Ling are very beautiful.</p>

    <p>She has been imitating secretly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is the apprentice of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>How embarrassing would it be if senior Zhuo Yi saw him imitating Wang Ling's calligraphy...</p>

    <p>"What about the other stuff?"</p>

    <p>"It's all burned. Just buy more."</p>

    <p>"OK..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly. After all, this is the thinking of rich people.</p>

    <p>Use {Great Sacrifice Technique} in conjunction with Heavenly Dao of Death.</p>

    <p>Except for the two items specified by Sun Rong, which were not burned, Zhuo Yi almost burned everything in the girl's room.</p>

    <p>It is like moving Sun Rong's own room into the inner space of Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>"Want to burn WiFi?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"No need, Senior Zhuo. We can receive network signals here." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was stunned at first.</p>

    <p>But when I thought about it, it wasn't so strange.</p>

    <p>This Buddha Golden Lotus was originally something that the monk kept for himself for self-protection.</p>

    <p>It is estimated that the monk has also thought about the operation of surfing the Internet in the soul space.</p>

    <p>Nothing matters these days. Even if you die... you can't disconnect from the Internet!</p>

    <p>Therefore, the Buddha Space also comes with a private WiFi set up by Jin Deng himself. As long as you are in the Buddha Golden Lotus space, you can automatically connect.</p>

    <p>After restoring the Internet function, Sun Rong logged in to his account.</p>

    <p>Because he is the president of the student union. Sun Rong is the group leader of the 60 High School group.</p>

    <p>Regarding her matter, not to mention the class group, even the campus group had very lively discussions.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong was not in a hurry to report to everyone that he was safe.</p>

    <p>It's the same as Wang Ling. I learned to peek at the screen...</p>
