  <h1>Chapter 2083 The bustling sea area</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Cultivators from major countries with their own completely different cultivation cultures gathered on the sea. Some were busy hanging out, some were busy bowing, some were busy drinking, some were busy applying for World Heritage, and some were busy Fighting. Others gathered near the railing on the deck to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>If we say that cultivators from different countries in all mankind have their own regional characteristics and unique labels, then "eating melon" is a quality shared by all human cultivators.</p>

    <p>Not only Yue Lingwei, but also Zhang Zhui was surprised. Even Wang Muyu was looking around. He felt that the monks from other cultivation countries in front of him were really... quite individual.</p>

    <p>Such a collision of different cultures is a shock to adults, let alone a child like Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"It's rare to see such a scene."</p>

    <p>Only Yi Jianchuan was as calm as ever. He was sitting in the business class seat, with a calm expression on his face from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>As a rising star in the modern world of cultivation, the founding swordsman who witnessed the founding of the Huaxiu Kingdom step by step thousands of years ago and made immortal achievements. He has witnessed the rise, fall and evolution of many cultivation countries. He has also seen the ups and downs of too many people's hearts.</p>

    <p>This is not what Zhang Zhui, Wang Muyu or Yue Lingwei can have.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei is the "real clone" of Wang Ling. Most of his understanding of modern cultivation still remains at the level of the original owner's experience.</p>

    <p>It is rare to see such a scene where the cultures of multiple cultivating countries collide.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui came from eternity. His understanding of the modern world of cultivation is not too deep.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Muyu, let alone that.</p>

    <p>Today is a learning opportunity for these three people.</p>

    <p>There was a lot of excitement ahead because of the anchorage of the Immortal ship. Fortunately, the situation was quickly resolved. After the navigation was restored to normal, the monks from various countries made peace one after another with the persuasion of peacemakers.</p>

    <p>Conflicts and collisions between cultures are normal. The two major cultivator countries, Xiuxiu and Mixiu, took their respective subordinates to travel into the restricted sea area this time. It is unrealistic not to have some conflicts.</p>

    <p>When the route became clear, the lively atmosphere never cooled down. Perhaps it had been a long time since such a large number of earthly monks had entered the restricted area of the sea. Moreover, they were monks from different cultivation countries. It suddenly made the place very lively.</p>

    <p>And in addition to the immortal ships representing the major cultivation countries, there are also many casual cultivator ships behind them. Although they do not look as high-tech as the official immortal ships of the cultivation countries, they are still following at full speed as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Before, Yue Lingwei persuaded a large number of people to leave. But after all, some people who did not believe in evil still came in.</p>

    <p>They followed dozens of immortal ships from the cultivating countries. And the major cultivating countries did not stop them. Because no one knew the dangers of the restricted sea area. At this time, it is always right to join a group to keep warm.</p>

    <p>For Mixiu Emperor, the more people, the better.</p>

    <p>What he wanted was to find out who was behind the conspiracy. The Venerated Immortal he had dug up was seriously injured.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei operates the Xiaobailong maritime high-speed rail, running in parallel with the fleets of the major cultivating countries, but maintaining a relatively long parallel distance.</p>

    <p>He wanted to be low-key. But the moment he took this thing out, it was already destined to not be low-key...</p>

    <p>The fleet group soon noticed the high-speed maritime train running parallel to itself. All the monks in the Xiuzhen Kingdom were shocked.</p>

    <p>High-speed rail... can actually go to the sea?</p>

    <p>They were surprised by the black technology vehicle Yue Lingwei pulled out at once.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that it is too exaggerated. Sixteen carriages are driving on the sea. It looks like a swimming dragon swimming freely in the sea. The key is that it is very flexible in terms of speed and maneuverability.</p>

    <p>"Which country is this monk from?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know. It looks like a casual cultivator."</p>

    <p>The monks in the fleet group were discussing. They were observing from a long distance. They did not find any signs of the cultivation country on this maritime high-speed train. There were no family, sect or organization signs. It looked like it had just left the factory. The whole thing is just a little white dragon in the waves. There is nothing.</p>

    <p>No one has studied the origin of this strange maritime high-speed rail in detail.</p>

    <p>Because it is right in front of the sea restricted area. You can see a large area of gray-white buildings. This large area of sea buildings has been stationed here for a long time. The buildings are rusty and full of traces of being washed away by the times. You can see groups of them. Iron-eating sharks are wandering nearby. They are golden yellow all over. They are even more spectacular under the sunlight. They swim in groups near the building.</p>

    <p>They are spiritual beasts whose history can be traced back to ancient times. They are spiritual beasts that have lived on the earth for a long time. At first, they lived on various trace elements in seawater. Now they have evolved to chew iron directly.</p>

    <p>"Why are there still buildings in the sea zone?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was very curious.</p>

    <p>"They are all from the old times. Before the Sea Forbidden Zone was banned, this Fortress was used as an experimental base for various cultivation countries to study the Sea Forbidden Zone. However, after all the human monks withdrew, the fortress was abandoned. Already."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan said: "Originally, this fortress was very large. It was a huge sea city. Now it has been eaten down by this iron-eating shark and only this is left."</p>

    <p>When he said this, you could see that many ships from the Xiuzhen Kingdom had stopped in front of the fortress. They were casting nets in an attempt to catch iron-eating sharks.</p>

    <p>This is a unique creature in the marine restricted area. And today's iron-eating sharks are very big. Catching them is a sure-profit business.</p>

    <p>"They came here just to fish? How come they have forgotten what they came here to do?" Wang Muyu laughed.</p>

    <p>"Whether it is to seek revenge for Hong Siqi or because he thinks there is a secret in this restricted area, it is essentially for profit. This iron-eating shark is worth a lot of money, and it is exclusive to the restricted area. Now it is difficult to get in. Of course it is. There is no reason to miss." The sword master said.</p>

    <p>The most valuable part of the iron-eating shark is the fish roe in its belly. Each particle is golden and as big as a pearl. Although they eat iron all year round, the fish roe in their belly has no fishy smell at all and is sweet. Silky and dense in taste. Not only is it a very high-end ingredient, but it is also the main ingredient in alchemy.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that these fish seeds can also be used to make a very important substance... Sword Spirit Awakening Liquid!</p>

    <p>"Sword Spirit Awakening... Liquid? Is there such a thing?" Wang Muyu was shocked.</p>

    <p>Because he himself knows the key to the awakening of the sword spirit. It is only after developing a certain relationship with the spirit sword that he can summon the sword spirit that matches him from the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Essentially, sword spirits are products of the chaos of the universe. They are unlikely to be cultivated through nurture.</p>

    <p>"I can only say that it is theoretically possible." Yi Jianchuan said, "Because modern cultivation scientists have discovered that the roe of the iron-eating shark can react with specific alien soil, giving it the ability to communicate with the chaos of the universe. Smear it on the spirit sword. It can accelerate the perception of the spirit sword and the sword spirit... Therefore, the value of a tube of sword spirit awakening fluid is also sky-high. It requires a total of 10 million immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"So teacher, tell me the truth. Is this really useful?"</p>

    <p>"I said, it's theoretically possible. And the effective ingredient is difficult to extract. Muyu. Have you ever tasted egg soup?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Then have you ever tasted seawater egg soup?"</p>

    <p>"I understand. Teacher..."</p>
