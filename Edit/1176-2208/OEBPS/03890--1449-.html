  <h1>Chapter 1449 Popular Citizen Scientist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the saying goes, when Brother Hei smiles, life or death is unpredictable.</p>

    <p>Created by Brother Chong, it ascends to heaven and explodes.</p>

    <p>Taking advantage of Fan Xing's last suicide attempt, the "Fully Automatic Escape Apartment" designed by Shou Chong became very popular.</p>

    <p>Together with Shou Chong himself, he directly rushed to the forefront of popular private traffic scientists.</p>

    <p>As one of the representatives of the new generation of demon exorcists, Jiugong Liangzi has always had a strong interest in cutting-edge technology.</p>

    <p>Including the Jiugong family's current exorcism of demons. Many aspects have been integrated with modern science. Technological intervention is used to complete various tasks. As a result, the customer satisfaction rate has also been greatly improved.</p>

    <p>The matter of Jiugong Liangzi summoning Shou Chong this time was actually decided long before Jiugong came to Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>In other words, before Shou Chong became as popular as it is now, the Jiugong family had already been connected with Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>While Shou Chong was waiting in the living room on the first floor, the maid of the villa served a carefully prepared plug.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, Jiugong Liangzi put on a purple maple leaf-style kimono and walked slowly downstairs on wooden clogs.</p>

    <p>On the back of the kimono is the crow crest of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as Jiugong's carefully prepared dress out of respect for scientists.</p>

    <p>After coming downstairs, her purple eyes locked on Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>This was the first time she saw Shou Chong's Zhenren. She was a little surprised that Shou Chong was as unkempt as in the photo.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a pair of straw sandals and a yellowish white coat. His face was unshaven, and even his hair was a mess of seaweed.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt that his favorability was instantly wiped away a lot.</p>

    <p>She met a total of three people today.</p>

    <p>Leaving aside Sun Rong. The remaining ones are Zhuo Yi and Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>Although the liar Zhuo Yi is very annoying, but in terms of first impression, Jiugong feels that he is really many times better than Shou Chong...</p>

    <p>At least. That's a clean man.</p>

    <p>"Miss... Otherwise, I'd better let him go back." The female bodyguard felt something was wrong in the atmosphere and whispered.</p>

    <p>"I invited him here. How can I let him go back so easily?" Jiugong Liangzi frowned.</p>

    <p>Now, she had no choice but to bite the bullet...</p>

    <p>Because Shou Chong had a very strange smell. Jiugong Liangzi chose to sit on the sofa several steps away.</p>

    <p>The result was disastrous. She had just sat down on her side. Shou Chong's butt automatically moved towards her as if it were on a pulley.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>"Hello, Miss Jiugong." Shou Chong chuckled: "Although this is our first meeting, I actually brought a lot of experimental magic weapons that have not yet been put into mass production. For example, just now, when you saw me, I automatically moved closer to you. This is actually the effect of the [Social Nano Underwear] that I invented."</p>

    <p>"Social... Nano underwear..."</p>

    <p>"There have been frequent flu outbreaks recently. During this epidemic, it is actually very important to maintain good social distance."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong began to introduce his product: "And this [Social Nano Underwear] can automatically keep a distance of about one meter from the person it touches. You don't even need to walk. You just need to sit like this. Your butt will be It's like it has a pulley. It approaches automatically..."</p>

    <p>"What if the other party runs away?" The female bodyguard asked a very curious question.</p>

    <p>"That's a good question, young lady." Shou Chong said: "If you run away, of course you will catch up automatically. As fast as the opponent runs, your butt moves as fast as possible. So the flaw of this product is that if it moves too fast. The strong friction can easily burn your butt."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>She suppressed her urge to curse and tried hard to maintain the dignity of a young lady.</p>

    <p>After all, she invited the person here. She couldn't lose her temper just because she didn't agree with him.</p>

    <p>Also, Jiugong Liangzi actually investigated Shou Chong beforehand. He knew that Shou Chong had accumulated many useless inventions...</p>

    <p>But whether these inventions are useful or not is not the key.</p>

    <p>What Jiugong Liangzi likes is Shou Chong's unique design ideas.</p>

    <p>"Master Shou Chong should know. What is the purpose of my coming to you."</p>

    <p>"I have always heard that the Jiugong family is attacking the demon exorcism and exorcism market in Huaxiu." Shou Chong smiled.</p>

    <p>After he became popular these days, he has actually been looking for a suitable partner to mass-produce his inventions and creations.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family took the initiative to contact him a long time ago.</p>

    <p>He thought this was a good opportunity.</p>

    <p>He also worked with Fan Xing before. However, Fan Xing has evil intentions. Moreover, he seems to be cursed by something evil. He has to go to the hospital every two days. It is really evil.</p>

    <p>Good birds choose trees to roost in.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong has long wanted to change his work place.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing no matter how rich a person is.</p>

    <p>How can it be compared to the support of the entire Jiugong family?</p>

    <p>"As long as the Jiugong family can use my products, I think they will be even more powerful in the business of exorcism and exorcism. Now, let me introduce..."</p>

    <p>"Master, wait a moment."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi did not intend to let Shou Chong continue the introduction. Instead, he planned to get straight to the point: "We do need some high-end scientific research products to help our Jiugong family expand the market. But does the magic weapon developed by the master meet the needs of our Jiugong family?. It's hard to say these things yet."</p>

    <p>"If Ms. Jiugong needs to customize a magic weapon, that's also possible. You might as well tell me your thoughts." Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>"I need to find a boy with dead fish eyes. But it's been six years now. This boy is now 16 years old."</p>

    <p>"Are there any relevant clues?"</p>

    <p>"The only clue I have at the moment is that this boy may be in the high school I am about to transfer to." Jiugong Liangzi frowned: "And I'm not sure whether he has had plastic surgery on himself."</p>

    <p>"Plastic surgery doesn't matter. You can change your appearance, but you can't change your genes. If there is genetic data related to this boy, it may be much easier to find." Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>"The only clue we have right now is the testimony of a Day-traveling ghost."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said with a headache: "Comparatively, it was just a boy at that time. His facial features were not fully developed. The Jiugong family also found many masters to predict what the boy would look like when he grew up based on the description of the Day-traveling ghost. The result was not. Reliable."</p>

    <p>"So. What is Miss Jiugong's request?" Shou Chong felt that something was interesting.</p>

    <p>"I hope the master can develop a magic weapon to help me find this dead fish-eyed boy."</p>

    <p>"It's difficult... and the research and development costs..."</p>

    <p>"Is five billion enough?"</p>

    <p>"Deal."</p>
