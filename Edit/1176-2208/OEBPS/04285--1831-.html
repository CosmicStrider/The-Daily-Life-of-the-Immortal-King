  <h1>Chapter 1831 Wang Ying's Treaty</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gets taken out...</p>

    <p>Even though the Era Pointer had been used, the creation-level chaos weapon also suffered a devastating blow from the opponent's headbutt.</p>

    <p>He is the sixth protector of the Saint Clan. He is the most talented young generation among the Saint Clan. He has been taught by the Saint King and is the favorite of the Saint Clan. He has never taken extraterrestrial life outside the Saint Clan seriously. Gui Laoliu never expected that he would be defeated like this.</p>

    <p>The severe pain of losing half of his body made it difficult for him to calm down in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>He vomited blood. Most of his body was destroyed. This was not completely fatal to his constitution. However, it would take a huge price to fully recover.</p>

    <p>Confrontations between masters often do not require excuses. Even though Gui Laoliu was dissatisfied, he also understood that if Wang Ling's headbutt just now had been more accurate... he would be killed directly, and he would not even be qualified to stand here.</p>

    <p>The life gate of the saint people is in the upper body. Only when the upper body is completely destroyed does it herald death. Otherwise, every remaining cell has the possibility of recovery.</p>

    <p>"Laoliu actually lost?"</p>

    <p>On the other side of the universe, the other saints who were watching the battle all showed incredulous expressions. They had never thought that an earth cultivator could be so powerful.</p>

    <p>This era pointer is the treasure that the Holy King keeps at the bottom of the box. It was given directly to Gui Laoliu for self-defense. He thought that using it at this critical moment would definitely reverse the decline and directly win him a comprehensive victory.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the pointer was set to half a century later. The young man from Earth who would never age before him became even more "brutal" than before.</p>

    <p>"How could the sixth brother lose... Is this person really from Earth? Why do I feel so weird?" A woman's voice came from among the remaining five guardians. She is the fourth guardian, and she is also a ghost. The fourth sister in the eyes of the sixth child.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Holy King, the person who took the most care of Gui Laoliu was the Fourth Protector. Now seeing Gui Laoliu's tragic defeat, the Fourth Protector, who was controlled by his disciples, became obviously anxious. He even began to question Wang Ling's identity.</p>

    <p>This can't be entirely blamed on people's suspicion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is indeed too powerful. It is beyond the scope of a living being's understanding of a normal earth cultivator. And it has an illusion that refreshes people's worldview.</p>

    <p>"Can't you afford to lose?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying's voice came from within Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>The physical work Wang Ling has been completed. The remaining negotiation work is left. It is most appropriate for Wang Ying to take over.</p>

    <p>At the same time as the cold voice came out, a jet black outline appeared on Wang Ling's body instantly. Then it turned into a black shadow and formed a figure with the same face as Wang Ling on the side.</p>

    <p>Below. The people watching at Number 60 High School were dumbfounded again.</p>

    <p>"Is this... a shadow clone?" Guo Hao was confused.</p>

    <p>"It's very similar. The hair color is different. It's white." Chen Chao frowned. Looking at it, he said: "And I feel that his personality is different from that of Lingzi. It feels very perverted."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Hearing this, she immediately felt that Chinese culture is deep and profound.</p>

    <p>Obviously, this "pervert" has completely different meanings from the "pervert" used described Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>In the void, Wang Ying heard Chen Chao's description. The corner of his mouth just twitched. For the sake of being a classmate of Number 60 High School, he didn't attack.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Ying'er, who was dormant in Sun Rong's body, immediately burst into laughter: "Hahaha. This big **** didn't expect to be here today!"</p>

    <p>Faced with Wang Ying's sudden appearance, the saints on the other side of the universe clearly showed a vigilant look. They could tell that Wang Ying was not weak, and he seemed to have a bad temper. He was less likely to be provoked than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"We don't know what tricks you have played. The battle just now does not count! If you are capable, fight us again. We will send someone from our side. If you win, this era pointer can be given to you!" A saint tribesman opened his mouth. It was still the Fourth Protector.</p>

    <p>"What do we want with that needle?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying laughed. He waved his hand and snapped his fingers. Immediately, a dusty treasure in King's Pants appeared in front of everyone in the form of a projection.</p>

    <p>This is a majestic clock tower. The huge pendulum and clock dial exude an aura of immortality. The entire clock tower makes up for the law of time. It is dozens of times that of the era pointer!</p>

    <p>"Era Bell Tower..."</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu and the people from the Holy Clan were shocked.</p>

    <p>They recognized the origin of this chaos device. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be the legendary Era Clock Tower... which is one of the three-piece set of the Law of Time (Era Pointer, Era Clock Dial, and Era Clock Tower).</p>

    <p>The era pointer is in their hands. This is the smallest component.</p>

    <p>And the Era Clock Dial and Era Clock Tower collected in King's Pants have been merged together...</p>

    <p>So there are no pointers to them. It really doesn't mean much to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Then what do you think..." These saints were at a loss for words. They were completely dumbfounded. They thought they were wealthy enough and used the era pointer as a bet in an attempt to fight again. But they didn't expect that Wang Ling and Wang Ying were even more aggressive here. He directly moved the bell tower.</p>

    <p>"Our request is very simple. Let's talk about the additional conditions first. Then let's talk about the main conditions."</p>

    <p>"Are there any additional conditions?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. Whether you listen or not is your business. If you don't listen..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying laughed. He looked like a ghost. He put a hand on the shoulder of Gui Laoliu who was repairing his injury.</p>

    <p>This is a threat, because there is a huge energy in his palm. As long as he exerts a little force, Gui Laoliu will explode immediately. There is no possibility of survival.</p>

    <p>"Don't be impulsive! You have something to say!" As the group favorite of the Saints, the Saints from the other side of the universe naturally don't want to see Gui Laoliu die in battle like that.</p>

    <p>"There are three additional conditions."</p>

    <p>Seeing that negotiations had been formed, Wang Ying said: "First, ask your Holy King to abandon the Tengu. No longer be allowed to intervene in the disputes between cultivators on earth. And release the actual control of the Tengu. Give it to the person we designate."</p>

    <p>"Second. The three royal Eternals you sent earlier. The Skeleton Prince, the Lion-headed Man and Meng Liuli from the Dream Tribe. These three are now our prisoners. And they have agreed to join us. You are not allowed to take them back. go."</p>

    <p>"Third, you are not allowed to form alliances with other cosmic forces that are unfavorable to the earth. If we find out about this, your holy family will not be able to gain a foothold in the universe. The destruction of the family is only the lightest thing."</p>

    <p>After saying these three additional conditions, the saints on the other side of the universe fell silent for a moment. They dared not speak out in anger.</p>

    <p>At this point Wang Ying coughed slightly and put forward the last major condition: "The last major condition is also very simple. You have lost this battle after all, so you need to compensate for some mental damage."</p>

    <p>The Saints gritted their teeth. The great protector with a rough voice said, "Tell me. How much do you want? Or how many spiritual stones."</p>

    <p>"Very cheap."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying spoke and said with a smile: "One Cosmic Embryo is enough."</p>
