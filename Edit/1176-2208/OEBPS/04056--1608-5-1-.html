  <h1>Chapter 1608 Wang Ling's hunky rabbit ears</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The idea of Father Wang and Mother Wang is not just a simple talk...</p>

    <p>But for real.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling realized that Ah Nuan would really go to school with him tomorrow.</p>

    <p>There was still a bit of panic in my heart.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan did not follow Wang Ling in his true form. Instead, he was just like when he fought side by side with Wang Ling in the supreme world. He separated into a shadow and lay on Wang Ling's shoulder.</p>

    <p>What the shadow hears, learns, and various sensory perceptions can all be fed back to the body simultaneously during this process.</p>

    <p>And. low-level cultivators.</p>

    <p>That is, those classmates and alumni of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The existence of Ah Nuan is invisible.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Your dad and I will keep an eye on Ah Nuan's body. Don't worry about Ah Nuan peeing on you." Before going to bed, Mother Wang introduced the situation to Wang Ling in a serious manner.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He's worried...</p>

    <p>It's not about my sister pooping or peeing!</p>

    <p>It's true that he has Talisman in his body. But the problem is that Ah Nuan doesn't have it in him yet! Even if it's a shadow, that's scary!</p>

    <p>Who the hell would carry a "nuclear bomb" to school!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling supports the amount.</p>

    <p>I feel like I have a headache.</p>

    <p>However, Father Wang and Mother Wang were extremely firm on this matter. He himself also felt extremely helpless.</p>

    <p>So he could only find Wang Ming to help.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming has now returned to his laboratory. Wang Ling Remember that there is actually a backup seal of Talisman in the laboratory. The strength is higher than the one-time seal.</p>

    <p>However, compatibility... Wang Ling cannot actually be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Although he and Ah Nuan are biological siblings, they have different models.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know if sealing Talisman has any effect on Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, Wang Ming seems to be particularly curious.</p>

    <p>"By the way! Now you have reminded me of my order. I thought before that I should do a Talisman experiment for Ah Nuan girl. Why not try it this time? It will also help me promote the follow-up. New Talisman research. It can be regarded as reference data."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said excitedly.</p>

    <p>When he returned to Huaxiu earlier, he remembered what he had not done. However, when he was asked by Wang Ling, he suddenly remembered it.</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way. There are two tests this time. Why don't we do them together?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming said again.</p>

    <p>"After I returned to the laboratory, I extracted a substance from the mysterious black stone. Then I diluted it into a black spiritual liquid."</p>

    <p>"This spiritual liquid has a strong inhibitory effect. Dropping it on a magic weapon can make the magic weapon have a sealing effect in a short period of time."</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. I just broke a dozen sacred artifacts here..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Didn't the golden pacifier you want to give to Ah Nuan be enlightened by you? I don't think it will be damaged by the black liquid."</p>

    <p>"How about you ask Ah Nuan to cooperate and conduct a test on this black spirit liquid? I want to see how far it can be suppressed."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Safe... Of course it's safe! Don't you believe these things your brother invented!" Wang Ming crossed his arms and said solemnly: "The worst result is that the earth explodes. At worst, you can wait until after the explosion. Bring it back..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not a demon after all. It is impossible to really use his own sister as a guinea pig.</p>

    <p>The stability of the black spiritual liquid extracted from the black stone is currently unknown. If the effect is too strong, it may cause some uncomfortable reactions. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive.</p>

    <p>For example, when Wang Ling first wore the sealed Talisman, the original version of the sealed Talisman gave Wang Ling a very uncomfortable feeling. As a result, Wang Ling's body accumulated psychic energy, which directly tore the seal apart. Caused massive power outages around the world and electrical damage in core areas.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was still young at that time... Fortunately, it was just a power outage and some electrical appliances were damaged.</p>

    <p>So the most distressing ones are those programmers with their hair pulled back in front of the computer screen.</p>

    <p>I have worked hard to invent and create a program for a long time. However, the screen in front of me suddenly blacked out and nothing happened.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling decided to try this black liquid for yourself first.</p>

    <p>If there are no adverse reactions, help Ah Nuan put the drops on the golden pacifier.</p>

    <p>This pacifier was chosen as a gift for Ah Nuan by Wang Ling on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Originally it was not gold, but pink gold.</p>

    <p>The market value is 980,000 Sun Island coins.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling bought it without even thinking about it.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Ling didn't expect was that the pink gold pacifier would turn into gold after being enlightened by himself. It didn't look fashionable at all. It even had the feeling of being from a wealthy family.</p>

    <p>He thought Ah Nuan would be annoying.</p>

    <p>In the end, the little girl didn't dislike it at all.</p>

    <p>Early morning on Tuesday, December 21st.</p>

    <p>A drone stopped at the window door of Wang Ling. Wang Ming sent the spare Talisman in the laboratory and the original liquid of black spirit liquid to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This bottle of original solution is only 5 ml.</p>

    <p>Contained in a special bottle. It looks like only a little bit.</p>

    <p>Touching it through the bottle. Wang Ling didn't feel anything special about the black liquid.</p>

    <p>He took out a drop and put it on his enlightened 60 High School uniform jacket.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. A circle of special black energy spread out like ripples from the school uniform. This energy turned into silk threads and completely penetrated the school uniform jacket he called without leaving any gaps.</p>

    <p>The whole process. Wang Ling and Wang Nuan watched quietly.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan bit the golden pacifier given by Wang Ling. He lay on Wang Ling's shoulder. He had a thoughtful expression. He seemed to be a little troubled by the situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>After a while, Wang Ling reached out to touch his school uniform jacket.</p>

    <p>I felt like I was being electrostatically charged. My fingertips were numb. But I didn't feel any pain at all.</p>

    <p>He didn't hesitate. He took his coat and put it on as usual.</p>

    <p>After about a few seconds, some changes began to happen to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just above his head, a pair of rabbit ears actually grew, hanging down from his head.</p>

    <p>This shocked Wang Nuan who was originally lying on his shoulder. But after calming down, the little girl quickly and boldly reached out to touch the pair of rabbits grown by Wang Ling... I found that my ears were so soft that I could actually feel the bones!</p>

    <p>Is this... an adverse reaction of black ectoplasm?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was confused.</p>

    <p>But soon, he gave up the idea...</p>

    <p>There is no adverse reaction to growing animal ears!</p>

    <p>It's 100% the fault of that guy Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>Just when he was about to send a text message to question Wang Ming, Wang Ming sent him a message directly as if he had figured it out: "Ah, by the way. I am researching an [animal reagent] here that can make the human body grow. Part of the animal's structure achieves a cute effect. I have always wanted to experiment with you before. So I mixed the reagent with the black spiritual liquid."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Don't take off your coat! It's very important to ensure the experimental data. If you take off your coat, I will have to do the experiment again next time."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling saw the text message and couldn't help but take a breath of air.</p>

    <p>What is the devil...</p>

    <p>This is the real devil.</p>

    <p>By developing the new Talisman, he actually did something to him!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he must record this matter in a small notebook. One day he will fight back.</p>

    <p>After returning from Sun Island, Wang Ling felt that his sense of existence was getting higher and higher. Now he has bunny ears... If he goes to school, he will be laughed at to death.</p>

    <p>The key is that his sister is lying on his shoulder and watching his jokes!</p>

    <p>With a bit of resentment, Wang Ling came to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.</p>

    <p>As a result, I unexpectedly discovered these drooping bunny ears on my head. They are quite cute...</p>

    <p>And it doesn't even look like he's wearing a cosplayer's ear.</p>

    <p>But why bunny ears?</p>

    <p>Is it because he often wears bunny pajamas?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling is feeling extremely anxious.</p>

    <p>Especially when he appeared at the school gate like this, I felt even more uneasy.</p>

    <p>Today, the person responsible for standing at the school gate to do the school inspection is none other than the meticulous Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>After more than one semester of contact with Teacher Pan, Wang Ling has a deep understanding of this person's character.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan has always been an old-fashioned conservative. He doesn't like students doing fancy things.</p>

    <p>For example, let's take a boy's hairstyle. Either it's a crew cut like Chen Chao's. Even if you have hair with bangs, it shouldn't be too long. What stands out is the word refreshing.</p>

    <p>As for the girls, Teacher Pan prefers short hair that reaches the ears. If you insist on having long hair, it is not impossible. Her request is that at least it should not be let down. It is best to tie it into a ponytail.</p>

    <p>Now I have a rabbit that comes to school</p>

    <p>I can't take these ears off for a while. Wang Ling feels that there is a high chance that I will be criticized by Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>He bowed silently at the school gate. Wang Ling moved forward with his head lowered. He was about to lead the cute little sister who was lying on his shoulders to pass the test.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, Teacher Pan's serious voice suddenly came from behind: "Wang Ling. Just wait!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately stopped.</p>

    <p>If the eternal warriors in Corpse Map saw this scene, they would definitely feel sad.</p>

    <p>The immortal king who just recently beat Fenmu Shen, who inherited the bloodline of the Outer God Sotos, to the ground. He actually stopped in his tracks because of the head teacher's voice.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... the strongest humans in this universe are still the teachers in the school!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Why do I feel like you are a little high-shouldered?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Nuan: "..."</p>

    <p>High and low shoulders are normal...</p>

    <p>Because Ah Nuan girl is lying on his right shoulder!</p>

    <p>Although this is just a shadow, the shadow is really extremely heavy!</p>

    <p>Although the shadow shares half of the weight of Ah Nuan's body, it still weighs more than 40,000 kilograms...</p>

    <p>Seeing Teacher Pan calling out to him at this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Nuan were both shocked.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Teacher Pan stretched out his hand.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan instantly became more alert.</p>

    <p>In the end, Teacher Pan just walked over and gently tapped Wang Ling's back: "Don't be hunched over. Boys should walk straight to look energetic."</p>

    <p>"eh..."Wang Ling nodded and agreed.</p>

    <p>He was about to leave. But then Teacher Pan suddenly stopped him again: "Wait a minute! What's going on with that thing on your head?"</p>

    <p>As soon as this voice came out, Wang Ling knew immediately. Everything was over.</p>

    <p>Being stopped and lectured so humiliatingly at the school gate will definitely become the focus of Number 60 High School today.</p>

    <p>The result was unexpected. Teacher Pan, who had always been serious, actually laughed out loud in the next second: "Wang Ling. That's okay! Rabbit ears! What a macho rabbit!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>She reached out and stroked Wang Ling's ears. Is it a temporary after-effect of practicing magic in private?"</p>

    <p>It's a real animal organ. Teacher Pan is actually not to blame.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't realize that Teacher Pan thought that way.</p>

    <p>I thought he practiced some other magic in private, which resulted in this kind of sequelae.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. This temporary ear will disappear in a few hours." Teacher Pan couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>As a teaching pioneer at Number 60 High School. In fact, many similar things have happened in the school in the past years.</p>

    <p>Many physical techniques and spells developed with spiritual beasts as inspiration will cause monks to have intermittent sequelae when their practice is not in place or when their practice is too in-depth.</p>

    <p>That is, growing the organs of an animal.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan at Number 60 High School saw many examples of this. There were students and teachers.</p>

    <p>In modern Cultivation Academy, there is nothing surprising.</p>

    <p>There are many side effects of spells.</p>

    <p>In fact, sometimes the sequelae of animalization like this are just a little embellishment of the cultivation life.</p>

    <p>It's a lot better than the rulers of some cultures going around without masks and getting infected with new pandemic viruses. It's not clear what the consequences of contracting the new epidemic virus will be.</p>

    <p>Maybe it will cause a mental shock. So you can inject disinfectant and bleach into your arm...</p>

    <p>These days, even elementary school students know that this is something that cannot be done. But some people actually try it.</p>

    <p>This is the most outrageous!</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>The side effects of animalization are actually nothing to Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>As long as you don't intentionally wear that kind of cosplay headgear, Teacher Pan will never say another word.</p>

    <p>No problem...</p>

    <p>At this moment, I saw that Wang Ling had grown a pair of bunny ears. Teacher Pan even thought that it would be good if Wang Ling could keep it forever.</p>

    <p>This has been more than a semester. Wang Ling doesn't like to talk, and she has a very clear personality of being taciturn.</p>

    <p>Such cute rabbit ears grow on Wang Ling. There is really an indescribable contrast in cuteness.</p>

    <p>"fine."</p>

    <p>Before letting Wang Ling leave, Teacher Pan made the above two-word evaluation of Wang Ling's rabbit. He did so with a smile. Seeing this made Wang Ling feel guilty.</p>

    <p>And looking at Wang Ling's leaving figure, Teacher Pan couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. As expected, he was not disappointed.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, students who take time to study spells in private are mostly pursuing their studies.</p>

    <p>During these days as a class teacher, Wang Ling's grades have always been at an average level.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan is a little skeptical now...</p>

    <p>Is this guy trying to score points?</p>

    <p>How can a person who studies so hard get an average score every time? It is too unrealistic.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For a whole week Wang Ling and Sun Rong were studying on Sun Island as exchange students. There was no homework to write or make up, they lived in the best room, enjoyed the best beauty and even brought together a lot of Gray Cultists.</p>

    <p>There was even an extra scholarship awarded by the school after returning... This is something that is definitely a source of hatred for some hard-working students who are still catching up on their homework during the National Day holiday. Wang Ling's group of exchange students son.</p>

    <p>As a result of not seeing each other for a long time, they naturally became the new focus after returning to school.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong also takes this into consideration.</p>

    <p>He was worried that Wang Ling would be surrounded by a group of people as soon as he came to school. He might not be used to it, so he came to school early to answer many people's questions.</p>

    <p>"My classmate, Sun Rong, I heard that Jiudaohe High School on Sun Island has a student who has already reached the golden core in his freshman year?"</p>

    <p>"Is xenophobia serious? Are they friendly to us? I still want to travel next year!"</p>

    <p>"Is the food in Jiudaohe cafeteria delicious? How does it compare to our Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Every question Sun Rong was answered in detail.</p>

    <p>As long as she answers clearly, many people who have asked for the answer will naturally stop harassing Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Of course. Among the above questions, there are also some gossips that Sun Rong doesn't know how to answer...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong! Is there a real octopus in the octopus balls on Sun Island!"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong! Is Satomi Ishihara really married? Do I still have a chance!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These questions.Sun Rong can only smile and laugh.</p>

    <p>She herself doesn't pay much attention to the problems of these idol stars.</p>

    <p>After all, with the financial resources of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, there is no idol star that cannot be invited. This is not the least bit strange to Sun Rong... After all, she has ten pieces of pocket money a month. As much as 100 million. As long as she is willing, it is not a problem to change celebrities to come to the school every day to deliver the lunch broadcast.</p>

    <p>After answering everyone's questions while maintaining a calm attitude as much as possible, Sun Rong felt himself let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Next. There won't be so many people harassing Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>However, what she never expected was...</p>

    <p>When she turned around and looked at the back table, Wang Ling was actually surrounded by a large group of people!</p>

    <p>The key is that these people are not here to ask questions. They are here to watch Wang Ling's bunny ears!</p>

    <p>"This..." Sun Rong watched this scene from a distance. She didn't know what was going on with Wang Ling's bunny ears. But she was still blushing! She felt like her whole body was about to be shaken by Wang Ling's bunny ears. Wang Ling got carried away!</p>

    <p>She couldn't help but roar in her heart.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The girlish heart that was ready to move overflowed.</p>

    <p>This is... too cute!!!</p>

    <p>The group of people surrounding Wang Ling also exclaimed from time to time.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Awsl! So cute! Those are real bunny ears!"</p>

    <p>"I'll rub Wang Ling. These rabbit ears don't match you normally! Are they really the sequelae of practicing magic? Are you sure you didn't use any medicine? You did it on purpose!" Chen Chao couldn't help but stretched out his hand and pulled it. The furry touch made him feel relaxed and happy.</p>

    <p>"It's really cute." Guo Hao also praised.</p>

    <p>He felt that his spiritual pet store should buy more rabbits of different types.</p>

    <p>Originally, he had no interest in the rabbit spirit beast.</p>

    <p>But after seeing Wang Ling, I suddenly felt that the rabbit was very cute!</p>

    <p>You can also raise little rabbits!</p>

    <p>Instead of just serving them to the table!</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone's thoughts are actually the same.</p>

    <p>They say that young pig-headed boys will not dream of bunny girls...</p>

    <p>They suddenly thought that it would be great if Wang Ling could keep bunny ears forever!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that he would be completely overwhelmed by the crowd on his first day back to school. But in fact, this kind of crowding did not last even for the first class.</p>

    <p>Because the first class was the class of Monk Jin Deng disguised as Teacher Huo Ding.</p>

    <p>As soon as Jin Deng came out, he gave everyone a set of animal transformation spells.</p>

    <p>Since everyone is animalized, the rabbit ears of Wang Ling are naturally not alien.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as Jin Deng smoothing things over for him.</p>

    <p>But in fact. This course was also proposed by Sun Rong to Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, the girl feels that it is not good for Wang Ling to be constantly surrounded.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, when she saw some girls touching Wang Ling's bunny ears, she felt a full sense of resistance in her heart!</p>

    <p>Just watch and watch!</p>

    <p>How did you get started with this?</p>

    <p>One by one... Have you never seen a rabbit in the zoo?</p>

    <p>Just a pair of bunny ears...</p>

    <p>Ah!</p>

    <p>I really want to touch it too!</p>

    <p>With this thought, Sun Rong was completely going crazy.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent those girls from attacking Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>Her mind immediately changed and she entrusted Monk Jin Deng to take such a course.</p>

    <p>So, after the "Animal Transformation Spell" tutorial, the entire Grade 1 and 3 classes completely turned into a zoo.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao has grown a pair of horns and an ox tail, which is particularly in line with this person's style.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao seems to have completely merged with his parrot Er Dan. The hair on his head has turned into a parrot color.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong has the biggest change.</p>

    <p>Not to mention a pair of fluffy snow-white fox ears sprouted from the top of his head. There were actually nine fluffy tails behind him.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! It's a nine-tailed fox! So cute!"</p>

    <p>"As expected of the president of our student union! Even the animals that turn into animals are different from others!"</p>

    <p>Many boys and girls were instantly attracted to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Normally, it would not turn into a legendary thing like a nine-tailed fox.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong still didn't want Wang Ling to receive too much attention, so he made his animal image look even more surprising.</p>

    <p>When everyone's eyes were focused on her, naturally no one would notice Wang Ling anymore.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>When the morning classes were all over, Sun Rong received another grateful toffee from Wang Ling in his pencil case.</p>

    <p>It's still the white rabbit.</p>

    <p>However, the packaging of this gratitude toffee is slightly different from the previous one.</p>

    <p>There is an extra line of small words on the packaging: "Double the sugar!"</p>

    <p>Thinking of the last time Wei Zhi's chest turned into an inflated air bag after eating toffee, Sun Rong couldn't help but blush.</p>

    <p>Ah this...</p>

    <p>If you want to eat this, it won't be more exaggerated!</p>

    <p>The last time Wei Zhi ate it was already very exaggerated!</p>

    <p>Put the candy away carefully. Sun Rong took the initiative to use a "cooling technique" to calm down.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was lunch time. Sun Rong was sitting at the desk in the student union office with his chin held high.</p>

    <p>All I can think about is Wang Ling's pair of bunny ears.</p>

    <p>She really wanted to... touch and see!</p>

    <p>"Ying'er?"Sun Rong shouted. She wanted to ask Sun Ying'er what her opinion was. But Sun Ying'er didn't reply to her.</p>

    <p>She found that Sun Ying'er, who had always been noisy, became extra honest today.</p>

    <p>There's not even a sound left!</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with you Ying'er. Why don't you speak? Is the Master of Shadows persecuting you again?" Sun Rong asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er obediently maintained the image of a shadow. She didn't even dare to show her human form. She mysteriously told Sun Rong: "It's none of that person's business! It's much scarier than him!"</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl, the master of Shadow, is lying on Wang Ling's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong although invisible.</p>

    <p>But she can definitely see it...</p>

    <p>Throughout the morning's class, Sun Ying'er felt like a pair of terrifying eyes were watching her from behind. The sight made her whole body tremble.</p>

    <p>I feel like my parents are watching me do my homework from behind.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that Wang Nuan would actually form a shadow and come to the school...</p>

    <p>And it seems that as of now, the brother and sister don't plan to tell anyone about this matter.</p>

    <p>So Sun Ying'er naturally didn't have the guts to reveal Wang Nuan's existence.</p>

    <p>"You're not normal... You're acting weird today." Sun Rong muttered.</p>

    <p>Of course, she didn't have free time to think about why Sun Ying'er was so obedient today. She was thinking about Wang Ling's bunny ears.</p>

    <p>"We are an old married couple. If you want to touch it, just go and touch it. Just do it." Sun Ying'er suggested quietly.</p>

    <p>"What an old couple... you're talking nonsense again."Sun Rong was said again and blushed.</p>

    <p>It's not like she hasn't thought about what would happen if she directly touched it...</p>

    <p>But in that case, she felt that it was disrespectful to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There is no difference from those uneducated girls!</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was extremely confused, there was a knock on the door of the Student Union Office.</p>

    <p>"Please come in." His thoughts quickly returned. Sun Rong said with his fingers crossed and his chin supported.</p>

    <p>A figure wearing a 60 High School uniform pushed open the door and walked in. What caught his eye was Sun Rong, a somewhat surprised person.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiugong Liangzi... why are you here?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't come here just to thank you!" Jiugong Liangzi crossed his arms and hummed.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>That's a bit obvious.It's a bit too obvious...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help laughing: "Then please sit down..."</p>

    <p>In fact, she felt that she was the one to thank.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong didn't help much with Jiugong's family matters. Most of them were done by Li Xian. And she only provided some bargaining chips for cooperation.</p>

    <p>This time she went abroad with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was the first time in Sun Rong's life that she and Wang Ling went out together. But she also learned a lot about love from Zhai Yin... And more importantly. She felt closer to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's not the untouchable feeling I had before.</p>

    <p>At least now Wang Ling can understand her feelings. I will thank her.</p>

    <p>When nothing happened, I put a toffee into her pencil case...</p>

    <p>Every time I think of this, Sun Rong can't help but raise the corners of my lips and smile.</p>

    <p>She feels that she is really a person who is easily satisfied.</p>

    <p>Now when Jiugong Liangzi came in, Sun Rong was also very polite and poured her a cup of hot tea himself.</p>

    <p>Normal people do not have the privilege of Sun Rong making tea in person.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is Sun Rong's inner gratitude.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was also because after she knew the current development progress of Jiugong Liangzi and Zhuo Yi, she fully understood that this one was completely without any threat.</p>

    <p>For example, before the first class in the morning, many girls ran to touch Wang Ling's bunny ears.</p>

    <p>Only Jiugong Liangzi lowered his head and read a book. He didn't care about such things at all.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi, what do you want from me?"Sun Rong put down the hot tea.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi took the tea cup and thought for a moment. Then he raised his head and looked at Sun Rong: "Do you have anything that you don't particularly dislike?"</p>

    <p>Something not particularly annoying...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thinks she should be asking about something she particularly likes...</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>Arrogant or something.</p>

    <p>Troublesome and cute.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior didn't tell you anything?" Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>"I'm just not sure. That's why I wanted to ask you in person!" Jiugong Liangzi snorted. Her cheeks were also red.</p>

    <p>As the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family, she has never knelt down to someone else's office to ask for their opinions before buying a gift.</p>

    <p>The result was something Jiugong Liangzi never expected.</p>

    <p>My first time.</p>

    <p>It was handed over to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Sun Rong is still the woman she has always regarded as her opponent!</p>

    <p>Obviously an opponent...</p>

    <p>The result was that they were facing each other. It was amazing that they suddenly had a united front.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi thinks this may be the "mysterious power from the East." In other words... it is a power unique to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is not big enough compared to Jiudaohe's current scale. The average level of students is not particularly high either. But it does feel like a big family.</p>

    <p>It seems like it can unite everyone closely.</p>

    <p>This point is actually well reflected in Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School just sent a delegation of exchange students. As a result, Jiudaohe High School, which had always had a clear hierarchy, was incorporated!</p>

    <p>So now Jiugong Liangzi has officially decided to settle in Huaxiu for a long time and complete his studies at Number 60 High School in the future.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Sun Rong congratulated you repeatedly: "Congratulations to you, classmate Jiugong. Zhuo Yi Senior, you must be very happy to know."</p>

    <p>"What's there to congratulate..." Jiugong Liangzi pouted. He said something incomprehensible, but in fact he couldn't deny what Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Because the reason why she stayed was that she didn't fully like the teaching style of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that she and Zhuo Yi have established a relationship...</p>

    <p>Long distance relationships are too hard.</p>

    <p>She hopes that she and Zhuo Yi can have a normal relationship.</p>

    <p>"I don't think I hate anything... It should be obvious. Classmates Liangzi are happy now. You see, I'm still alone." Sun Rong sighed and sat down next to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Only then did Jiugong Liangzi react: "Nani? Are you and your classmate Wang Ling not together yet..."</p>

    <p>"Who said I was with him?" Sun Rong's cheeks instantly turned red: "My classmate Wang Ling. is a piece of wood..."</p>

    <p>"Ah. I'm sorry. I thought you had a showdown after you went abroad together. Unexpectedly, it hasn't been settled yet." Jiugong Liangzi was surprised.</p>

    <p>It's not like she hasn't heard Zhuo Yi mention the story between Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi had hinted to her before that she could assist her.</p>

    <p>Now that he was talking about it, Jiugong Liangzi felt that he suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>"That's it." At this time, Jiugong Liangzi held his chin up and showed a strategist attitude: "As long as I help you catch up with classmate Wang Ling, the debt of gratitude between us can be canceled in one go, right?"</p>

    <p>"Uh... eh..."Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>She actually didn't expect that Jiugong Liangzi, a tsundere, was very roundabout when he was going to be direct. He was also very direct when he was direct.</p>

    <p>"This guy is not easy to deal with."</p>

    <p>Very quickly. Drawing on his years of experience in "seeing a lot of men," Jiugong Liangzi defines the relationship between Sun Rong and Wang Ling. Jiugong Liangzi defines the relationship between Sun Rong and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She said: "Although it is a girl chasing a boy, my classmate Wang Ling's character is too abstinent. There may not be any results if this kind of pursuit continues."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Although this was not the first time she heard someone analyze this matter, she still felt a little tired.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to be so disappointed." Jiugong Liangzi quickly comforted him: "Then... what do you want me to do? I can cooperate with you! Of course. Let's make it clear first! I'm just returning a favor! No. Because I have changed my view on you. I want to unite the front with you..."</p>

    <p>"I know." Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she thought of Wang Ling's pair of drooping rabbit ears again in her mind. She felt itchy in her heart.</p>

    <p>"Um... Classmate Liangzi... I want to ask you what you can do..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl stretched out her two index fingers, curled them together and touched them lightly. She was shy and confused: "I want to ask you. Is there any more natural way..."</p>

    <p>"What can be done?"</p>

    <p>"Just... the rabbit ears of Wang Ling! I want to touch them!"</p>

    <p>"Want to touch the ears." Jiugong Liangzi understood.</p>

    <p>After all, she's a girl who's in love. There's nothing special about wanting to touch a rabbit's ear.</p>

    <p>"Um..."</p>

    <p>"Is it okay to eat ears?"</p>

    <p>"ah?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that these grown animal parts don't have pain-sensing nerves. If that doesn't work, I'll find someone to cut off the rabbit ears and give them to you. Then I'll make spicy rabbit ears!"</p>

    <p>"How can this be done! Rabbits are so cute... how can they be eaten!"</p>

    <p>"I was joking. I didn't expect you to be so serious..." Jiugong Liangzi laughed.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>At first she thought that Sun Rong's relationship with Wang Ling was just for fun. But now she realizes that she really likes her.</p>

    <p>If you don't really like someone, how can you think about so many things...</p>

    <p>And those uncultured girls who just go up and touch their ears in the morning. This is the true sign of liking someone.</p>

    <p>Everything you say and do is not to satisfy your own selfish desires. Instead, you consider the people you like wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi actually doesn't understand it very well.</p>

    <p>What's so good about Wang Ling? You can be obsessed with Sun Rong like this.</p>

    <p>It was almost time for school to end. At Jiugong Liangzi's suggestion, Jiugong Liangzi rode on Sun Rong's shoulders. The two of them wore a huge cloak. They looked like they were walking alone.</p>

    <p>The hand under the cloak is the hand of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sitting above, Jiugong Liangzi is wearing a Jason mask. From a distance, he looks like an unusually tall man.</p>

    <p>The two women were heavily armed and covered themselves up extremely well. They were standing by the roadside waiting for Wang Ling to pass by.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong doesn't think this cover-up is effective for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>With the boy's eyesight, he can definitely tell... there must be two of them inside the cloak!</p>

    <p>But at the moment Jiugong Liangzi doesn't know the true strength of Wang Ling. That's why he thinks this method is effective.</p>

    <p>"Is it really okay... Classmate Liangzi..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Leave the talking to me. When the time comes, all you have to do is take your hands out from under the cloak and touch them." Jiugong Liangzi was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>Under the cloak. Sun Rong held her forehead. She suddenly felt a little regretful.</p>

    <p>In the case of information asymmetry, she should not have rashly approached Jiugong Liangzi to participate in the operation.</p>

    <p>"It's coming, it's coming. Pay attention!" At this time, Jiugong Liangzi coughed slightly, indicating that Sun RongWang Ling was about to pass by.</p>

    <p>It was the first time Jiugong Liangzi rode on Sun Rong's shoulders in this position.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiugong Liangzi also regrets why he came up with such an idea.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I didn't think about it before implementing it. After doing it, Jiugong really wanted to slap himself to death...</p>

    <p>Because when she was riding on Sun Rong's shoulder, her calf just touched the girl's soft part.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>She is obviously four years younger than her! Why is she growing so well?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was heartbroken.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong is not too outrageous at the moment, it is obvious that there is huge room for development and growth! He is only 16 years old and has such a scale! If he were a little older, it would be great!</p>

    <p>If you grow up to the age of a married woman... I'm afraid it will be even more terrifying!</p>

    <p>"Hello classmate!" When he saw Wang Ling passing in front of him, Jiugong Liangzi used his voice changing spell to stop Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling paused. Wang Nuan and Wang Nuan looked at Jiugong Liangzi wearing a Jason mask and Sun Rong who was covered by a cloak under Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>"Classmate... we are conducting a blessing activity! As long as you touch the top of your head for us, you can get a pack of snacks." Jiugong Liangzi, wearing a Jason mask, made a rough voice.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong under the cloak also cooperated very well and took out a package of golden limited edition crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>This is a winter limited edition.</p>

    <p>It's sweet ice flavored crispy noodles! The whole package of crispy noodles is sweet! It's different from the previous versions with pepper noodles!</p>

    <p>Looking at the previous scene, Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>This package of crispy noodles is indeed limited.</p>

    <p>But in fact Wang Ling has already eaten it.</p>

    <p>There was no confusion in his heart, not even much surprise. On the contrary, Ah Nuan on his shoulder bit his finger and made an expression as if he wanted to eat.</p>

    <p>"Want to eat?"Wang Ling poked Ah Nuan's tender face.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling walked towards Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong who were hiding themselves in cloaks without saying a word.</p>

    <p>When the boy's familiar breath approached, Sun Rong could clearly feel his own heartbeat that was about to come out.</p>

    <p>Bang bang bang bang...</p>

    <p>She never thought that she would be so nervous.</p>

    <p>Then, in front of Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong, Wang Ling half-bent down and exposed his head.</p>

    <p>The girl's face was red and she slowly reached out. Wang Ling recognized it as Sun Rong's hand at a glance. She was trembling nervously. Her fingers were trembling...</p>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling sighed silently.</p>

    <p>He took another step forward and took the initiative to move his head up.</p>

    <p>"Ya!"</p>

    <p>"I touched it!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong screamed out excitedly.</p>

    <p>The moment the fingertips touched the rabbit ears, a huge steam shot out from under the cloak...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was shocked.</p>

    <p>She was riding on Sun Rong's shoulders. Suddenly she felt a huge propulsive force underneath her body.</p>

    <p>When she reacted again.</p>

    <p>The powerful driving force generated by the terrifying Steam Girl beneath her has already taken the two of them a dozen meters above the ground...</p>
