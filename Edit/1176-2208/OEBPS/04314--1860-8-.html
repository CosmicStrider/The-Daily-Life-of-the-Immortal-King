  <h1>Chapter 1860 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This question was more like a code handover signal from an intelligence agent in a spy movie. All of a sudden, the three people present except Emperor Dongda raised their heads.</p>

    <p>The three people looked at each other. Although they did not speak, the "Team Communication Technique" had already been activated.</p>

    <p>"No way... it can't be such a coincidence..." Wang Zhen winked at Zhang Zhui in the dark.</p>

    <p>"Calm down." Zhang Zhui tilted his head and persuaded.</p>

    <p>At the same time, there was an expression of disbelief on his face: "Maybe this is sympathy between the strong and the strong. Maybe they share a special hobby. It doesn't necessarily mean that this is Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>"So there really were crispy noodles in ancient times?" Sun Rong was curious.</p>

    <p>"This... I don't know." Zhang Zhui blushed.</p>

    <p>He had no interest in snacks. Although he claimed to have stolen everything before, he was only limited to relatively valuable items.</p>

    <p>However, Zhang Zhui still has doubts about whether the Dongda in front of him is Wang Ling. "But the problem is. Ling Zhenren is not that talkative. So whether the Dongda is Ling Zhenren or not, I think we should be more cautious."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong lowered her head and thought for a while. Then she replied: "Senior Zhang is absolutely right. Classmate Wang Ling is indeed not that talkative. Master of Shadows is not necessarily the case. If classmate Wang Ling and the Master of Shadows are both in the body of Emperor Dongdai... The person who spoke is most likely the Master of Shadows."</p>

    <p>"Another possibility is that classmate Wang Ling is so awesome. I think he must have entered this world constructed by mysterious texts on his own, instead of being passively sucked in like us."</p>

    <p>"So if classmate Wang Ling takes the initiative to enter the world, then he may take the initiative to assume the identity of Emperor Dongda. This also means that the body used by classmate Wang Ling also has the consciousness of Emperor Dongda himself."</p>

    <p>The series of strong analysis was clear and logical. From the logical rationality point of view, there were almost no loopholes. Zhang Zhui was stunned when he heard it.</p>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <p>After eliminating all possibilities, the remaining situation is no longer possible. That is the only answer.</p>

    <p>"Awesome Rongrong. Qingyi has always praised you for being smart." After hearing this analysis, the expression on Wang Zhen's face was particularly surprised.</p>

    <p>The three of them were secretly having a heated discussion on "Team Communication Technique." Should they go further and verify the identity of the suspected Wang Ling Emperor Dongda?</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came over.</p>

    <p>"Haha. So it's you guys. I thought you were a little weird..."</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ying's voice.</p>

    <p>The three of them did not expect that the team's sound transmission technique was directly monitored by Wang Ling and Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"It's really you, Master of Shadows! That classmate Wang Ling..." Hearing a familiar voice, Sun Rong was immediately surprised.</p>

    <p>"He is here too. Emperor Dongda was not always looking at you before. In fact, it was the Lord who was looking at you."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Is he looking at me?"</p>

    <p>"It seems that your sitting posture looks a little familiar. Compared to the original appearance of the Sun Goddess, your sitting posture is too cute."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Sun Rong's face turned slightly red.</p>

    <p>She felt a little happy.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Besides me and the Lord, there is another person. But this person doesn't know the Lord. It's me who has been delivering messages on the Lord's behalf in this body. Do you understand what I mean?"</p>

    <p>"Got it."</p>

    <p>The three nodded immediately.</p>

    <p>At this moment, they suddenly heard the rich and magnetic voice of a strange man: "Have you finished recognizing the masters... Next, I have business to do. Since the masters came in with their upper body, Yes. Then please ask the great gods to cooperate with us in carrying out this drama."</p>

    <p>This is the voice of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>At this time, Dongda also joined the team voice.</p>

    <p>But it was Wang Ling who took the initiative to bring him in.</p>

    <p>In conjunction with Wang Ying's explanation to Emperor Dongda before Wang Ling came in, Emperor Dongda immediately knew what had happened.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Everything was just as Sun Rong guessed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying entered the body of Dongda at the same time. And Dongda himself also has his own thinking consciousness.</p>

    <p>"Now that Emperor Dongda is here, it will be easy to handle. I wonder if I can ask Emperor Dongda how we should get out." Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>Within the team voice technique. Zhang Zhui's voice is his original voice.</p>

    <p>As soon as he opened his mouth, Dongda frowned: "I know you. You are Zhang Zhui."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was shocked: "Emperor Dongda actually knows that I am here?"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "I didn't expect that you could actually survive to the world of cultivation after eternity. This is indeed a bit beyond my expectation. Those concubines in my harem, you must have stolen a lot."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhang Zhui sweated: "You actually know..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Zhen, Sun Rong;"..."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "I am the Emperor. Of course I know."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "But you seem to have never traced me..."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "Why do we need to track you down? I have to thank you instead. You have relieved a lot of my burden."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Dongda: "Forget it. Let's not mention this. You just asked how to get out. In fact, it is very simple to leave the world of my diary. Just cooperate with me to complete the next script."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior. But the problem is that we are not the only ones trapped in this world. We have other companions who have not been found."</p>

    <p>"This is even simpler. Since you have entered my diary, you are playing the characters written in my diary. And any character who has appeared is not a minor character."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda replied: "There will be a gathering of the four emperors in the next two days tomorrow. All important figures from the four regions will be there. You should be able to take this opportunity to find your friends."</p>

    <p>"This is the last performance. As soon as the performance is over, it will end. You can return to modern times. It will not have any impact on your lives."</p>

    <p>"As for the person behind the scenes who planned all this, I have already explained everything that needs to be said to Master Wang Ying. There is no hiding anything. In short, this senior person behind the scenes is not simple. He is a character that even our emperor cannot control. This person is not Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui frowned: "There are not many people who can do such a thing. It seems that there is only Dao Ancestor Wang. But you said it is not Dao Ancestor Wang. In the eternal time, is there anyone who can compare with Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>"There is a world outside the sky. Even with my current vision, I am not sure that it is not possible at all." Emperor Dongda said this. His brows jumped: "Since Zhang Zhui, you are also an Eternal One, then it should be very clear. Before us, the Eternal One, this The overlords of the universe are not cultivators like us from the old age... Maybe they are not extinct yet. And they are staring at us in the darkness of the abyss."</p>
