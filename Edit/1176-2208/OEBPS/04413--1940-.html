  <h1>Chapter 1940 Teng Luchen's preparations</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has been covering up for so long. Now, for the first time, a sense of crisis is welling up in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that Teng Luchen was very dangerous. More dangerous than anyone he had ever met before. Not only that, he even felt that he had exposed something on the spot this time in order to rescue Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This Mr. Teng is not that easy to fool...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>After seeing Mr. Teng leave, he immediately entered the core group of the Office of Strategic Deception and started reporting: "Old Mr. Teng has left. But I intuitively thought that he would not give up the investigation of the master so easily."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was particularly concerned about this matter. She replied almost immediately: "I just asked Grandpa. His knowledge about Teng Lao is very limited. But what can be confirmed is that the relationship between Teng Lao and Emperor is very different.</p>

    <p>"After all, he is a character from that era. It's normal."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said: "Everyone should continue to be vigilant. If Brother Ling is not careful this time, I'm afraid he will be exposed."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Of course. I will think of a solution later. Let's see how we can suppress this matter. Having said that, I have to thank classmate Fang Xing this time (*￣︶￣)"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Whatever you say, it's all my job. It's Wang Ling's business. That's my business."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this point in the chat, although on the surface the atmosphere in the group was harmonious, privately everyone was sweating.</p>

    <p>Although this time the sudden action of the Office of Strategic Deception was barely managed, it was actually just as Zhuo Yi thought.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because their actions this time were too abrupt. In the eyes of the old man, this would become a way of covering up.</p>

    <p>When Teng Luchen returned to Jiutian Tea House, Jing Heqiu had already used {Creation Technique} and {Dou Zhuan Star Shifting Array} to repair the previously destroyed parts of the place.</p>

    <p>The Jiutian Teahouse is an important location. There are usually backups of the same building materials. When it is damaged, the teahouse can be easily repaired through magic.</p>

    <p>At this time, the door of the teahouse was closed tightly. Jing Heqiu bowed to Teng Luchen, who looked not very good-looking, and said, "Old Teng, the first batch of tests happened because of an accident. All students who have not been tested have been arranged for follow-up supplementary tests."</p>

    <p>"The students who have entered the spirit world have also successfully passed the internal test and returned from the spirit world."</p>

    <p>"But, looking at Old Teng, it seems that he hasn't found the answer he wants?"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen sat on the wooden bench. His eyebrows were furrowed. After thinking for a long time, he looked at Jing Heqiu and said slowly: "This time the Office of Strategic Deception suddenly came to help. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"I feel that it's very sudden. I feel like they're hiding something." Jing Heqiu answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teng Luchen suddenly laughed: "It's not bad. You have finally made some progress. This operation of the Office of Strategic Deception has just exposed the fact that they are trying to hide. It's just what they are trying to hide. I still lack evidence at the moment."</p>

    <p>"So. Mr. Teng still doubts that classmate Wang?"</p>

    <p>"What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"I think he is just ordinary... nothing extraordinary about him. Even when he entered the spiritual world this time, he was influenced by that Li Changzhe."</p>

    <p>"Did you see clearly? The primer he used was stuck on Li Changzhe's body?"</p>

    <p>"You can see it clearly. There is absolutely no mistake."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said: "And Mr. Teng doesn't think it's a bit unrealistic for the Office of Strategic Deception to launch such a large-scale operation to protect such a high school student..."</p>

    <p>"You are right. This is in line with the logic of normal people's thinking."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen smiled. He paused. He wanted to say: Sometimes, things are not what you see.</p>

    <p>But in the end, he still couldn't speak.</p>

    <p>However, Teng Luchen still firmly believed that his judgment was correct.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is the young man he has been looking for.</p>

    <p>But now, he still lacks key evidence.</p>

    <p>This time the trial of the spiritual world internal beta is actually a "double-edged sword."</p>

    <p>On the way back to Jiutian Teahouse, Teng Luchen had already made the assumption of reverse reasoning.</p>

    <p>If we assume that this operation of the Office of Strategic Deception is really to cover up Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then the Office of Strategic Deception must already know all the plans on his side. They are here for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In other words, the actions taken by the Office of Strategic Deception this time seem to have alerted the enemy. They were too aggressive.</p>

    <p>And his actions were also exposed in broad daylight during this temptation.</p>

    <p>But Teng Luchen was not panicked at all, because he exposed his true intentions through this internal test in the spirit world. This was also part of his calculation...</p>

    <p>"Have you obtained the recording of the internal beta test in the spirit world?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet. But I have protected the data inside the server. I will copy and transfer it to myself later to make sure the data is safe."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. Well done."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen nodded: "You must remember. This matter can only be reported directly to me. There is no need to go through anyone else. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Mr. Teng."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu nodded: "It's just that I don't know something. I don't know whether to talk about it or not."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen: "You want to ask me why you are so persistent about this Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu nodded: "Yes."</p>

    <p>He really didn't understand.</p>

    <p>As Teng Luchen, why would you waste so much precious time on such an ordinary high school student?</p>

    <p>Not to mention the ability to identify talents. Jing Heqiu thinks that he still has some.</p>

    <p>His realm is not low either. Following Teng Luchen over the years, he has seen many geniuses of all kinds. But he can be sure. Wang Ling is definitely not the person he or Teng Luchen are looking for.</p>

    <p>A monk who only knows how to consume puffed food will not be of any benefit to his practice.</p>

    <p>"I still need some time to verify this issue. When the time is right, I will tell you naturally." Teng Luchen gave up and said, "I have never made a mistake in all these years."</p>

    <p>"I hope so."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said.</p>

    <p>Before he left Jiutian Teahouse, he still had doubts.</p>

    <p>And after sending Jing Heqiu away.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen also started his next plan.</p>

    <p>Previously, he speculated that this temptation in the spiritual world was a double-edged sword-like two-way exposure.</p>

    <p>And his intention to deliberately expose and test Wang Ling was also within the scope of the plan.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, this is definitely not something Teng Luchen said casually.</p>

    <p>Just as Jing Heqiu left, he came to the tea shelf in the teahouse. Inside, there were small jars of tea filled with the fragrance of tea. They were all handpicked works by masters.</p>

    <p>He touched one of the hexagonal ceramic tea pots and changed the angle of the tea pot.</p>

    <p>Then, the tea stand suddenly made a buzzing sound.</p>

    <p>Just behind the tea can, a wall covered with photos and memo stickers appeared.</p>

    <p>These are all intelligence materials collected by Teng Luchen over the years.</p>

    <p>Piles of pieces. All closely related to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>At this time, Teng Luchen personally filled in the latest information.</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception has initially suspected me of trying to expose Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"What if I lose my memory later."</p>

    <p>"That proves all the doubts written on this wall. They are all correct answers."</p>

    <p>"This note was written by Teng Luchen at 3:48 am on January 15, 4397..."</p>
