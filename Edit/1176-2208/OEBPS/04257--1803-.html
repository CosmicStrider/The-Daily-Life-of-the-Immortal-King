  <h1>Chapter 1803 Oh ho. It's over!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Why...why I've always been alone..."</p>

    <p>"Why do you all have someone you like...even Zhai could find his girlfriend in the end...but I didn't..."</p>

    <p>"Why do you have a young lady with such a nice voice to play games with you...and help you win..."</p>

    <p>"Why do I have nothing... In the end I can only get into this old man's body..."</p>

    <p>The envious ghost's grudge was so strong that after possessing the body of the Arch Pope, it immediately generated a strong spiritual pressure. Pei Luoqi was in a bad way, but at this moment he could only protect his wife and share this spiritual pressure for her who was frightened.</p>

    <p>Once he moves, it is easy to create a loophole, allowing the wife to directly experience the positive pressure from the jealous ghost.</p>

    <p>However, if he keeps guarding his wife, his son Pei Xiaoyuan will also face great danger.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>Therefore, he did not hesitate. Holding the Heavenly Dao gun, a golden bullet hit the Arch Pope on the head accurately.</p>

    <p>This is a Hunyuan bullet mixed with immortal energy and spiritual energy. It is extremely powerful!</p>

    <p>In Pei Luoqi's expected result, this bullet was enough to shoot through the jealous man's head. But at the same time, the explosive destructive power brought by the bullet would also destroy his house!</p>

    <p>And his son Pei Xiaoyuan will also be harmed. However, in order to save both of them at the same time, Pei Luoqi has no choice.</p>

    <p>However, what Pei Luoqi didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>This golden bullet actually failed to penetrate the head of the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>Instead, it was blocked by a condensed black resentment at the back of the head!</p>

    <p>The powerful power of resentment surrounds the Arch Pope's body. It exudes a green and black body-protecting light. It is like a copper wall and an iron wall that tightly wraps the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>"Leave me alone! Go and save your son!" his wife urged, trying hard to shake Pei Luoqi's arm. However, it was too late.</p>

    <p>"How could..." Pei Luoqi was stunned.</p>

    <p>Facing his wife's urging, his mind went blank and he felt powerless.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this time, the Arch Pope, who was possessed by the jealous ghost, punched through the wall and appeared directly in front of Pei Xiaoyuan next door. His face was extremely ferocious, and his pupils were emitting a faint green light.</p>

    <p>Pei Xiaoyuan was immediately frightened. He was frozen in place and did not dare to move at all.</p>

    <p>Such a sense of oppression is beyond the tolerance of a child.</p>

    <p>"Run!" Pei Luoqi looked anxious.</p>

    <p>He roared loudly.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Arch Pope stuck out his long tongue and was about to tie up Pei Xiaoyuan and lick him.</p>

    <p>However, the next second...</p>

    <p>A golden holy light suddenly came.</p>

    <p>The reward of this holy light was too sudden. It suddenly exploded from Pei Xiaoyuan's desk. Then the dazzling light immediately covered the entire room.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi couldn't see clearly what was happening.</p>

    <p>Only a loud buzzing sound was heard. When they came back to their senses, the light of the holy light had faded. They were left lying on the ground with their eyes rolled back. The Arch Pope was smoking...</p>

    <p>What on earth is going on?</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi was surprised.</p>

    <p>The jealous ghost possessing the Arch Pope was so powerful! Even his Heavenly Dao gun! It couldn't penetrate the world-level magic weapon! As a result, the crisis was resolved by a sudden ray of holy light...</p>

    <p>So what exactly is this?</p>

    <p>Thinking back to the time when the holy light was on, Pei Luoqi clearly remembered that at the moment when the holy light shone, his eyes were unable to penetrate the holy light and see other things.</p>

    <p>He is in Venerated Immortal status...</p>

    <p>A holy light that even he couldn't see clearly appeared in his home, and his child was saved.</p>

    <p>"It's the Holy Mother who has appeared!" Pei Luoqi's wife shouted excitedly. Because she was too frightened, her legs were still weak at this time, so she crawled to Pei Xiaoyuan.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoyuan? Xiaoyuan? Are you okay..." She hugged Pei Xiaoyuan tightly, who was also frightened and turned pale. The mother and son huddled in the corner and did not speak for a long time.</p>

    <p>After all, Pei Luoqi was the first to react. He calmed down and walked towards the high pope who rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>After confirming that the Arch Pope had no vital signs, Pei Luoqi also frowned tightly: "It's not easy to handle now. The Arch Pope is dead..."</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope...is dead?"</p>

    <p>His wife was stunned immediately.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi sighed: "Let's assume that the holy light just now was the apparition of the Holy Mother. But the Arch Pope died in our house... If this matter is revealed, I am afraid it will directly affect the relationship between our Heavenly Dao Alliance and the Arch Pope... And. The Arch Pope himself is also a Eight-Star Tengu. We are afraid that we will offend more forces than just the church..."</p>

    <p>"Let's move!" his wife whispered.</p>

    <p>"There's no point in moving."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi shook his head: "With the Tengu's intelligence network, even if we move, they will know our location. What's more, acting rashly now will only arouse suspicion." He sighed.</p>

    <p>Outside. He is the leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao League.</p>

    <p>But when he returns home, he is the head of the family who protects this small world.</p>

    <p>Facing his wife and children, Pei Luoqi now has no choice.</p>

    <p>He squatted half-crouched, hugged his wife and son Pei Xiaoyuan, and comforted him: "Next, our family will have to overcome the difficulties together... I hope that you can trust me unconditionally. This is a hurdle. We have to go through it now." We must step forward..."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now?" Pei Luoqi's wife asked.</p>

    <p>"Next, I want you to find a way to clean up the house. Don't leave any clues or evidence. At the same time, don't tell anyone that the Arch Pope came to our house."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi said bitterly. Then he looked at the body of the Arch Pope on the ground: "As for the body of the Arch Pope, I will take care of it. Now, I not only want to put aside the relationship between our family and the Arch Pope. Let's also leave aside the relationship between the Heavenly Dao Alliance and the church in this matter..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For Pei Luoqi, this was a huge accident. Everything seemed to happen suddenly.</p>

    <p>The death of the Arch Pope was a bombshell.</p>

    <p>If this matter leaks out, it will have a huge impact.</p>

    <p>And if outsiders were to know that the Arch Pope eventually died in his home, all Pei Luoqi's explanations would be in vain.</p>

    <p>Even if we can find evidence of that jealous ghost.</p>

    <p>And proved that the Arch Pope was trying to protect his family but was possessed by a jealous ghost...</p>

    <p>But he couldn't explain what that holy light was.</p>

    <p>So now there is only one path before Pei Luoqi.</p>

    <p>That is to do everything possible to distance himself from the relationship with the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>And to cover...</p>

    <p>He must find a reasonable scapegoat.</p>

    <p>As the leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao Alliance, he originally came here to mediate conflicts.</p>

    <p>But now, he had to use his identity to create a new truth about the death of the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>Think about it.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi felt that there was no other way.</p>

    <p>He felt that in the current situation, it was best to let Maiko Assi take the blame...</p>
