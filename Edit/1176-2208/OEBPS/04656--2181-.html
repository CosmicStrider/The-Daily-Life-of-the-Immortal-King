  <h1>Chapter 2181 The double game between reality and illusionâ‘¡</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! This long-planned bullet traveled across countless light years to arrive here. It was beyond everyone's expectation. The golden bullet case was adjusted by Wang Ling's first-step rule. Pass through the layers of space and successfully reach Wang Muyu's core world.</p>

    <p>This is an impossible operation in the eyes of any monk. Wang Ling needs to obtain the law key of Wang Muyu's core world without harming Wang Muyu. Then condense the law key into an inscription and bless it on the bullet.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when the golden bullet arrived at the corresponding area, the inscription on the bullet was equivalent to the key. It entered Wang Muyu's core world without any effort, causing this unexpected blow.</p>

    <p>The mighty golden law and order buried the clone body and the corpse dragon below. No one could have imagined that two masters who had reached the ancestral realm would be buried on the spot. And there was no chance of fighting back.</p>

    <p>These golden laws entangled them, making them feel like they were trapped in a quagmire, sinking deeper and deeper.</p>

    <p>"Fly! Fly!"</p>

    <p>Both the clone body and the corpse dragon were neighing and roaring. They tried their best to resist, trying to break free from the pouring golden sea of law.</p>

    <p>But the legal pouring effect brought by this golden bullet is too targeted. When Wang Ling planned this bullet, he had even calculated the positions of several people.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this sea of laws only takes effect between the body and the corpse dragon. On the contrary, Wang Muyu and Yi Jianchuan are in a relatively safe location, overlooking the two people who are being submerged.</p>

    <p>They struggled in pain. But it was not over yet.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next second, the golden bullet hit the sea of laws. In an instant, the core world shook. The sea of laws was burning violently.</p>

    <p>This scene is too amazing. It's like a large firework and firecracker exploding here. Immortal energy fluctuations are connected in an instant. It's like the stars in the sky collide at this moment.</p>

    <p>The clone body and the corpse dragon were already struggling to break free from this sea of laws. They were firmly restricted in the sea of laws. In addition, the sea of laws exploded.</p>

    <p>To sum it up in one sentence -</p>

    <p>They were blown to pieces!</p>

    <p>In a short moment, the whole body felt like being punched by a trillion tons. It was being beaten by explosions all the time. Although it was not in the universe, it was better than being in it. The two people were blown up and were completely messed up. Here Pieces are floating up and down in the sea.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan put his hands behind his back and watched this scene. It was also messy in the wind.</p>

    <p>Two ancestral realms...</p>

    <p>In this sea of laws, they are like two dogs about to be drowned. It is really miserable. They float up and down. Sometimes they jump out of the sea, sometimes they are submerged by the laws and sink to the bottom of the sea. They also spit out all kinds of things they accidentally drank in their mouths. Golden Rule.</p>

    <p>These golden laws are inherently burning and exploding. Therefore, they not only have to withstand the explosion outside the body, but also the explosion and surge inside the body at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Muyu...what is this golden bullet?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan was shocked.</p>

    <p>He only saw a golden bullet coming towards him. Then he directly turned the situation around. Who shot this bullet... made Yi Jianchuan very curious.</p>

    <p>Even the top gunner in the modern world of cultivation may not be able to achieve such an effect if he tries his best to fire this bullet.</p>

    <p>Therefore, what Yi Jianchuan guessed in his mind was that this person must have come from Eternal. Unless he was a powerful Eternal One, how could he possibly turn two ancestral realms into a drowned dog...</p>

    <p>"It's a brother I know. He didn't graduate from college." Wang Muyu replied directly.</p>

    <p>He didn't tell Xiang Yi directly. But he still revealed his identity. Yi Jianchuan broke into cold sweat after hearing it.</p>

    <p>College students who have not graduated...</p>

    <p>Is this still a normal human being?</p>

    <p>The sea of laws. The artistic atmosphere of the explosion covered the entire sea area. The seven-color mountains belonging to Wang Muyu's core world were shattered together with the sea of laws. They exploded into gorgeous seven-color whirlpools. From a distance, they looked like the painter Fan Gao's masterpiece.</p>

    <p>The colors are rich and full of artistic sense. Take a random photo and use it as a screen saver. No one can imagine that this explosion is still going off. The explosions are shocking. It pushes the fighting in the entire core world to a climax.</p>

    <p>On the ferry in the restricted sea area, Qiao Yanyuan was sweating profusely. He was caught in a dilemma for a while.</p>

    <p>Before seeing this golden bullet, he immediately realized how extraordinary this bullet was. He wanted to directly switch to his clone body and rush to the front line to resolve this battle.</p>

    <p>However, after seeing the power of the continuous explosion of this golden sea of laws, he fell silent.</p>

    <p>Because it looks painful...</p>

    <p>The clone body and the corpse dragon had been knocked unconscious. Even if his stronger body passed by, Qiao Yanyuan was not sure whether he could withstand the blow.</p>

    <p>If the clone body is released directly, it means that the damaged body of the clone body will be synchronized with one's own soul at the moment the clone body is released. The self as the main body will also share part of the pain.</p>

    <p>This is also what Qiao Yanyuan doesn't want to see.</p>

    <p>So right now, it seems that there is only one way. That is to directly terminate the clone contract with this real clone and let him fend for himself...</p>

    <p>But doing this will directly affect his cultivation.</p>

    <p>In other words, Qiao Yanyuan now has two choices.</p>

    <p>Either endure the physical pain. Or endure the pain of losing your cultivation.</p>

    <p>All in all, it's just pain and that's it...</p>

    <p>Other than that, he has no other choice.</p>

    <p>Over there at the Office of Strategic Deception. Are there still experts out there...</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was stunned.</p>

    <p>He thought that the investigation into the Office of Strategic Deception had been thorough. But he didn't expect that this sudden golden bullet would turn the entire situation around...</p>

    <p>It's obvious that the strongest boy on earth is restricted in the game world. It seems that Wang Muyu is already helpless. No existing monk on earth may not be able to help him. Even that man's sister steps in. So With Qiao Yanyuan's current combat power, he was also confident that he could snatch Wang Muyu away while resisting the little girl.</p>

    <p>But something like this happened right now. Qiao Yanyuan's plan to snatch Wang Muyu came to a deadlock.</p>

    <p>Damn...it's so unforgivable...</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was extremely unwilling.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe had just given him the title Purple Sun Dragon Lord. This was a symbol of nobility among the dragonborn. It proved that his status had been promoted to a first-line general by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>But he, a front-line general, had a bad start. The first mission ended in failure.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was very angry. But there was nothing he could do.</p>

    <p>The explosion of this golden sea of laws still hasn't stopped.</p>

    <p>It seems that his clone and the corpse dragon will never come back. No ancestral realm can withstand such a continuous explosion that can be called a star bomb...</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan gritted his teeth. He had no choice but to summon the clone contract and cut the contract directly.</p>

    <p>This move is to cut off the tail of the gecko. But it is a helpless move.</p>

    <p>I can only think of other ways to make amends.</p>
