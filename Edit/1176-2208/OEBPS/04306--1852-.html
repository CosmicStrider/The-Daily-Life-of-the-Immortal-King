  <h1>Chapter 1852 Whose call?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Nine Dragon Vermillion Bird. The huge nine dragon heads are deeply rooted in the earth. They are like pillars from the sky. They wantonly plunder the destiny of the empire and the underground spiritual veins.</p>

    <p>A steady stream of energy is absorbed by the Sun Goddess, causing the energy density of her petite body to continue to increase.</p>

    <p>Everyone present felt the strong danger. There is no doubt that this is a method of common death.</p>

    <p>"This woman is crazy..." The surviving royals from the Western Regions were all stunned. However, they were unable to escape at this time. Because their bodies were injured, they could not escape far even if they escaped now.</p>

    <p>Once the body of the Sun Goddess explodes, the impact will cover the entire eastern region of the universe, not just the land under their feet. Within this range, all planets will be destroyed.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda's expression gradually became indifferent under the pressure of the Sun Goddess. He took action against the same source. The situation of fratricide was not what he wanted to see.</p>

    <p>However, if you are on the throne of the emperor, you must do what you should do as an emperor.</p>

    <p>He has no fear at all. He is protected by the supreme light Kongque Dharma, which gives him enough confidence to deal with the current situation.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the Eastern Emperor was not angry and proud. He had a kind of majesty as an emperor. He ignored the pressure of the Kowloon encroachment and stood proudly in the sky. His movements were in harmony with the heaven and the earth.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In an instant, a strong light emerged from his body. It was endless light. It radiated from his body. It emanated from the Supreme King Kongque's Dharma. It was endless.</p>

    <p>"It's the Emperor's secret power!" Everyone present looked surprised.</p>

    <p>The Eastern Emperor is using such power at this time to compete with the Sun Goddess for the destiny and spiritual power of the empire under his feet. Because of his identity as the emperor, and under the situation of operating the Emperor's secret power, there is no need for the complicated things like the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>He is the master of the Eastern Region. As long as he stands there, he can have an impact, forming a kind of long-range competition.</p>

    <p>If we use modern words to make an analogy, the Sun Goddess is like plugging in a network cable. And the Eastern Emperor is connected...the two are competing for network speed together.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined it. The speed of Dongda's long-distance competition was astonishing. He stood proudly in the sky and snatched food from the dragon's mouth. It was as if he was commanding the entire world.</p>

    <p>"Chichichichi..."</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the sound of countless feathers falling.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Light Kongque Mingwang Fa Tong launched a counterattack at the same time. While helping Emperor Dongda in the fight, he inserted Yu Ling into the backbone of Jiulong.</p>

    <p>Underground, Kowloon let out a painful roar, and a huge earthquake formed on the spot.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda seized the gap, made fist seals with his hands, and stepped on the light. He aimed at the Sun Goddess and punched her away.</p>

    <p>A blazing ray of light burst out from his fist seal. It penetrated through eternity and hit the body of the Sun Goddess. It knocked the Sun Goddess away at once.</p>

    <p>The power of the punch without any hesitation was so heavy that it was unimaginable. The Goddess of the Sun never expected that the Eastern Emperor was fighting so hard with her for the fate of the empire and his spiritual veins. She could actually be distracted and attack him.</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked.</p>

    <p>Everyone felt that they had underestimated the power of the Supreme Light Kongque Ming King after all.</p>

    <p>People from the eastern and western regions had forgotten each other at this time. They were discussing the battle situation below. Everyone looked confused.</p>

    <p>"This Dharma is so unbelievable...it overwhelms the Nine Dragons and Suzakus. Even if the Sun Goddess swallows the Western Emperor's secret medicine to upgrade it, it will be useless! This King Kongque, the Supreme Light, is invincible!"</p>

    <p>"It's really strange. Why did Emperor Dongda's appearance suddenly upgrade...and this was without swallowing the secret medicine? Could it be that he really invited a god to take over?"</p>

    <p>"Where does the god come from...above the emperor, it is Dao Ancestor Wang. But Dao Ancestor Wang, old man, how can he take action easily?"</p>

    <p>"But with the Supreme King Kongque here, Emperor Dongda might be able to become Dao Ancestor Wang's successor..."</p>

    <p>The veterans and royal families of the two regions were talking below. They had all forgotten the previous hostility. On the one hand, they were attracted by the battle situation in the sky. On the other hand, they were still unable to fight.</p>

    <p>After a fight like this, the rest of the fight is completely meaningless.</p>

    <p>With the current methods of Edom the Great, it only takes a blink of an eye to destroy them.</p>

    <p>A bright fist knocked the Sun Goddess down from the sky. Emperor Dongda seized the opportunity and immediately controlled Kongque Mingwang Dharma to launch a counterattack.</p>

    <p>In just a few seconds, all the imperial destiny and spiritual power that the Nine Dragons had devoured were taken back.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Even Kowloon's own energy was plundered by Kongque Mingwang!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched the battle through the body of Emperor Dongda. From a distance, he could see that the nine-headed dragon rooted in the ground began to shrink rapidly. In a short period of time, it was like an earthworm.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Light Kongque King Ming Dharma he strengthened for Emperor Dongda is really too powerful...</p>

    <p>This is simply a plug-in. There is no need for Emperor Dongda to do it himself. He can clear up the entire battle situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>Kowloon Suzaku was swallowed directly...</p>

    <p>This ending is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>She had obviously used the power given by the Western Emperor. The Sun Goddess was still defeated. Her white body was dripping with blood. It was like a white flower oozing with blood.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda walked slowly to the Sun Goddess. Without any hesitation, he raised his hand. The palm of his hand shone with infinitely bright palm prints, spurting towards the Sun Girl.</p>

    <p>Under the sight of everyone, the Sun Goddess finally disappeared completely. Melted into the infinite light, leaving no trace...</p>

    <p>"It's all over." Emperor Dongda sighed in his heart. At the same time, he thanked Wang Ling: "Thank you, great god, for your help."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure?" Wang Ling responded. Being concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>"This battle is a battle to establish the country. The Western Emperor has always been cautious. Knowing that my Dharma has been promoted to the Supreme Light Kongque Ming King, he will not be able to attack me in the Eastern Region easily."</p>

    <p>The Eastern Emperor slowly said to Wang Ling: "This battle has at least won peace for my people in the Eastern Region for no less than a year. At least during my term of office, other forces will not dare to attack me again."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he waved his sleeves and looked at the white-robed manager over there: "Ye Ren, I will leave the rest of the matter to you. Send away all the intruders. They will not be allowed to step in again."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Ye Ren bowed.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, light flashed at Emperor Dongda's fingertips, repairing the injuries of all the veterans who participated in the war in the Eastern Region at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, he stepped into the back garden of the imperial palace.</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling saw the appearance of the Royal Garden of the Eastern Region Imperial Palace. This was originally a large field of elixirs. But many of them were destroyed during the battle. This made Emperor Dongda secretly feel regretful.</p>

    <p>But these elixirs. To Wang Ling these are all useless. The ones included in his King's Pants. Any one of them is much better than these.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda came to the Imperial Garden. The purpose was not to take Wang Ling to visit the ruins. Instead, he directly entered the secret passage leading to the underground palace.</p>

    <p>That is the location of the Sutra Pavilion under the Dongda Emperor Palace.</p>

    <p>According to the records in {Dongda Diary}.</p>

    <p>After the war, Emperor Dongda stayed alone in the Sutra Pavilion for three hours.</p>

    <p>After entering the underground Tibetan Scripture Pavilion, Emperor Dongda sat on the futon. He sighed and said, "I know. The great god must have a lot of questions to ask me. So I specially set aside time for the great god to ask questions..."</p>
