  <h1>Chapter 1278 Preparations before upgrading the earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk showed his extraordinary power in consecration and became the focus of the entire hospital for a while.</p>

    <p>Seeing that more and more people came to him to consecrate him, Jin Deng smiled slightly and expressed his attitude: "Dear donors, this poor monk is here to save people's lives. This matter requires everyone's cooperation and unity. Only then can it be achieved. After it is completed, anyone who has contributed can come to the poor monk's temple to find me. The poor monk has a lot of time to consecrate you..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the monk performed a Buddhist salute to everyone.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Master!"</p>

    <p>Now that the words have come to this point, those who were originally waiting in line for the consecration also understood.</p>

    <p>Their current behavior of queuing up for consecration is indeed inappropriate.</p>

    <p>Originally, they were hired to come here specifically to discuss the girl's condition.</p>

    <p>The matter of consecration has come to an end for now.</p>

    <p>In the conference room, the monk then turned his attention to the girl lying quietly in the medical cabin on the screen. He saw Heavenly Dao and Zhuo Yi standing next to him. He figured out what happened with just a few fingers.</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together and said to Lord Diulei: "Please, Zhenjun, please organize the order at the scene. I will go to Miss Sun's ward to see the situation."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Master." Lord Diulei nodded. He did not dare to slack off at all.</p>

    <p>Then, the monk turned around and his whole person turned into a void of light and shadow.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he appeared directly in the ward. This scene shocked Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>"Who are you!" Someone suddenly broke into the ward. This made Death Heavenly Dao particularly nervous.</p>

    <p>Especially after seeing that the person who came was a monk. Heavenly Dao became even more panicked.</p>

    <p>As soon as he saw the monk, he couldn't help but associate it with Chaodu.</p>

    <p>"No! He is a master! Protect Miss Sun!"</p>

    <p>In his heart, he almost subconsciously wanted to protect Sun Rong. He planned to attack the monk in front of him directly.</p>

    <p>However, what horrified Heavenly Dao was that he found that the spiritual energy he had just released was like a piece of ice baked under high temperature. It had completely melted in the palm of his hand before it even condensed.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao immediately thought of a situation. His expression was serious: "Who are you..."</p>

    <p>"It's true that Mr. Death and I haven't seen each other for a while. It's normal for Mr. Death not to remember me."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled at the death of Heavenly Dao: "The poor monk was selected into the Heavenly Dao white list in 1289."</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be Mr. Jin Deng..."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao instantly remembered this incident that seemed to have happened a long time ago.</p>

    <p>There are only a handful of users on Heavenly Dao's whitelist...</p>

    <p>And this Zen Master Jin Deng is the first person in history to enter the Heavenly Dao white list.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao certainly still remembers this matter.</p>

    <p>It's just that Zen Master Jin Deng keeps reincarnating. His appearance changes in each life. Now, when we meet again after countless years, Death Heavenly Dao can no longer recognize the face of Zen Master Jin Deng just based on his appearance.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren asked this poor monk to come here." At this time, the monk said.</p>

    <p>It was an expected answer. This did not surprise Heavenly Dao and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao, who died previously, heard that Wang Ling personally tried to invite an expert to help.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that this expert turned out to be Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "Just a few hours ago, the poor monk had a fight with Ling Zhenren. Then the poor monk decided to help Ling Zhenren deal with the matter."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "That's it."</p>

    <p>The monk scratched his head: "Don't you ask about the result of the duel?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "Anyway, if nothing else goes wrong, Mr. Jin Deng will definitely be beaten violently..."</p>

    <p>He wanted to save face for the monk, so he deliberately did not mention this matter.</p>

    <p>But who would have thought that this monk was so arrogant and didn't care about the issue of face or not at all.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Why can even you see the ending clearly? The poor monk is so arrogant." Regarding the words of Death Heavenly Dao, the monk sighed sincerely.</p>

    <p>He does not regret challenging Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I just simply felt that my original idea of being blindly confident was a bit stupid.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao saw the monk with a melancholy look on his face, so he had to comfort him: "The authorities are confused, but the onlookers are clear. Master, why should you care..."</p>

    <p>The monk was tired.</p>

    <p>However, he did not forget his mission.</p>

    <p>He has business to do here.</p>

    <p>"This yin and yang death catastrophe is caused by the ancient Golden Men who escaped. And the source of the death catastrophe is in that unspeakable place..." the monk said.</p>

    <p>"The unspeakable place..." This term made Heavenly Dao's pupils tremble.</p>

    <p>For the new Heavenly Dao, this is a familiar yet unfamiliar word... The number of Heavenly DaoGolden Men who know this is even more limited. Except for their six main Heavenly Dao who still have remaining memories, the other Heavenly Dao almost I have already forgotten that there is such a place.</p>

    <p>"It seems like you remembered it."</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Dao Ancestor's kindness back then would become a hidden danger today."</p>

    <p>"After all, the palms and backs of the hands are all flesh. You can say that Dao Ancestor is a kind man. But based on the poor monk's understanding of Dao Ancestor, Dao Ancestor's move must have a deeper meaning."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk turned his attention to the girl. He took out a magic weapon from the sleeve of his cassock.</p>

    <p>The monk's sleeve is like a pocket from another dimension. It is also called "the universe in the sleeve." It contains all the magic weapons collected by the monk in his 3910 lives. This is a huge treasure house.</p>

    <p>"This is?" Death Heavenly Dao asked, staring at the golden flower that Jin Deng took out.</p>

    <p>"This is the Buddha's Golden Lotus. It is specially used to seal the soul. Miss Sun's soul is affected by the calamity of death. She will leave her body from time to time. It is better to introduce her soul into the Golden Lotus and store it." The monk said.</p>

    <p>Buddha Golden Lotus is a sacred object.</p>

    <p>It is an existence comparable to the Heavenly Dao magic weapon.</p>

    <p>It contains the monk's 100 lifetimes of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Originally, the monk used it for his own use. Having such a Golden Lotus in hand can prevent all kinds of accidents.</p>

    <p>But now, he wants to join forces with Wang Ling to discover the secrets of the unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>It was a place that he had never entered in a thousand lifetimes.</p>

    <p>The monk used his 100 lifetimes of cultivation in exchange for a ticket to enter the unspeakable land. The monk felt that this was a very good deal.</p>

    <p>After entering the Buddha's Golden Lotus, the girl's soul will be temporarily sealed in the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>It can temporarily avoid the influence of "yin and yang death calamity."</p>

    <p>However, once the Buddha Golden Lotus takes in this "cursed" soul, the spiritual power sealed inside will begin to be consumed.</p>

    <p>100 lifetimes of cultivation can only be exchanged for a shelf life of 100 days at most.</p>

    <p>Therefore, they must resolve the matter in the Unspeakable Land within 100 days.</p>

    <p>The monk was a little worried.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if this time is enough.</p>

    <p>"What about the physical body? The soul is not here. It will decay..." At this time, Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"This is easy to handle."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jin Deng opened the medical cabin and reached out to touch the girl's forehead.</p>

    <p>Immediately, a golden light penetrated the girl's body: "It's okay. The light has been turned on."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Master. What should we do next?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun's physical body must be guarded day and night. The next step is that the poor monk will personally invite the Heavenly Dao star master. In order for the earth to complete the upgrade, the help of the Heavenly Dao star is still needed." Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>After saying that, he handed the Buddha Golden Lotus to Death Heavenly Dao and took another step forward.</p>

    <p>The monk's magic power is so profound that it is unimaginable.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, he shrunk to an inch. He crossed endless light years in one step... and arrived at the Heavenly Dao planet.</p>
