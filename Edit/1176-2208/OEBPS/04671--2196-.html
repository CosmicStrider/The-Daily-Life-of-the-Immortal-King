  <h1>Chapter 2196 Innovative Monk</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The interview that Lao Huang was talking about. This was something that had never happened before in the Itinerant Immortal game world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also didn't expect that after he seamlessly connected Lao Huang to the real world, Lao Huang started to directly plan his future work plan for himself. This is very similar to Lao Huang's original personality.</p>

    <p>He is an optimistic person who will not give up easily no matter what he encounters. Wherever he goes, he smiles like a little sun that can infect many people. Such a person is naturally a real workaholic. As long as it is a job that he really likes. He will give his 100% effort.</p>

    <p>Because in the game world, Lao Huang mentioned to them before that he was unemployed. He usually makes a living by doing online illustrations. Occasionally, he would also receive some large comic serialization subcontracting work and original painting subcontracting work.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang has personally participated in the popular Huaxiu nationally-created animation works {Sibuyi} and {Gengwang's Daily Life}.</p>

    <p>Therefore. In the real world, Wang Ling did not directly arrange a job for Lao Huang. I did not expect to meet today. Lao Huang has already become self-reliant.</p>

    <p>In the living room, Lao Huang poured a cup of tea for Wang Ling and Sun Rong each. This is the best Heavenly Dao broccoli tea...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a sip and felt something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He only asked Lord Diulei to finalize Lao Huang's residence. Unexpectedly, this guy actually included some private information in some details.</p>

    <p>However, Lao Huang actually had his own explanation as to why Heavenly Dao broccoli tea appeared in his home.</p>

    <p>He laughed: "As you know, I usually take on some outsourcing work such as illustrations and illustrations. The Office of Strategic Deception has invested in several popular Chinese comics before. So there are also some in my family. There will be some gifts from partners such as the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was silent.</p>

    <p>He found that the current development of AI has gone too far. How can he still make up for it on his own?</p>

    <p>"Come to think of it, Lao Huang. What are the innovative cultivators you mentioned before? What kind of organization are they?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>Regarding the concept of innovative cultivators, whether it is Sun Rong or Wang Ling, this is actually the first time I have heard of it.</p>

    <p>"That's right. You also know that since the Earth completed its upgrade, a lot of diplomatic relations have been opened up with aliens. This has also created many jobs."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said: "The private company I am preparing to interview for is actually a new company spawned by managing and coordinating disputes between aliens and ordinary human monks."</p>

    <p>"But the work of mediating disputes can be done by ordinary monks, right?" Sun Rong doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I'm also confused about this at the moment. But this company requires monks who have certain special skills to be recruited." Old Huang said. Then he took out the petals and started mixing colors.</p>

    <p>He squeezed a strip of black paint onto the paint board, then mixed it with a little white paint. Then he raised the brush with his right hand. A steady stream of light condensed from the palm of his hand and finally converged into the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>"Immortal Law Crane Wings!"</p>

    <p>Old Huang dabbed the paint and painted directly in the void. A pair of ink-style spiritual wings appeared and stuck directly on Old Huang's back.</p>

    <p>Immediately, Lao Huang took off lightly in his living room. He raised his hand to summon the traditional bow placed steadily on the shelf and aimed at the target on the wall of the living room to shoot accurately. Hit the bullseye!</p>

    <p>Every movement was done in one go. There was no sloppiness. It was obvious that Lao Huang was very comfortable with his method.</p>

    <p>"Old Huang. That's awesome!" Sun Rong immediately applauded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also clapped silently behind Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang laughed, snapped his fingers, and released his ink spiritual wings: "I majored in magical instruments in college, focusing on traditional bows. But in fact, I also did a lot of research on immortal painting. High school I was an art student at that time. I passed the art exam and entered cultivation University."</p>

    <p>For Lao Huang, that is already a thing of the past.</p>

    <p>Now that old things were brought up again, a bit of shyness appeared on his face.</p>

    <p>Directly materialize the paintings you have made. This kind of operation is not very uncommon. It can be said that there are many people in the Ink and Wash Lingyi Society. However, the operation is very difficult. It is difficult for people who do not have certain attainments in art to do it. this matter.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Lao Huang is talented. But Wang Ling does not think that he is an innovative cultivator as defined by the private enterprise.</p>

    <p>And just when Wang Ling was suspicious.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang took out a very honest-looking scroll from his bedroom.</p>

    <p>"Is this?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>"A Picture of All Living Beings, Mountains and Rivers."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang spread out the scroll and said.</p>

    <p>A thirty-meter-long scroll, shining with spiritual light, appeared in the void under the control of Old Huang. It caught the eyes of Wang Ling, Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that all the landscapes and figures in this painting are actually "alive." They seem to be really living in the painting. They have their own specific thinking. Some are chopping firewood, Some were fetching water and others were doing business in the market town at the foot of the mountain. There was a lot of traffic and it was very lively.</p>

    <p>This is a picture of all living beings in a cultivation market in ancient times. Although it can be seen at a glance that it is an imitation of Lao Huang's own handwriting, every detail of the characters is lifelike.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that these people, things, and things are all "alive"...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned: "That's amazing. Did you draw this alone?"</p>

    <p>"It just took a few hours. I'm unfamiliar. Otherwise it could be faster."</p>

    <p>Old Huang Versailles: "This can be regarded as an advanced version of the immortal method of painting. Although there are many people who can paint with the immortal method. But you need to be proficient in this advanced version of the ability. Unless you have mastered the immortal method of painting, The level of perfection. Plus your own understanding. Otherwise, it will never be possible."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a while.</p>

    <p>He couldn't deny that Lao Huang's skills were indeed worthy of being called an innovative cultivator.</p>

    <p>Painting with the immortal method. Concretely retain the paint paintings you have made. In addition to having strong and precise manipulation of your own spiritual power, you are also very strict with the painting itself. First of all, you must be quick. Secondly, the paint is attached to the paint. The spiritual power must be sufficient. Otherwise, the pair of black wings will not last long and will disintegrate.</p>

    <p>However, the advanced version of the ability mastered by Lao Huang was able to completely preserve such a long scroll containing landscapes and more than a thousand people.</p>

    <p>This is not much different from drawing a small world with freehand...</p>

    <p>Lao Huang humbly touched the back of his head and smiled: "But my little skills are probably a bit insignificant compared to the other people who went for the interview."</p>

    <p>He took out his mobile phone and showed a group chat for corporate interviews in front of Wang Ling and Sun Rong: "Everyone here has unique skills. And they are all unique geniuses in the world of cultivation! Are you interested in finding out more? I heard from the grapevine that the leader of this interview group... is a system expert!"</p>
