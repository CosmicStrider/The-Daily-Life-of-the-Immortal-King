  <h1>Chapter 1503 Ruthless Iron Handãƒ»Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling is peering through the King's Eyes at this strange sixth lady.</p>

    <p>A normal person has one hundred thousand hairs.</p>

    <p>If all the hair on Mrs. Six's head is bound to a ghost. That means. Madame Six is at least in charge of 100,000 soldiers.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Although it is easy to pull out your hair, you must also consider the seriousness of the consequences.</p>

    <p>Mainly Wang Ling currently we don't know if all these 100,000 hairs are bound to ghosts.</p>

    <p>And once you pull it out yourself.</p>

    <p>Will the ghosts escape from Madam Six's control and form a new round of riots?</p>

    <p>These are all situations that Wang Ling needs to take into account.</p>

    <p>Even if these ghosts are rioting, it will not be difficult for Wang Ling to clean them up.</p>

    <p>Mainly. These ghosts are difficult to control.</p>

    <p>Once something in a free state is dispersed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's ability to empty will also cause many innocent people to suffer.</p>

    <p>So after considering the above situation comprehensively, Wang Ling thought of a way.</p>

    <p>Since he couldn't guarantee whether the ghosts would disperse and cause a new problem.</p>

    <p>Then he can start pulling them out one by one...</p>

    <p>First, explore slowly. Finally, decide whether to continue to increase efforts based on the actual situation.</p>

    <p>"There is indeed something wrong with these three people."</p>

    <p>In front of the mirror, Madam Six took the white hair that fell off because of Yang's sacrifice alone.</p>

    <p>This white hair has become curled and withered. There is no moisture at all.</p>

    <p>It's as fragile as a hairspring. If you pinch it lightly, it will branch and break.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this fallen White Hair is still useful.</p>

    <p>"Demon spirit. You should be able to see it through White Hair, right?" Madam Six asked.</p>

    <p>"This is easy."</p>

    <p>The sharp and harsh female voice inside her spoke.</p>

    <p>As the core center for the Sixth Lady to control all ghosts, the ability of the hair demon is not only to use ghosts to complete various tasks through ultra-long range, or to directly use hair to control the human body.</p>

    <p>Turn those people into the puppets they want.</p>

    <p>If there is even a trace of the ghost bound to the hair, the hair will wither like a withered flower.</p>

    <p>As the core, demon spirits naturally have the ability to see the reasons why these "hairs" wither.</p>

    <p>And for this kind of ability, the demons also call it "The Shining."</p>

    <p>She could easily see what happened before Zhang Sacrifice "withered."</p>

    <p>Before taking action, the demon spirit sneered: "Would you like to guess who did it?"</p>

    <p>"I still doubt that person named Wang Xiaoer."</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady replied: "I heard that there was another female teaching assistant among the people accompanying them. This is someone who has not been reported before. Moreover, this female teaching assistant seems to have an unusual relationship with Wang Xiaoer."</p>

    <p>"Do teachers and students fall in love? It's interesting."</p>

    <p>"I don't know the specific situation. But...there must be something wrong with this person. Otherwise, Huaxiu Country wouldn't suddenly send additional manpower." Madam Six calmly analyzed: "Real masters don't need protection. I'm afraid. I'm worried that this person will act too out of the ordinary and cause some controversy."</p>

    <p>"No matter what, you'll know after just one look." The demon smiled and said, "Leave it to me. Just like before. Madam, please give me the control of your body for a short time..."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Mrs. Six nodded.</p>

    <p>This is the content of the contract. According to the contract agreement, the demon spirit has a time limit.</p>

    <p>So every time she switched souls, the Sixth Madam didn't have the slightest concern.</p>

    <p>Because she is the owner of the contract and has full control over the demon spirits.</p>

    <p>For about one breath, Mrs. Six's black pupils turned into a pink color, just like the pink lipstick of Death Barbie that often appears in those TV series.</p>

    <p>After the demon spirit took possession of her body, except for the color of her eyes, there were almost no other changes in the appearance of the Sixth Madam.</p>

    <p>It's just that the surrounding temperature will drop suddenly and become cold.</p>

    <p>But if someone sees it at this time, it will definitely feel weird.</p>

    <p>A thin layer of frost began to form on the dressing mirror in front of me.</p>

    <p>The demon couldn't help but curl his lips.</p>

    <p>She confidently reached out and pointed at the white hair on the table and began to use her ability to test it.</p>

    <p>Pink fluorescence seeped out from the palm of my hand.</p>

    <p>It shined on that white hair like a searchlight for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>"Um?"</p>

    <p>Then, the demon spirit made a confused sound.</p>

    <p>"What did you see?" Mrs. Six asked.</p>

    <p>"Didn't see anything."</p>

    <p>There was a big question mark on the demon spirit's head: "I just saw it. A mosaic."</p>

    <p>"How could this happen?"</p>

    <p>"I'm surprised too. I've never encountered this situation before."</p>

    <p>The demon frowned: "I'll try again."</p>

    <p>After repeated operations, the result is still the same.</p>

    <p>It's still a mosaic.</p>

    <p>And the more you observe, the thicker the mosaic becomes.</p>

    <p>It's almost to the point of being insane.</p>

    <p>"Can you project the picture you see on the mirror as before? I want to see it." Mrs. Six applied.</p>

    <p>"Of course." The demon smiled nonchalantly: "I have no reason to lie to you. We are one."</p>

    <p>At this time, one person and one ghost obviously did not realize the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>And just when the demon projected the mosaic he saw onto the mirror, a hand with distinct phalanges and clearly visible knuckles appeared in the mosaic.</p>

    <p>Um?</p>

    <p>What is this?!</p>

    <p>One person and one ghost. Covered at the same time.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a kind of panic surged over their heads, replacing all their thoughts at the moment.</p>

    <p>You can't run away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his heart.</p>

    <p>Covering it with only one hand, the huge spiritual pressure dropped suddenly, causing the sixth lady's body to suddenly sink. Except for the head, every inch of the body was directly stuffed into the earth.</p>

    <p>That feeling cannot be described in words.</p>

    <p>It almost made the sixth lady and the demon spirit in her body explode in an instant.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>What happened?</p>

    <p>Why did a hand suddenly appear in the mirror?</p>

    <p>And it also has such huge power...</p>

    <p>"Senior should also be a ghost, right?"</p>

    <p>The demon spirit asked tentatively: "I wonder if I have offended my senior in any way?"</p>

    <p>She was trying to test it out.</p>

    <p>Facing the hand that suddenly emerged from the mirror, she and Mrs. Six were frightened out of their wits.</p>

    <p>Ghost?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt speechless for a while.</p>

    <p>This demon doesn't seem very smart.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter. Misunderstandings will be misunderstood.</p>

    <p>There was no need for him to explain all this anyway.</p>

    <p>He was not polite. He directly attacked the trapped Sixth Madam. He was hesitating whether to start with the hair at the hairline or the hair on the top of the head...</p>

    <p>After making a decision using "Point of Sesame", Wang Ling pinched a piece of hair above the head. Then he pulled it sharply.</p>

    <p>"Ya!" Mrs. Six and Mo Linton both screamed at the same time.</p>

    <p>They felt as if their scalp was being electrified. There was a strong burning sensation!</p>

    <p>The moment the hair was pulled out, it felt like even the scalp was about to be removed!</p>

    <p>The demon spirit was extremely frightened.</p>

    <p>This ghost is too aloof. Not only is it powerful, but it also doesn't speak the whole time!</p>

    <p>I actually had to pull my hair out as soon as I started!</p>

    <p>Asshole!</p>

    <p>This hurts!</p>

    <p>The demon roared in his heart.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling discovered that after pulling out a hair, it seemed that a ghost had really been released and was wandering in the room.</p>

    <p>So he easily caught the ghost.</p>

    <p>"Pfft!"</p>

    <p>Use two fingers to crush the released ghost.</p>

    <p>The green blood, which is difficult for ordinary cultivators to detect, sprayed out on the spot in the sixth lady's room like exploding beef balls.</p>

    <p>This is the blood that belongs exclusively to ghosts.</p>

    <p>Because the Sixth Madam and the demon spirit have two souls in one body, even the Bloody Sixth Madam can see it.</p>

    <p>When the green blood spurted out, the sixth lady was splashed all over her body and face.</p>

    <p>The scene was like a horror movie and made the sixth lady tremble.</p>

    <p>"Senior... please forgive me, senior!" One person and one ghost cried out in fright.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling was ruthless. Not giving any chance at all, he started pulling out the second hair.</p>

    <p>Every time I pull one out, I crush a released ghost. It's so steady...</p>

    <p>Poor Mrs. Six's scalp was numb from the plucking. The strong burning sensation and the pain of peeling skin occurred every time Wang Ling was pulled out.</p>

    <p>But pulling them out one by one is too slow...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is pleased to be plucking.</p>

    <p>But I heard Wang Ming's urging voice on the other side.</p>

    <p>It was said that Yingxian Heming had finished using the toilet.</p>

    <p>"Hey...it's not completely done yet." Wang Ling frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He looked at the two bald spots on Mrs. Six's head that were the size of thumbnails. He felt a pity in his heart.</p>

    <p>But now, it seems that the only option is to temporarily take back his "ruthless iron hand."</p>

    <p>When preparing to take your hand back from the mirror.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly thought. Anyway, the Sixth Lady and the demon seemed to have regarded themselves as "ghosts."</p>

    <p>Then maybe it would be better to leave a name as a deterrent.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling put his hand directly on the thin frost on the dressing mirror.</p>

    <p>I left my name - Houlang...</p>

    <p>These two simple words gave the Sixth Madam and the demon spirit a great shock and a great sense of shame.</p>

    <p>Holy shit Houlang...</p>
