  <h1>Chapter 1883 This world is really too small</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Amidst Zhuo Yi's series of strong men acting coquettishly, Wang Ling's spirit began to become a little trance-like.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he suddenly felt that the world was really too small.</p>

    <p>Of course, all these arrangements and coincidences can also be said to be a kind of luck. Although he did not impose the "Great Luck Technique" on himself, Qin Zhong is the only koi in the world of cultivation that he has designated.</p>

    <p>With this koi, their luck will not be too bad.</p>

    <p>Liu Muchen, the president of the Central Auction House, is the only candidate to hold the four-domain intelligence network. No one can replace Liu Muchen as an excellent middleman in the eternity of time.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, whether Zhuo Yi can play the role of Liu Muchen well is still a question.</p>

    <p>All in all, it is impossible for the real Liu Muchen to do such a thing as crying for his father and mother and pounce on others when he sees them... This, this, this, he actually rubs his head in his arms. How unbecoming is this? !</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pushed Zhuo Yi's head away with a calm expression. He sighed in his heart. He felt that Zhuo Yi was not sensitive at all.</p>

    <p>If Jiugong Liangzi sees it, she will definitely be jealous!</p>

    <p>"That's not right. How do you understand this?" At this moment, Wang Ying suddenly sent a message to Wang Ling and asked. As the shadow of Wang Ling, he and Wang Ling had a connected mind. So he was thinking about things at Wang Ling. He discovered a blind spot.</p>

    <p>As a young man who doesn't understand style and has always regarded himself as having a paralyzed face, he actually knows how to be "jealous." This makes Wang Ying feel incredible.</p>

    <p>Facing Wang Ying's question, Wang Ling felt that Wang Ying was making a big fuss. Of course, he had never experienced all kinds of emotions that normal people should have. Naturally, he didn't know what it felt like to be jealous.</p>

    <p>But it's not that he doesn't completely understand what jealousy means. To be precise, Wang Ling knows the literal state of every emotion.</p>

    <p>Emotions like jealousy are classified as a "special possessiveness" in the dictionary of Wang Ling. For example, when you see something or someone you like and get closer to others, you will have it. Such a reaction.</p>

    <p>In this regard, Wang Ling took the time to give an example to Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>For example, he often feels this way when he sees others eating limited-edition crispy noodles that he cannot buy!</p>

    <p>"This is jealousy! This is definitely jealousy!" Wang Ying held his head. He felt that Wang Ling's understanding of jealousy seemed to have some strange deviation...</p>

    <p>But obviously, now is not the time to discuss this.</p>

    <p>Their biggest task now is to assemble the four emperors, start a secret meeting in advance, and then set up a trap to invite them into the urn and lure Peng Xiren out.</p>

    <p>As the core of this plan, Zhuo Yi will play a vital role in the following plot.</p>

    <p>"Master, don't worry. This disciple is confident about this! You don't even need to move. You are here in Chunlan Tower. I will use Liu Muchen's method to call the other emperors here." Zhuo Yi promised with all his heart.</p>

    <p>As we all know, in the world of eternal cultivation, the person with the highest status besides Dao Ancestor Wang is the Four Emperors who are in charge of the four realms of the universe.</p>

    <p>It is extremely difficult for normal cultivators to meet the Great Emperor under normal circumstances. As for the four emperors being able to assemble at a certain designated place in an instant, it is even more impossible for ordinary people to think.</p>

    <p>But Liu Muchen has this special appeal.</p>

    <p>Even Zhang Zhui was curious: "Even if Liu Muchen has served as Dao Ancestor Wang's bodyguard, can he really have such a big reputation to invite other emperors? There must be some other reasons for this. Are you holding on to it? What do you have to threaten them?"</p>

    <p>"Threat? How is this possible... This Liu Muchen was Dao Ancestor Wang's former bodyguard after all. How could he do such a dirty thing? And the object of this threat is the emperor. Although Liu Muchen is strong, if he offends four emperors at the same time, I'm afraid. It isn't easy to handle?" Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>After Zhang Zhui heard this, he frowned, nodded and said, "That's true."</p>

    <p>But now everyone is becoming more and more curious. What method will Liu Muchen use to call the other three emperors here.</p>

    <p>As a result, Zhuo Yi just took out a storage bag from Liu Muchen. During the few days without getting along with Wang Ling, he was not idle either. He had been passing on the memories passed to him through Liu Muchen. Study your own identity. Take on the role. Then wait for the opportunity.</p>

    <p>He knew that he would definitely get along with Wang Ling. So he was already familiar with everything early on.</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, what Zhuo Yi took out from Liu Muchen's exclusive storage bag was very simple. It was an ordinary crystal communication ball. It is a relatively advanced communication in the world of eternal cultivation.</p>

    <p>Different from ordinary communication charms, it can not only accommodate more spiritual imprints corresponding to different cultivators, but also establish a huge address book network.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that you can directly realize face-to-face video calls and project the images into the void.</p>

    <p>"You are so close that you can just use the communication ball to shake people?" Emperor Dongda was dumbfounded by this and expressed shock.</p>

    <p>Although he also has Liu Muchen's communication ball contact information, as one of the four emperors, he knows that he has to call out the emperor-level figures to the designated place... Even if it is Liu Muchen, the process will not be so convenient. !</p>

    <p>But now Liu Muchen actually "called" people directly to shake people off, but that's okay...</p>

    <p>The relationship between him and the other three emperors has gotten so good?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Emperor Dongda began to feel a sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. It's not as outrageous as you think." Zhuo Yi showed a mysterious smile.</p>

    <p>Then he started to use the communication crystal ball to contact Emperor Xi directly: "Xiao Xi, you can come over. Yes. The Chunlan Tower on the Central Trading Star is opened next to the temple."</p>

    <p>Xiaoxiaoxiao... Xiaoxi?</p>

    <p>This familiar name once again surprised everyone.</p>

    <p>Are you sure the person named this is the Great Emperor? Not the younger brother?</p>

    <p>Why do you feel like a gangster calling his younger brother? (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻!</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda's mentality collapsed. He never expected that the relationship between Emperor Xi and Liu Muchen had gotten so good.</p>

    <p>It would be outrageous to call him Xiaoxi directly!</p>

    <p>However, just as he was vomiting three liters of blood, the voice of the Western Emperor also came from the crystal ball: "Um... are you sure? King Tiankun is dead. I am still dealing with the chaos. The courtiers need to report it. I directly sent troops to attack the Eastern Region. I'm still fighting Tai Chi with them..."</p>

    <p>"Ignore them. You find an excuse to get away. Come directly here. My master, master's wife, senior Zhang Zhui, brother Wang Zhen, Miss Liu Qingyi, Taoist priest You Yueqing, and brother Qin Zhong are all here." Zhuo Yi spoke. After saying this, everyone finally understood and heard some clues.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong understood it instantly. There was a look of realization on his face: "Zhuo Yi Senior, this Western Emperor is not the same..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi just smiled and said: "Yes! This Emperor of the West is actually Senior Li Xian. Brother Qin Zhong and I have done nothing else in the past few days since we came to the Eternal World. We just used this communication crystal. The ball was called. Unexpectedly, every hit was accurate..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was even more shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "The other two great emperors..."</p>

    <p>"Master's wife is right. The other two emperors are also ours. The Northern Emperor is Xiang Yi's brother. As for the only female emperor, the Southern Emperor, she is senior Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>"Jin... Jin Deng senior..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. They all acted very well. There is no cheating. Senior Jin Deng has had the experience of being a woman in several reincarnations. It is more than enough to play an empress."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"That is to say, it seems that except for the Gu Shunzhi brothers, we have found all the people who have traveled to the eternal world."</p>

    <p>"No. There is Ying'er. Ying'er is not with me."</p>

    <p>"Oh. That's it. Don't worry, Master. I haven't finished typing the address book yet. I'll ask Senior Qin Zhong to stand by and type a few more, maybe it will be done!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
