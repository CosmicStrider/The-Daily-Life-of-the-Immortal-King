  <h1>Chapter 1668 Containing Creatures SCB-Ninety Six</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the news of the death of the sixteen New Ancient Divine Weapons headed by Jin Yan was transmitted from the spiritual connection hub to Nawei's brain, a slight tingling feeling was immediately transmitted.</p>

    <p>This tingling has no effect on the body itself. It simply expresses a signal that the spiritual connection hub has been completely interrupted.</p>

    <p>This means that the sixteen New Ancient Divine Weapons headed by Jin Yan who are close to God level are completely hopeless.</p>

    <p>The material of New Ancient Divine Weapons is very special. It has the ability to model regeneration. Under normal circumstances, even if it is severely damaged, it can still be rescued. Even if part of the body is lost, and the regeneration function is limited. As long as there is still something on the body More than 30% of the mechanical tissue is still viable.</p>

    <p>In other words, as long as there is at least 30% of the mechanical tissue, it will not reach the point where the spiritual connection hub is directly disconnected.</p>

    <p>Nawei's face was full of disbelief. He never expected that the combined combat power of Jin Yan and others he sent could not match that "Gong"...</p>

    <p>However, this made him feel even more excited.</p>

    <p>This proves that his vision is correct. This "Mr. Gong" is indeed a good material for him to further realize the "Ultimate EditionÂ·New Ancient Divine Weapons."</p>

    <p>Of course. Regarding the failure of Jin Yan and others, it actually makes Nawei reflect.</p>

    <p>He felt that in terms of combat power, Jin Yan and others should not be crushed and beaten. Maybe it had something to do with the order he gave at the beginning to bring this "Mr. Gong" back alive. This led to Jin Yan and others were restrained when they took action. As a result, the opponent found an opportunity.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that there is no need to restrain our hands.</p>

    <p>Back then, his master, Master Wu Xin, was regarded as a being who "chases souls in the underworld." Even a dead person could be saved within forty-eight hours by relying on his uncanny mechanical parts.</p>

    <p>Of course, it would be best if he could be captured alive directly, because this would save Nawei a lot of trouble. But now there is really no need for this.</p>

    <p>"Pass on my command."</p>

    <p>At this time, Nawei thought for a moment and said to the spherical guards in front of him: "I want to liberate the containment device."</p>

    <p>This instruction made these spherical guards visibly stunned, because this was a very dangerous move.</p>

    <p>Nawei needs to order the confirmation process again.</p>

    <p>A spherical guard issued a warning using an electronic sound: "A release and containment order has been detected. This order may lead to unpredictable dangers. The contained creatures are still in an uncontrollable state."</p>

    <p>Just underneath this castle, there are countless sheltered weird creatures.</p>

    <p>These creatures were all for the purpose of conducting experiments on New Ancient Divine Weapons. They were forcibly imprisoned in specific Rubik's Cube containers by Master Wu Xin using some means.</p>

    <p>They are strange and weird. They are strong. They have certain weaknesses. But they cannot be killed completely...</p>

    <p>"I know." Nawei smiled and said, "There has never been an effective way to deal with these guys. Nawei Mr. Gong is so strong. There must be something to deal with, right? Borrow his help. Hands. Let the active sheltered creatures consume part of their physical strength. At the same time, it will also wear down his own strength... In the end, I will send out the new team of New Ancient Divine Weapons to double-team. I will definitely bring him to me."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, the sphere guards already know what Nawei wants to do.</p>

    <p>It's nothing more than wearing each other's physical strength down and reaping the benefits in the end.</p>

    <p>But it's hard to say whether it will really go smoothly in practice.</p>

    <p>Because those who have the ability to house creatures are weird and extremely cruel. They are difficult to control and can easily hurt innocent people.</p>

    <p>However, Nawei seemed particularly confident about this: "It doesn't matter. That Mr. Gong seems to be a warm-hearted person. Dealing with such a warm-hearted person, it will be more interesting to put these uncertain factors aside. Even if If something really happened to someone, the worst case scenario is to pay for it. For the future development of the Imperial City, necessary sacrifices are sometimes necessary."</p>

    <p>"Then how do you want to liberate and contain the creatures?"</p>

    <p>"Directly use the technique of space teleportation to teleport the Rubik's Cube used for containment. Of course, the automatic release program must be set before sending it over."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the light of the spherical guard flickered, and soon the light from the mechanical eyes was projected. Along with the numbers that kept beating in the void, a series of information about the containment of living beings and the corresponding containment numbers were clearly projected in the void.</p>

    <p>Sphere Guard: "Please choose which of the contained creatures to release first..."</p>

    <p>Nawei touched his chin and smiled: "SCB-096. Just enable it first."</p>

    <p>SCB-096. A creature in the eternal Dao God realm. Today's realm strength has reached the Dao Ancestor realm.</p>

    <p>This is the weird guy that his master captured from the back side of the moon in the eons of time from Master Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>Rabbit, human form. But because he has a pair of rabbit buck teeth, he has a strong inferiority complex. He always covers his mouth on weekdays. Only his beautiful ruby-like eyes are exposed... He seems to be a gentle and elegant person. , a creature with a very gentlemanly air. But when it comes to cruelty, it means he doesn't even recognize his relatives.</p>

    <p>Of all the people who saw its buck teeth, no one could survive...</p>

    <p>In order to study the tooth structure of New Ancient Divine Weapons, Nawei had to deal with SCB-096 a lot. There were several times when SCB-096 almost killed him. It gnawed his throat with its buck teeth.</p>

    <p>Now. SCB-096 is liberated again. Nawei actually has to admit. It actually feels a bit like a public revenge.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure that the creatures that need to be liberated are the creatures contained in SCB-096 (also known as: Material Pack Number 096)?"</p>

    <p>"Confirmed..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. The system has understood. It will be transmitted according to the specified coordinate position after a countdown of 120 seconds..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the game hall. Wang Ling emptied the last gold coin bulldozer. Satisfied, he exchanged the 200,000 game coins he just won for 20,000 gold gear coins.</p>

    <p>He is not a greedy person. From the beginning, he never had the idea of eating up all the capital of the arcade. He just needs to save enough money to buy crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>"Sir, let's go slowly!" The person in charge of the game hall had tears in his eyes. He stood at the door with his workers and sent Wang Ling away. He waved his sleeves. His heart was full of sympathy for Wang Ling. }I was moved to show mercy. I even welcomed him to come back next time.</p>

    <p>Very satisfied with this. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I think this arcade has great future.</p>

    <p>As one of his cash machines in this world. Wang Ling feels that as long as this imperial city continues to operate, places like the video game arcade must be preserved.</p>

    <p>Of course, he won't just "gather sheep" in one house. If the sheep are bald, he will have no place to make a small amount of money...</p>

    <p>The Wang family's family motto has always told him that he cannot use his own abilities to make money in the real world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling naturally remembers this family motto.</p>

    <p>But where he is now is not the real world. It is a different world!</p>

    <p>Therefore. It cannot be considered a violation.</p>

    <p>I was about to go to the snack shop opened by Xiang Yi in another world to buy dry noodles.</p>

    <p>I had just walked less than 500 meters to the entrance of the canteen. Suddenly, there was an earth-shaking loud noise.</p>

    <p>A cube eight meters long and eight meters wide fell from the sky like a meteor from a strange direction. It smashed the canteen in front of me to pieces on the spot...</p>

    <p>This scene. Wang Ling has seen it before.</p>

    <p>Just seven years ago...</p>

    <p>It was the same scene when the gate to another world came.</p>

    <p>As a result, this time it happened to be when he was buying snacks...</p>
