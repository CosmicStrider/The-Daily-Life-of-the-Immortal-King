  <h1>Chapter 1815 My shield is endless</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this point, the Skeleton Prince clearly knew that there was no chance of winning against the boy in front of him using head-on methods. This boy from Earth was too weird... with a weirdness that he had never seen before. It made people wonder. An indescribable weird feeling. what did he eat to grow up. He can actually be so strong.</p>

    <p>He thought of a very strange Eternal One. He was also a miraculous genius who once had control over the power of the universe. Unfortunately, this genius overestimated his own strength before he developed into a mature person. He tried to challenge the alien gods. As a result, he was swallowed up by the palace. He never came back.</p>

    <p>Now facing Wang Ling. The Skeleton Prince has reason to believe that Wang Ling may be the reincarnation of the legendary genius.</p>

    <p>"King of all appearances... Li Luo." At this time, he stared at Wang Ling and asked tentatively.</p>

    <p>"Li Luo?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly. He quickly remembered this person... because according to the Corpse Map list compiled by Zhang Zhui and Li Xian, it was in the Supreme Corpse Map in his hand. There was indeed one. The skeleton called Li Luo.</p>

    <p>That was when Dao Ancestor Wang broke into the Palace of the Outer Gods and rescued him from a narrow escape. When he was rescued, Li Luo only had a mutilated skeleton. It is also one of the few remaining limbs in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know why the Skeleton Prince equated the Eternal One, who was once known as the King of All Forms, with himself. However, judging from the misunderstood expression on the other party's face, it is not difficult to guess that the snow-white skeleton in front of him should be the right one. What misunderstanding did he have?</p>

    <p>"I know. If I confront you head-on, I'm afraid I won't be able to defeat you. But I still have other ways to deal with you." At this time, the Skeleton Prince said.</p>

    <p>He used his last bit of strength and condensed a large amount of spiritual energy to distort the surrounding void. At this time, the white finger bones were disassembled with a "crack", and then suddenly shot forward with a whoosh.</p>

    <p>This is a human bullet created from his finger bones. It is extremely fast and has a surging spiritual light. It rolls up huge waves of spiritual patterns in the void and shoots straight into the sky.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remained motionless, because he could see that the human bullet was not aimed at him. The Skeleton Prince's target was not him, but...</p>

    <p>"I know, it's despicable to use such methods in a duel. But now, as long as I can win, it doesn't matter if I am a little despicable. If you want to ensure the safety of the girl next to you, I advise you not to make any resistance."</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince spoke like this. His words were cold. But the finger bones he fired were heading towards Sun Rong over there.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong is in a static state due to the effect of time-stop.</p>

    <p>In fact, as early as the moment the Skeleton Prince appeared, the layout had been planned in advance. A space passage directly aimed at Sun Rong was secretly set up in the narrow secret room.</p>

    <p>Even if he is later pulled into a different space, he can also use this space channel to directly use Sun Rong as a hostage to blackmail Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This idea seemed perfect to the Skeleton Prince.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, the Skeleton Prince did not expect that the moment he arranged the space passage, Wang Ling had already thought of a countermeasure to protect Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>So at this time, he didn't listen to the Skeleton Prince's orders at all. He walked towards the Skeleton Prince step by step.</p>

    <p>"Don't come here... don't touch me!"</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince shouted. However, when he saw that the boy's pace still showed no intention of stopping, he became anxious on the spot. He looked at Wang Ling in disbelief: "You really don't care about this girl's life!? Forget it... Then let's kill this woman first! Even if I have to die, I'll take someone with me!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, he had a thought in his mind. The finger bone that he shot out before suddenly penetrated the space channel and stabbed forward.</p>

    <p>However, the fingers, which were extremely sharp and beyond the scope of knowledge of cultivators on earth, were blocked by a layer of bright red light shield with the same eye color as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince remotely controlled the phalanges. First he exerted force. As a result, he did not pass through the shield added by Wang Ling to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling still slowly approaching him. The Skeleton Prince became anxious on the spot: "You... you have the courage to stand still and let me break your shield first! I don't believe I can't even break your shield!"</p>

    <p>"It's useless."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>He sighed softly and stopped for the time being to watch the Skeleton Prince's performance.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I felt that this Skeleton Prince had a silly cuteness. He knew clearly that he was outmatched, but he still had to use this threatening method to deal with him.</p>

    <p>At this time, the expression on the Skeleton Prince's snow-white bones as he tried to break through the shield with all his strength was ridiculous. Even the color of the bones was covered with a layer of red.</p>

    <p>This was a blow that he had exerted all his strength to push down. In the end, his fingertips were spinning directly on the shield like a drill at a super high speed!</p>

    <p>This speed is astonishing! It reaches one trillion times in one second! He concentrated all the damage on one point of the shield. He tried to use the strongest pressure to break Wang Ling's spiritual shield!</p>

    <p>Finally. After about five minutes of trying...</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince has seen the light!</p>

    <p>He finally saw it!</p>

    <p>He poked a small gap in the shield. Then the gap soon cracked in all directions like a spider web.</p>

    <p>"It's broken! It's finally broken!"</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince cried with excitement. His fingertips were all worn flat. He used all his strength to finally see the broken shield!</p>

    <p>But at the same time, new despair came again.</p>

    <p>Because he discovered that there was actually a layer of shield behind the shield...</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be a nesting-doll-style shield with multiple structures..." The Skeleton Prince scratched his head. He did not fight Wang Ling. Instead, he directly fought against the shield. He was so addicted to breaking the shield that he couldn't do anything.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling fiercely: "If I didn't break all your shields today, I... wouldn't have the shame to hang around in this world of cultivation!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his mouth and tried to persuade the Skeleton Prince.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to persuade me! I have made up my mind! You don't have to worry that I will get in the way. I will make my finger bones invisible later... Those earth cultivators' magic power and monitoring equipment cannot see my existence at all. Wait until I break all the shields, and then I will fight with you!" The Skeleton Prince vowed to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed infinitely in his heart.</p>

    <p>He looked at the persistent Skeleton Prince and really didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>Normal multiple spiritual shields can only have dozens of layers at most. Because of the structure, the outer layers of the spiritual shield require more spiritual energy to be constructed. This is a proportional consumption.</p>

    <p>Shields with multiple structures often require the combined spiritual power of multiple cultivators to deploy them.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's spiritual power is endless.</p>

    <p>In addition, he has always had a stable personality.</p>

    <p>So when we first arranged it.</p>

    <p>Just put 100 million layers on Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Obviously, the Skeleton Prince did not realize the seriousness of the problem at this time.</p>
