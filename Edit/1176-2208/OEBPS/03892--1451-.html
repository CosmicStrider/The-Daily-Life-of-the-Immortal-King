  <h1>Chapter 1451 Sun Yiyuan's strong support</h1>

  <div>

    <p>15 billion. For the extremely wealthy Huaguo Shuilian Group, this amount is not too large.</p>

    <p>Compared with the "Dream Dedicated Fund" that Sun Yiyuan uses every year for stock trading, investment, charity and realizing dreams for others, 15 billion is just a drop in the bucket.</p>

    <p>However, in order to mobilize such a huge sum of money, it still needs to be approved within the family.</p>

    <p>That night, after Sun Rong made this decision, the senior management of the group who had not yet discussed it were all shocked. They quickly got up from the bed to inquire about the situation.</p>

    <p>In their knowledge, the girl who has always been well-behaved and sensible has never behaved like this in handling huge sums of money.</p>

    <p>Several group executives quickly held a video conference. They discussed the use of this huge amount of funds in their respective homes.</p>

    <p>"Invest in scientific research projects? Or for that internet celebrity scientist Shou Chong?"</p>

    <p>A group board of directors of the senior frowned: "This project must be compensated ... in my opinion, that Shou Chong is a liar. In fact, there are a lot of such liars in the private sector, specializing in the invention of some useless treasures to eat royalties and eye-catching."</p>

    <p>"So it's this person. I know."</p>

    <p>One person nodded and said: "I remember that Fan Xing was seriously injured a while ago. It seems to be related to this person. Although a fully automatic escape apartment was designed, it was said that it was due to insufficient funds and not being responsible for the landing... which led to Fan Xing After landing, he fell into a humanoid slime."</p>

    <p>"I also have an impression of this..."</p>

    <p>"The key is that we oppose it. It should be useless. The final decision lies with Old Sun..." Another board member sighed.</p>

    <p>They are just small shareholders. Although they have the right to object and participate in meetings.</p>

    <p>But if Mr. Boss Sun makes the final decision, there really is no room for maneuver on this matter.</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Yiyuan still holds the majority share.</p>

    <p>So now the question comes. Why does this young lady, who has always been sensible and obedient, have a relationship with this popular internet celebrity scientist...</p>

    <p>This matter has left many directors puzzled.</p>

    <p>Board members currently in video conference. There are sixteen people in total.</p>

    <p>It is related to their own interests. These people integrate the intelligence network in their hands. They can also obtain some intelligence.</p>

    <p>About half an hour later, someone received an anonymous intelligence message: "I know. This matter... seems to be related to the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>"Jiugong family? I remember they just sent Jiugong Liangzi, who is known as the symbol of the younger generation of the Jiugong family, to come over for exchange and study. They also specially chose Number 60 High School..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. This information is very reasonable. Maybe all the disputes this time started because of the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>A director said: "According to my information, the young lady from the Jiugong family first approached Shou Chong... and Sun Rong most likely decided to symbolize it out of anger."</p>

    <p>"Did you come up with the idea of investing because you were angry?" Many board members laughed loudly in the video.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the Sun family said that Director Sun Rong was well-behaved and had a unique vision. However, such youthful behavior still made the old fritters on the board of directors laugh.</p>

    <p>After all, it's a girl's house...</p>

    <p>Someone who will inherit the family business and manage an entire group in the future. Now it seems that he still lacks a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>"By the way. Is the information reliable?"</p>

    <p>"100% reliable. But the source of the information... allow me to keep it secret."</p>

    <p>"Forget it. It doesn't matter where you got the news. Just be reliable. Also, do you know why these two young ladies were angry and invested in this Shou Chong?" said the board member who initially jumped out to object.</p>

    <p>His surname is Fan. His given name is Fan Mingliang. Fan Xing is actually his nephew.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Fan Mingliang almost has a natural dislike for Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>He wanted to find out as much as possible about the situation, because in this way, there would be enough reasons to prove that this investment was due to the grudge between the eldest ladies, which ultimately blocked the group's funding.</p>

    <p>In order for the girl not to lose her reputation as a prodigal daughter. According to Boss Sun's temper, there is a high probability that he will agree to block the funding.</p>

    <p>And in fact... during a video call with members of the board of directors.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun is also learning the details in depth.</p>

    <p>The other party on the video call is still Chief Secretary Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"Master, 15 billion. It's not a small amount..." Jiang Xiaoche's expression looked serious.</p>

    <p>"What's the reaction from the board of directors?" Sun Yiyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"They thought that this was the result of the grudge between the young lady and the young lady from the Jiugong family. Shou Chong is not a reliable person... If you invest in it, you will probably lose money." Jiang Xiaoche said truthfully.</p>

    <p>"I knew it. That's what they'd say."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun smiled.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is still young after all. The old man expected that his words had no weight.</p>

    <p>Although Huaguo Shuilian Group. He is the one who really controls the entire cake and holds the cake knife.</p>

    <p>However, he has to admit that this cake is not his alone after all.</p>

    <p>It is also important to consider the interests of other board members.</p>

    <p>"In my impression, Rongrong has never touched such a large amount of money." Boss Sun muttered while thinking.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, he felt that this was not the result of anger.</p>

    <p>If you use such a sum of money and end up losing money, you can imagine the consequences... The board of directors will definitely use this to make a fuss about her granddaughter's future control of the family business.</p>

    <p>His granddaughter is also being watched by countless people.</p>

    <p>Regarding the allocation of funds, he can decide on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <p>But whether she will be qualified to inherit the company in the future. That really depends on the girl's own ability...</p>

    <p>If you don't have enough ability.</p>

    <p>Then you can only entrust a third party to manage it.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun has been carefully cultivating Sun Rong over the years.</p>

    <p>Because Huaguo Shuilian Group was cultivated by him. After sowing, fertilizing, watering and the baptism of years, it has now grown into a towering tree full of fruits.</p>

    <p>The owner of this fruit tree, Mr. Boss Sun, does not want to transfer it to anyone else.</p>

    <p>"Sir, the board of directors is still waiting for a reply."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun said. He faced the video and smiled: "I have actually thought about it. I don't think Rongrong will do such an uncertain project."</p>

    <p>"But what if we lose money..."</p>

    <p>"Let's do it. You go back and tell the board of directors. I will sign a separate gambling agreement with all the board members."</p>

    <p>At this time, Mr. Boss Sun crossed his fingers, dragged his chin, and squinted his eyes slightly, looking at Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"Betting agreement?!" Jiang Xiaoche was shocked.</p>

    <p>"If Rongrong makes a profit from this investment, she will be the future heir of my Huaguo Shuilian Group. If it loses money, then according to the gambling agreement, I will choose a third party to act as agent."</p>

    <p>"This..." Jiang Xiaoche opened his mouth in surprise.</p>

    <p>I feel like this matter has caused a bit of a fuss.</p>

    <p>"Sir, are you sure you won't think about it anymore..." Jiang Xiaoche frowned.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoche. I know that there are many stocks and investments in the group. You didn't listen to my advice at all... instead you made money." Boss Sun showed a wry smile.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Sometimes, right and wrong are half-and-half records."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun smiled and said: "When I get older, even though I have made many wrong choices and assumptions, I still believe in Rongrong. I believe in my own decisions. I can always make it right the last time."</p>

    <p>"Master..." Jiang Xiaoche looked moved. There was still a bit of emotion in his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>It is so enviable to have such a grandpa...</p>

    <p>"Forget it. I'll go talk to the board of directors directly. Help me. Cut the video."</p>

    <p>At this time, Boss Sun's words interrupted Jiang Xiaoche's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Face the members of the board of directors.</p>

    <p>In addition to the contents of the previous gambling agreement.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun only had two words left: make money!</p>
