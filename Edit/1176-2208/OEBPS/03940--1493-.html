  <h1>Chapter 1493 The compatibility between Wang Ming and Zhai Yin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt that Zhuo Yi seemed a bit bold recently. However, he had never seen Zhuo Yi beg like this for someone.</p>

    <p>For a moment, a string in Wang Ling's heart was touched. But he couldn't tell what kind of emotion it was.</p>

    <p>He felt that he should be able to understand it. However, every time like this, Wang Ling felt as if his heart was being pinched tightly by an invisible big hand.</p>

    <p>That invisible hand was like a cage, crushing all his ups and downs of emotions into the turbulent but secret undercurrent in his heart...</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling often feels confused.</p>

    <p>However, in front of him, Zhuo Yi's request for Jiugong Liangzi seemed to touch him again. He could not refuse Zhuo Yi's request.</p>

    <p>Forget it. Just think of it as fulfilling the friendship between master and disciple...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually felt very complicated. But he still found a reason to agree to Zhuo Yi's request.</p>

    <p>This kind of giving up all your strength for the person you like...Wang Ling feels that this scene is a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>During the joint military training exercise of the six schools last semester, the old devil knelt down in front of General Yi for his wife.</p>

    <p>To this day. Wang Ling still remembers that scene.</p>

    <p>The scene at that time seemed to be engraved in his mind and he could not forget it.</p>

    <p>Maybe it will take a lot of time for him to truly understand such a move...but his road is still long. Who knows when he will understand?</p>

    <p>Maybe ten years? Maybe twenty years? Or maybe. Forever...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling smiled sadly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He reached out and rubbed the curly hair on Zhuo Yi's forehead. Zhuo Yi felt a warm current pouring into his head from the center of his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling seemed to give him a power, filling up the reservoir of {thirty-three small paths of vitality} in his body.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he told Zhuo Yi something. He hoped that Zhuo Yi would pay more attention to it while he was away from the country.</p>

    <p>"Master, have you agreed?" Zhuo Yi was overjoyed. Tears of excitement flowed down his face.</p>

    <p>In fact, he did not have the idea that Wang Ling would definitely agree to him at the beginning.</p>

    <p>After all, my own requirements conflict with the peaceful life that Master has always been passionate about.</p>

    <p>Going abroad to be an exchange student is really eye-catching...</p>

    <p>However, Zhuo Yi has actually thought of a remedy.</p>

    <p>This operation is a two-way communication operation between Number 60 High School and Sun Island. As long as other schools are not involved, temporarily blocking the news can still be done Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi left. Wang Ling was waiting in the bedroom for the man to appear...</p>

    <p>When the remote holographic projection appeared in the bedroom, Wang Ming's smiling face revealed in front of Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>The young man looked at Wang Ling's eyes. He couldn't help but smile: "I really didn't follow you on purpose this time. I really have something important to do."</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling and said, "Do you still remember the set of Silver Horn DNA that we investigated before?"</p>

    <p>"Teacher Guo Ping is now an expert in this field? Although no DNA comparison data can be found in the big database. However, he still judged that this Silver Horn man may be related to some aliens who illegally reside on the Earth on Sun Island."</p>

    <p>"His judgment is consistent with the result I obtained by intruding into the private database in private. Originally, this matter should have been handed over to Teacher Guo Ping. But it's hard to get away from it..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling looked at Wang Ming doubtfully.</p>

    <p>He knew this man too well...even if he didn't need to read his mind, he would know that there must be other reasons behind it.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I admit it. There are actually not many opportunities for this kind of public travel. I have been holding back in Huaxiu for too long. I just want to find an opportunity to go out and have fun."</p>

    <p>"What about Zhai Yin?" Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>"I definitely can't get rid of her...she will buy another ticket to follow." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha, who had been lying on the ground silently for a long time, lazily raised his eyelids and chuckled: "I think this girl should like you."</p>

    <p>"Be more confident. Remove the should. She just likes me." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha rolled his eyes: "You know that you still hang on to others?"</p>

    <p>"I'm doing this for her own good...and I think it's probably impossible for Yinzi and I..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed: "I used {brain deduction} to calculate the compatibility between me and her. The compatibility is really too low. There is only a very small probability. It is a happy ending together."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ming raised a finger.</p>

    <p>"You only have a 10% chance?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shook his head: "Number 0.10%."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's smile gradually disappeared: "Maybe I am not the one he is destined for... If Yinzi is with someone else, she may live a happier life."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the Sun Island exchange student plan was also sent to Jiugong's family at the same time. This was the internal communication between Jiugong Liangzi and Jiugong's family. The news was released in advance. This was also the plan formulated after discussion between Jiugong Liangzi and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High School is sending three students here, right? Liangzi?" The person who called Jiugong Liangzi was the exclusive foreign affairs liaison officer of the Jiugong family. Yingxian Heming.</p>

    <p>This is an old man with silver-white back hair. He is very tall and has a childlike face. There is not a single wrinkle on his face.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Uncle Ying. I will send you the information of the three people and the leader of the team later." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"No problem. Leave it to me. Don't worry, Miss Liangzi. I will definitely contact the best school closest to Jiugong's home to give our distinguished guests from afar the best experience."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming smiled: "Speaking of which, wouldn't Miss Liangzi take the opportunity to go home and take a look? The head of the family, the eldest master and the eldest wife all miss you."</p>

    <p>This sounded like a test. Jiugong Liangzi was silent. Then he replied with a smile: "I haven't completely established myself in Huaxiu country. So I can't come back for the time being. Please don't worry, grandpa and parents."</p>

    <p>"And I should be able to find out the whereabouts of that dead fish-eyed boy soon."</p>

    <p>"The fish-eyed boy? You mean the one who was witnessed by the Day-traveling ghost back then..."</p>

    <p>"Exactly." Jiugong Liangzi said: "I invested a huge sum of money in Master Shou Chong's research institute. I believe that soon he will be able to develop a tool that can successfully find the boy."</p>

    <p>On the phone, the girl was not there to report that she was safe at home. She also explained her various plans. However, she did not say that she had been poisoned by "the whole world is full of dead fish eyes"...</p>

    <p>The announcement was completed. After Jiugong Liangzi hung up the phone, he patted his flat chest and breathed a sigh of relief: "Finally everything is done..."</p>

    <p>At this time, she was still in the bedroom of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Are you still looking for that boy with dead fish eyes?" After listening to Jiugong Liangzi's words, Sun Rong asked, holding back a smile.</p>

    <p>"Yes! If it weren't for your medicine that makes me look at others with blind eyes... I might have found him long ago..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I think you should not be too attached to this. You might not be able to find it..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "No! I will definitely find him after you and your classmate Wang Ling go abroad!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>
