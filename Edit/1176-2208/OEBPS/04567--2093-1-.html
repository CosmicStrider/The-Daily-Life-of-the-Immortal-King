  <h1>Chapter 2093 Another Qiao Yanyuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The incident happened suddenly. There was no sign. A person fell directly out of the suddenly created space crack. Then, like a meteorite falling, it once again smashed the Ice Purgatory, the first map of the Sun family's ancestral land, to pieces.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal held his forehead with a headache and a sense of powerlessness. After all, repairing the Ice Purgatory was also the result of his hard work.</p>

    <p>It's really unforgivable!</p>

    <p>"Can actually fall here through multi-dimensional space. Who is this person?" Sun Ying'er is also extremely curious about this. As the Lord of the Void, her sensitivity to space can be imagined. The ancestral home of the Sun family is in Whales Within the belly. This is the world generated in the belly of the whale.</p>

    <p>If we use modern words to describe it, if the real world is a computer, then the ancient whale outside is a piece of software running on a huge computer.</p>

    <p>All map layouts in the ancestral land are program folders inside the software.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if this person came from external space, he should have fallen directly onto the system desktop. It is impossible for him to jump over many obstacles and fall directly here.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there is only one solution to this situation. That is that this person calculated everything and deliberately fell into this place.</p>

    <p>"Come out."</p>

    <p>The map that was finally repaired was destroyed again. Not to mention Boss Sun, whose blood pressure increased and collapsed again. Zhenyuan himself was equally annoyed.</p>

    <p>The red hair on his head stood on end. His whole body was filled with spiritual energy. This surprised Sun Rong. This person from Zhenyuan Immortal who was clearly on the border of Venerated Immortal a few months ago... has actually crossed over to the ancestral realm. territory.</p>

    <p>Nine-core Aohai and Sun Ying'er double verification. Both told Sun Rong. The current Zhenyuan immortal is at least in the Dao Ancestor realm. Maybe it is stronger than imagined.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that as a legendary Venerated Immortal. Zhenyuan Immortal is worthy of being a Zhenyuan Immortal. His strength is so powerful that it really makes people wonder.</p>

    <p>In fact, in order to attack the ancestral realm in one fell swoop, the Zhenyuan immortals had made plans thousands of years before they became Venerated Immortals. They are the same as the vast majority of earth powers who have sealed their realms in order to comply with the {International True Immortal Convention}. He After leaping into the realm of Venerated Immortal, he also sealed his spiritual power and energy.</p>

    <p>Back then, when no one else had touched this level, he became the first to try something new. In order to prevent himself from staying on Earth, he would destroy the balance of combat power among the major cultivating countries and lead to further involution.</p>

    <p>He left the earth on his own. It was nominally an interstellar travel in order to find a second star suitable for human habitation. But in fact, the people of Zhenyuan Immortal had a clear conscience.</p>

    <p>If he continues to stay on the earth, the other cultivator nations will inevitably be wary and suspicious of him. After all, looking at the history of cultivators around the world, only the Huaxiu nation has a long-standing civilization. Since ancient times, it has never relied on invading other cultivators to expand. own territory.</p>

    <p>With the exception of Huaxiu, all the large and medium-sized cultivating countries on earth today have more or less engaged in aggressive wars with foreign countries in the history of their founding.</p>

    <p>Only those who have invaded others will be afraid of a stronger opponent. Therefore, some cultivating countries have always imagined the increasingly powerful Huaxiu country as an enemy and engage in their own persecutory paranoia-style operations. Let's take a closer look. It's also very funny.</p>

    <p>All in all, Zhenyuan Immortal is the first legend in the modern history of cultivation to transcend the realm of True Immortal and successfully enter the realm of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he will have a longer time to store his spiritual power. In addition, Wang Ling has now built a mountain of retrospection in the Office of Strategic Deception. In a short period of time, he will attack the ancestral realm from Venerated Immortal. In fact. There is absolutely a theory that can be achieved.</p>

    <p>Because in terms of cultivation talent, Zhenyuan Immortal is a rare genius.</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>After Zhenyuan Immortal asked questions, deep in the white mist that was scattered in all directions by the hot explosion, a ragged figure walked out. One of this man's arms was wounded and bleeding.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his breath was weak. It seemed that he had traveled through space for a long time to get here, and it had consumed the last of his strength. But the moment they saw this person's face, the people in Zhenyuan Immortal were still surprised and immediately increased their vigilance.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was stunned.</p>

    <p>She quickly came back to her senses and told Sun Rong everything: "He is Qiao Yanyuan! Exactly the same! Wang Ying synchronized his appearance for me!"</p>

    <p>"Why is he here...and injured? Shouldn't he be in the restricted area?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned. She thought of the grudges Wang Ling had with Bai Zhe before Wang Ling helped her lift the Yin-Yang Death Curse.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he knew it. In order to avoid future troubles, Wang Ling directly erased all the existence of Bai Zhe in the universe.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this person's obsession with Wang Ling was too deep and his resentment was too strong. Instead, he became a negatively distorted product of the will of the universe. He was able to survive with the help of a very small part of the will of the universe.</p>

    <p>So now that Wang Ling's action has been confirmed. There is the possibility of parallel space. Then could this Qiao Yanyuan be Qiao Yanyuan from another world...</p>

    <p>Soon. Sun Rong's bold hypothesis was verified.</p>

    <p>She saw this different Qiao Yanyuan. He staggered out of the ice mist. The blood on his arms was frozen by the temperature of ice purgatory. His body was very weak. He seemed to be about to fall at any time. Although he had a long Zhang and Qiao Yanyuan's faces are almost carved from the same mold.</p>

    <p>But after careful analysis, Sun Rong can still feel the obvious difference. His complexion is not as full as that of Dragonborn Qiao Yanyuan. His cheeks are sunken, his eye sockets are deeper, and he has heavy dark circles. It seems like he has stayed up late for a long time. A state of being squeezed dry after a long period of time.</p>

    <p>No one took action. Instead, they looked at this sudden uninvited guest with caution. As they watched him walk, they muttered: "This is it...it can't be wrong...the first one to see it" Someone can help me escape from the sea of suffering..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, his lips were still trembling. They were all white, without a trace of blood. If he hadn't seen the mighty Dragonborn Qiao Yanyuan over there, it would be hard to imagine that Qiao Yanyuan in the other dimensions would be so down and out. appearance.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong also noticed that Qiao Yanyuan's eyes seemed to have been locked on him.</p>

    <p>Walking step by step in her direction...</p>

    <p>Although the voice of Qiao Yanyuan's mutterings was very subtle, everyone in Zhenyuan Immortal could hear it clearly.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know what happened specifically. www.uukanshu.net But it's obvious that Qiao Yanyuan came here to find someone. And he is now keeping an eye on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"In other words, Miss Rong is the savior in his mouth?" Zhenyuan Immortal looked confused.</p>

    <p>However, it only took him a few seconds to reach this conclusion. Slaps in the face followed one after another.</p>

    <p>I saw this miserable Qiao Yanyuan walking straight in front of Sun Rong. He knelt down directly towards her with a thud.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had never received such a compliment. She looked at Qiao Yanyuan in front of her in such a state of desolation. Subconsciously, her kind thoughts made her want to help him up.</p>

    <p>As a result, before he could even start, he saw Qiao Yanyuan kowtow to the ground again: "Head of the Sun family! Mr. Sun Yiyuan! Please pay your respects to me, Qiao!"</p>

    <p>No one expected that the person he was targeting from the beginning was not Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Instead, he was being supported by Sun Rong. Boss Sun, who was still in a coma...</p>
