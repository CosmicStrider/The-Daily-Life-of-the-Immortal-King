  <h1>Chapter 1772 Sun Rong was attacked</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the way to Glio City. Sun Rong is sitting on her private immortal boat. Traveling along the specially approved green route.</p>

    <p>She has planned everything on the immortal boat. While discussing how to spend a beautiful and fulfilling day with Wang Ling, she will not cause Wang Ling to resent her because she is too proactive.</p>

    <p>In the past, when facing this kind of situation, Sun Rong would always take the initiative to find a few acquaintances to go with her. For example, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Li Youyue... these are regular members of the team. They have a keen eye and know how to get on. The most important thing is that he will also provide assists.</p>

    <p>This trip abroad was actually a bit troublesome. She felt that Chen Chao and others might not be willing to go with her. But she didn't expect that when she asked in the group, these people actually agreed.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked on the spot: "Are you even willing to go abroad?"</p>

    <p>"Is it the same as before? Round-trip air tickets, food and accommodation are included." Guo Hao posted an emoticon of giving roses.</p>

    <p>"Of course...I invited you. I should pay for it." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"That's okay." Chen Chao answered, "And Glio City. Chao'er and I have wanted to go there. It's a technological paradise for modern cultivation games! Although the schedule seems a bit tight, as long as we have this. Don't worry about your affairs with Wang Ling. Just leave it to us!"</p>

    <p>Perhaps she was infected by Chen Chao's impassioned statement. Sun Rong was also excited to hear it.</p>

    <p>However, because she was already checking in when she made the invitation, Sun Rong spent a lot of money and chartered another immortal boat for the three of them. It was expected to arrive in Glio City one hour later than her.</p>

    <p>Sure enough...</p>

    <p>It still wouldn't work without the help of her friends.</p>

    <p>It's like buying a drink for a boy you like. In order to make yourself less obvious, you usually buy several bottles and distribute them to the boy you want to give them to and the people around the boy. This way it won't look too obvious.</p>

    <p>"Miss, we'll be there in three hours." On the immortal boat, Butler Lin stood by the side respectfully.</p>

    <p>He was sent by Boss Sun specifically to protect the safety of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But to be honest. Now Sun Rong feels that it's really unclear who protects whose safety.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Butler Lin is also an elder in the family who has watched her grow up. In terms of seniority, he is even higher than the first-level elders of the group. He followed the entrepreneurial journey with Mr. Boss Sun back then and held original shares.</p>

    <p>Although the proportion is not large, Butler Lin still has billions of assets.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knew that it was grandpa's wish for Butler Lin to follow her. In order to reassure the elderly, she naturally could not refuse. She could only agree.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin, don't stand next to me all the time. Otherwise, lie down and rest?" Sun Rong asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"How can that be done? It's my duty to protect the young lady. Besides, we received a lot of threatening letters a while ago... The safety of the young lady is also the main concern of the master."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said: "If this is like the first few times, if you ignore these threats, it is very likely to attract a group of extremely vicious people like Shadow Liu."</p>

    <p>"But now the entire shadow stream has been taken away."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>In fact, since Shadow Stream disappeared, there are actually many mercenary organizations targeting her. However, their comprehensive business capabilities are obviously not as strong as Shadow Stream...</p>

    <p>They go after the wrong person every time. It gives Sun Rong a headache.</p>

    <p>The realm is indeed higher than the shadow stream, but IQ does not seem to go straight down the line, according to the realm of high cultivators like fancy flying in the sky, feet off the ground, smart IQ and re-occupy the high ground ... But now she ran into these mercenaries, one by one, all seem to be cerebral hemorrhage.</p>

    <p>So every time at this time, Sun Rong misses the days when Liuyue attempted to assassinated her. Sun Rong wonders how the Liuyue sisters are doing in prison...</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about, miss?" Butler Lin looked at Sun Rong with a thoughtful expression on his face.</p>

    <p>She couldn't help but say. "No... I just thought of two old friends..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong rubbed her eyebrows and said, "Uncle Lin. Do you still remember the Liuyue sisters who were captured half a year ago?"</p>

    <p>"So the young lady is thinking about their affairs?" Butler Lin said calmly: "These killers are never worthy of tolerance for their disregard of human life. The young lady does not need to blame herself or even forgive them."</p>

    <p>"I don't want to forgive them."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook her head and said: "I just suddenly felt that the appearance of this group of people has made me grow a lot. From the perspective of opponents, I think the quality of these sisters is quite high."</p>

    <p>"What the lady said is..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said: "They are currently being held in a women's prison. It is said that they are doing well at the moment. But it will be a hundred years before they are released from prison after serving their sentences."</p>

    <p>"Is the sentence been that long?"</p>

    <p>"Not as long as the mahjong team in Songhai City Number 1 Prison. If they are reformed well, there is still a possibility of a reduced sentence."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, she really wanted to find a chance to see the two Liuyue sisters. Because she had always had a very curious question. Who was the person behind the scenes who hired Liuyue to assassinate her.</p>

    <p>However, due to professionalism, she heard that Jiang Liuying and Jiang Liuyue have not betrayed their clients until now. It is for this reason that the two were finally sentenced to a heavier punishment. Otherwise, one of them would not have been imprisoned for a hundred years.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong was thinking with her chin upright. Suddenly, she felt a strong murderous aura permeating from high in the sky.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise. A psychic missile launched from nowhere accurately hit the spiritual barrier of the immortal boat on which Sun Rong was riding.</p>

    <p>Under attack!</p>

    <p>Someone is shooting at her with a missile!</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the psychic barrier that had been deployed on the outer layer of the immortal boat, the power of this missile was enough to cause the immortal boat to crash on the spot.</p>

    <p>This was obviously not a mistake. It was an attack that had been planned for a long time.</p>

    <p>The other party came prepared.</p>

    <p>But inside the immortal boat, everyone acted very calmly.</p>

    <p>Including the captain of the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>All members are elite employees of the group carefully selected by Sun Yiyuan. They all have very strong psychological quality and response ability to deal with unexpected risks.</p>

    <p>When the immortal boat was attacked, the captain quickly contacted the tower to report the situation and tried to land at a nearby anchorage of the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>"No need to land. Go directly to Glio City." At this time, Sun Rong turns on the voice call button. Communicate directly with the captain.</p>

    <p>"Miss...this will be dangerous! The other party's targeting is obvious..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Uncle Lin. In fact, my master...had expected it a long time ago. So she gave me a personal magic weapon to help me deal with this danger."</p>

    <p>"Miss's master? When did Miss have a master?"</p>

    <p>"It's the legendary elder named Wang Piaoliang in the Office of Strategic Deception. She accepted classmate Jiang Yingying as her disciple before."</p>

    <p>"It turns out it's her...the beautiful lady that classmate Jiang mentioned?" Butler Lin was shocked: "Why didn't the lady say anything about this in the first place?"</p>

    <p>"My master likes to keep a low profile...so she asked me not to mention her identity to the outside world."</p>

    <p>"So it is."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin nodded.</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the second shell came one after another from the flank.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Without saying a word, she directly used the cover of "Wang Piaoliang" to release Aohai's disguised sword energy in public!</p>

    <p>The moment the crimson sword energy seeped out of the immortal boat, an astonishing amount of spiritual pressure immediately followed. With the immortal boat as the center, it began to track the direction of the missile launch in all directions. From an extremely long distance, the responsible person lurked in the dark. The missile-launching Tengu whistle picked up the missile as accurately as if it were picking up a chicken...</p>

    <p>She is blessed with the power of nine-core Aohai.</p>

    <p>Not to mention missiles.</p>

    <p>Even a nuclear bomb can't hurt her...</p>
