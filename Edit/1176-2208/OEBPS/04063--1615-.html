  <h1>Chapter 1615 Jiang Yingying's War Letter</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Finding bugs is not Wang Ling's specialty. Since Shou Chong is confident enough to move this system to Number 60 High School for testing, there should be no special problems with the test system itself.</p>

    <p>Although this system is currently only under internal testing for Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>But if we want to promote it nationwide in the future.</p>

    <p>The carrying capacity and endurance of the system are both issues that need to be considered.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, we just need stability.</p>

    <p>So as long as this system is unstable.</p>

    <p>Then the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance will not consider the system developed by Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>In other words. In fact, Wang Ling does not need to find BUG at all.</p>

    <p>Just let the system reflect instability factors.</p>

    <p>As a weak young man who has always been dubbed the "mascot."</p>

    <p>Until now, many people think that Wang Ling was related to luck.</p>

    <p>This resulted in bugs appearing in the test results.</p>

    <p>Although in the end he was assigned to the elite class.</p>

    <p>This half year also represents the elite class going out to compete for glory for the school.</p>

    <p>However, it is still difficult to dispel some people's dissatisfaction with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So the test results of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School Many people now simply don't believe it.</p>

    <p>Even if he plays a little better, there doesn't seem to be any problem.</p>

    <p>And with the help of Gray Cult believers, the overall risk is very small.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling idea in his head right now is not looking for bugs at all.</p>

    <p>He decided to "break" Shou Chong's testing system. That would be enough.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it was an internal test at Number 60 High School. There were many people covering him.</p>

    <p>Even if he performs beyond his level.</p>

    <p>In the end, the problem will be attributed to the instability of the testing system mechanism and good luck...</p>

    <p>In essence, this is also related to the psychological shortcomings of some people.</p>

    <p>They would rather believe that it is good luck than believe that someone else is strong.</p>

    <p>Recognizing a person's excellence is important to these people.</p>

    <p>It's really difficult.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan doesn't like Shou Chong because of Shou Chong's shady past.</p>

    <p>No one else knows about this.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is clear in his heart.</p>

    <p>It's not like he deliberately eavesdropped on Teacher Pan's thoughts.</p>

    <p>But Teacher Pan kept chattering in his mind when he sent out the notice.</p>

    <p>There does seem to be deep hatred.</p>

    <p>Of course. Some people hate it. Of course, there are also supporters.</p>

    <p>As a current Internet celebrity, Shou Chong also has many fans in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>There are fans of his among students and teachers.</p>

    <p>These people are collectively known as "Morichui."</p>

    <p>I heard that this test system was developed by Shou Chong. Naturally, Mochuui and the others would not let this opportunity pass by.</p>

    <p>He began to forward the nonsense inventions that Shou Chong had previously announced on the Internet in the school forum group and post bar.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Wang Ling looks particularly calm.</p>

    <p>He has no interest in Internet celebrities themselves.</p>

    <p>And he also felt very bored about these inventions of Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>After all, there is a man much stronger than Shou Chong right next to him.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Shou Chong himself didn't think of it.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ming returned home from Sun Island, he had already been monitored by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>For example, Wang Ling now sees a series of messages sent to him by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High School. Did he really think that he was the one who drew Number 60 High School to serve as a test site for him through a relationship?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it was specially arranged by me."</p>

    <p>"And he was the mastermind of the animalization incident. It's absolutely correct. I calculated based on the coordinates and finally located it in his underground laboratory."</p>

    <p>"I think so. I'm afraid the reason why he did this is related to his next experiment."</p>

    <p>"Of course. The reason why I know so much information is not just because of the investigation here."</p>

    <p>"Mainly because."</p>

    <p>"He has people from Gray Cult on his team."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned when he saw the last message sent by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>His Gray Cult size...</p>

    <p>Has it expanded to this point?</p>

    <p>It's actually a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>If there are people from Gray Cult around Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>And he also knows so much information.</p>

    <p>Then it is extremely likely that he is an assistant level person next to Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming's words gave Wang Ling some reassurance.</p>

    <p>Because things have progressed to this point, wooing Shou Chong is like grabbing something from a bag.</p>

    <p>Next, just wait for Shou Chong to fall into the hole he dug.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Regarding Wang Ming's subsequent deployment plans for Shou Chong. In addition to Wang Ling, he also notified Sun Rong at the same time.</p>

    <p>The girl is thoughtful and thorough in everything she does. Wang Ming is actually quite relieved to leave the matter to Sun Rong with full authority.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, don't worry. Ling Ling's matters are my business." Sun Rong hung up the phone at the Student Union Office.</p>

    <p>In order to avoid the call being monitored, Wang Ming specially used a landline phone when contacting Sun Rong. The call can be connected remotely through brain waves.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ming's current brainwave radiation power, it is not that difficult to cover a city.</p>

    <p>If paired with a helmet that enhances the radiation range, Wang Ming's brain waves can be radiated to every corner of the world.</p>

    <p>But the shortcomings are also obvious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming can't last much time at the moment.</p>

    <p>This kind of behavior radiates the whole world. It takes less than five minutes to find a way to cool down the brain.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Zhai Yin will definitely use it to fry steak.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, little Rongrong." Wang Ming bared his teeth and smiled. His brain waves were immediately interrupted.</p>

    <p>And at the same moment Sun Rong put down the phone, the door of the student union office was breached by a beautiful figure.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang... the president is on the phone. You can't go in." The assistant secretary of the student union tried to stop him, but in the end he couldn't stop Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Just let her in. Close the door." Sun Rong was sitting in the chair of the student union president. He was smiling. His down-to-earth and generous attitude was in sharp contrast to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>After the door of the student union was completely closed, she just crossed her fingers and looked at Jiang Yingying in front of her with her chin: "Classmate Jiang, it's better not to be too angry. You just changed back from carp. If you are emotionally unstable, you will change again." It won't be easy if we go back."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was obviously frightened by Sun Rong</p>

    <p>She didn't know that this matter had something to do with emotions.</p>

    <p>After taking a few deep breaths, she gritted her teeth and looked at Sun Rong: "Stop scaring me..."</p>

    <p>"I didn't scare you." Sun Rong spread his hands with a look of disbelief.</p>

    <p>No matter what happens, go to the Three Treasures Hall.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong In fact, you can probably guess why Jiang Yingying came to see him.</p>

    <p>After all, she felt that she had underestimated Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that she would be so persistent towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong. This time the school introduces a testing system. I think it is a good opportunity!" At this time, Jiang Yingying held the table with both hands and said while looking at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"What chance?"</p>

    <p>"Don't act stupid... you obviously know it!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying said: "Let's compare! Test scores! If I'm higher than you! Give me the seat next to Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>The expression on Sun Rong's face was unwavering. On the contrary, I thought Jiang Yingying was a little cute: "Then what if you lose? I have to get something, right?"</p>

    <p>"If I lose... I'll... I'll..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying thought for a moment. She felt that she had nothing to gamble with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Money...</p>

    <p>The girl definitely doesn't care.</p>

    <p>Magic weapon...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is not lacking either.</p>

    <p>Just raise your arms and buy whatever you want.</p>

    <p>So Jiang Yingying gritted his teeth and said, "If I lose, I will go back to my old high school and disappear before your eyes!"</p>
