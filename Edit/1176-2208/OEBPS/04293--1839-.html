  <h1>Chapter 1839 The fastidious female Taoist priest</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Speaking of which, the bad relationship between Wang Ling and You Yueqing started a long time ago. A long time ago... You Yueqing was Wang Ling's kindergarten classmate.</p>

    <p>That was a long time ago. When they were children, parents always liked to jokingly ask their children how many husbands and wives they had in kindergarten. Even during the kindergarten period of Wang Ling, Unavoidable vulgarity.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was once one of the people teased by Father Wang, Mother Wang and Mr. Wang.</p>

    <p>When she was in elementary school, You Yueqing even kept in touch with Wang Ling. Sometimes she even took the initiative to come to the Wang family's small villa as a guest.</p>

    <p>Later, Father Wang and Mother Wang heard that You Yueqing had moved to another city. The relationship between the two families became indifferent.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Ling was admitted to junior high school. He heard about You Yueqing's current situation from one of his junior high school classmates... He said that You Yueqing made a bold decision when she was admitted to junior high school - Become a Taoist priest!</p>

    <p>After hearing the news, Wang Ling's expression was obviously a little confused. He knew that You Yueqing's brain circuit had always been abnormal. But he didn't expect it to be so abnormal... but soon. Wang Ling's calm was restored.</p>

    <p>However, You Yueqing's knowledge of Wang Ling himself is limited. She does not know that Wang Ling has heaven-defying abilities. She just intuitively feels that it is better than ordinary cultivators.</p>

    <p>She has felt an attraction to Wang Ling  since she was a child.</p>

    <p>After coming to Fenglei Village to become the senior sister, she happened to meet Wang Ling, as a female Taoist priest.</p>

    <p>For example, in the year when grandma Wang Ling passed away, You Yueqing hosted the Dharma conference for grandma Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At that time, she was not as mature as she is now. Her childish face was full of the look of a cute porcelain doll. However, when she was presiding over the Dharma conference, her face was tight and unusually serious.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that You Yueqing is a female Taoist priest with extremely strong professional abilities.</p>

    <p>Entering the dojo. You Yueqing led Wang Ling and Sun Rong to sit down on the futon.</p>

    <p>This was originally the teaching hall of Fenglei Village. Tables made of peach wood were neatly placed in front of the hall. There was a simple futon in front of each table.</p>

    <p>At the front of the main hall are an offering table and an incense burner. There is also a huge Bagua disk hanging on the wall in the front.</p>

    <p>The futon in front of the altar table looks slightly larger than the futon used by ordinary disciples. It is also black and white in Tai Chi color.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, the owners of Fenglei Village and You Yueqing give lectures here.</p>

    <p>Of course. The owner of Fenglei Village is a lazy man. The main lecture is You Yueqing preaching in the lecture hall as the senior sister.</p>

    <p>Compared with other Taoist temples, the characteristic of Fenglei Village is that the people here are all young Taoists.</p>

    <p>After pouring tea for the two of them, You Yueqing also heard Sun Rong talk about her demands.</p>

    <p>She didn't answer the question immediately. She just smiled at Sun Rong first. Then she asked in a very low voice: "Mum, maybe it's a bit rude. But I'm curious... between you and layman Wang." What kind of relationship is it?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately said, "It's just a classmate relationship..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing showed an expression of sudden realization. Immediately she became happy: "In my impression, layman Wang almost never talks to girls. The probability of traveling together is very low."</p>

    <p>"So Taoist priests are also interested in secular things..." Sun Rong asked with sweat on her cheeks.</p>

    <p>"They are just Taoist priests. They are not monks. Taoist priests can be divided into those who are particular and those who are not. They do not have many restrictions on emotional matters. Those who are more particular can get married after finding true love." You Yueqing said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Get... get married..."</p>

    <p>"Of course you can get married. You can return to secular life. I just wanted to wait for Wang Ling. That's why I became a Taoist priest. If he figures it out sometime, I can return to secular life at any time." You Yueqing said in front of Sun Rong said straightforwardly. This overflowing confidence instantly gave Sun Rong a great sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling was also choked by You Yueqing's words.</p>

    <p>He confirmed that You Yueqing's words were definitely intentional.</p>

    <p>It's not that she say it to Sun Rong. It's that she says it to him.</p>

    <p>When he was very young, he remembered that You Yueqing liked to tease him more than other the girls.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that he was regarded as a silent monster and isolated in the eyes of others. In the end, You Yueqing still persisted in making all kinds of jokes with him.</p>

    <p>The speaker has no intention. The listener has intention.</p>

    <p>These words made Sun Rong put down all the vigilance before entering the Taoist temple and instantly increased it!</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>She thinks too much!</p>

    <p>It turns out that female Taoist priests are the most dangerous!</p>

    <p>Pretending to be a Taoist priest, are you actually playing hard to get?</p>

    <p>Danger!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels this is a huge crisis.</p>

    <p>It was completely different from the feeling she had when facing Jiang Yingying before. She was sure that Jiang Yingying was no match for her, so she had always been calm.</p>

    <p>But facing You Yueqing, she didn't know anything. She felt like she didn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>As for the story between You Yueqing and Wang Ling. Sun Rong also had no idea at all. What kind of past there was between the two people... She was really curious.</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was thinking wildly, You Yueqing shook off the pink dust on her hand and suddenly changed the topic back to the main topic.</p>

    <p>In Sun Rong's opinion, this is a very clever method.</p>

    <p>Not giving her any chance to ask questions about her past relationship with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>She looked at the photo and identified it for herself. Then she nodded and said.</p>

    <p>"The female lay practitioner you mentioned did come to Fenglei Village a while ago to come to me for divination."</p>

    <p>"And because the prediction she asked me to make was very strange, I remember it very clearly."</p>

    <p>"Strange prediction?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. It's a very strange question." You Yueqing said slightly: "Logically speaking, this is a client's secret. I shouldn't have told you originally. But from now on, it seems that this female lay practitioner may have been in danger. So... requires something special."</p>

    <p>She looked at Sun Rong and Wang Ling seriously. She said, "What she wants me to calculate is about the job interview. It's very strange. She is obviously a girl who looks about the same age as us. At such a young age, she gave up the path of studying and went to work. At this age, the only way out is to study. Studying hard is better than anything else. Instead of finding a place to work."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong suddenly felt that You Yueqing did not seem qualified to say these words.</p>

    <p>But You Yueqing didn't seem to notice anything wrong with what she said. Instead, she continued: "By the way, the results of my prediction at that time were not very good, so I gave her some advice. Still don't go for a job. Even if you pass the interview, don't go."</p>

    <p>At this time, You Yueqing sighed: "Hey, it seems that she thought I was too young and didn't believe me at all. So she probably went to that work unit and something happened."</p>

    <p>"Your predictions are so accurate?" Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>"It's definitely accurate."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing laughed. She took out a palm-sized turtle shell from the storage bag on the lapel of her Taoist robe: "This was given to me by Lay Practitioner Wang when I was very young. There is proof of our love in it. So it counts. The prediction is definitely accurate."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
