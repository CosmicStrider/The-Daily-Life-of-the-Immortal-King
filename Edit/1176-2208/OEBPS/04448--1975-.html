  <h1>Chapter 1975 Completely Darkened</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's really a swordsmanship that comes from heaven..."</p>

    <p>At the same moment, Jing Heqiu once again compared the accurate data about the "Huitian Sword Technique." This is a technique that uses the sword energy of the spiritual sword to wrap itself up to form a shield. All the fired spells and hidden weapons adapt to the whirling sword energy. All the sword skills bounced back.</p>

    <p>This is one of the secret arts that Yi Jianchuan learned before he became famous. It has extremely high requirements for the precise operation of sword energy. Even among those who have a tenth-level swordsmanship registration certificate, few people can do it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Teng Luchen was sure of one thing at that moment. That is, unless this matter was personally passed down by Sword Master Yi Jianchuan... it would be impossible to achieve exactly the same data.</p>

    <p>He was extremely pleasantly surprised. He was a young monk with a tenth level of fog skills. He was also a person with a tenth level of swordsmanship!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe. How many more surprises can it bring him?</p>

    <p>Such a magical discovery made Teng Luchen completely forget about testing Wang Ling for a brief moment... It can be said that Li Changzhe is the genius he has been looking for!</p>

    <p>He's only less than 20 years old. He's still a high school student... Not only has his level reached the early stage of Golden Core, but he's also supervising the practice of fog and swordsmanship and has reached the tenth level!</p>

    <p>Even Qu Shuling, who is recognized as the strongest in the world, does not have such an ability!</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that before this trial in the spiritual world, Li Changzhe did not reveal his true strength at all.</p>

    <p>"What a low-key kid." Teng Luchen lamented in his heart that Li Changzhe had hidden so much. He was quite moved by his unobtrusive approach.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mr. Teng. Even I... was a little touched."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu secretly wiped away tears and said: "Classmate Li is so low-key. He seems to be quite popular. You see, he also wants to help Qu Shuling repair the spirit sword. And judging from the accuracy of the repair, Classmate Li should know a master who has reached at least the tenth level of weapon refining. Our harvest this time is really great."</p>

    <p>"Nice."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen repeatedly lamented: "Not only does his cultivation surpass those of his peers, but he also possesses many full-level specialties. He had been living a low-key life before. And in this low-key life, he was able to maintain his friendship... This child's discovery. It is indeed a surprise for me. Not only his cultivation, but also his moral character."</p>

    <p>Such continuous compliments stunned Jing Heqiu. He had never heard Teng Luchen look so satisfied with a person. He even did not hesitate to praise him with effusive words.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jing Heqiu also heard that there was something in Teng Luchen's words.</p>

    <p>If we want to talk about why Li Changzhe's actions in all aspects are particularly touching under this situation, the support of his peers is often also very crucial.</p>

    <p>What Qu Shuling did this time really frustrated many people.</p>

    <p>The content of the trial in the spirit world is confidential, all the data in it, including the video data, will not be leaked. Even so, no one would have thought that Qu Shuling would reveal his true self under such circumstances.</p>

    <p>Take the matter of repairing the spiritual sword as an example. It was clear that Zhanye had completed the repair, but he chose to directly abandon the connection with Zhanye, sever the contract, and also tried to take revenge.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Qu Shuling's murderous intention was so serious." Jing Heqiu whispered to the side. He is a smart man. After knowing this trial in the spirit world, Shangfeng will definitely adjust his strategic tilt towards Qu Shuling. and attitude.</p>

    <p>Although the current situation does not seem to be complete enough to abandon Qu Shuling, Jing Heqiu, who is responsible for the specific implementation of this adjustment of Qu Shuling's overall strategic attitude, still has to test Shangfeng's intentions first.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Teng Luchen's attitude became very crucial.</p>

    <p>What he said this time was actually a temptation.</p>

    <p>They saw that Teng Luchen's original excited expression gradually dimmed. His white eyebrows were furrowed. After a long time, he answered: "I leave all the decisions regarding Qu Shuling to you."</p>

    <p>Disposal opinions...</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was shocked.</p>

    <p>He thought that Shangfeng had not completely given up on Qu Shuling. But now these words made his attitude very clear.</p>

    <p>What does disposal mean?</p>

    <p>What kind of people need to be dealt with?</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, only those who have made serious mistakes and have major moral flaws will use the word disposal to describe the strategic resource adjustment within Jiutian Jingmi Hospital.</p>

    <p>In other words, he is ready to cut ties with Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Even Shengke may be affected by Qu Shuling's relationship and directly lose his qualifications for the big list of the Earth Center Project.</p>

    <p>This is a big event. Once word spreads, it will definitely stir up a huge pressure...</p>

    <p>Even Jing Heqiu was a little dumbfounded. He never expected that Teng Luchen would give up so decisively.</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao... can you give him another chance... Young people always make mistakes when doing things." He asked secretly.</p>

    <p>"I only believe what I see."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen said leisurely: "Moreover, I have given him the greatest dignity..."</p>

    <p>That's all. Jing Heqiu completely understood what Teng Luchen meant.</p>

    <p>Activate the sacred-level spiritual sword. Exploit loopholes in the protection mechanism system of the spiritual world and harm other people. For this alone, it is not an exaggeration to send Qu Shuling directly to the Xiuzhen Police Station for legal punishment.</p>

    <p>But the good thing is...</p>

    <p>Now in the battle situation, although Qu Shuling confidently activated his sacred weapon Yueli, he didn't seem to get any advantage.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"What kind of swordsmanship is this..."</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Li Changzhe, who was in the center of the battle and had been imagined by the leaders under surveillance from the outside world to be Qu Shuling, was the focus of attention and a genius with both good character and outstanding moral integrity. He had no idea that two masters were already crying for him in front of the monitor.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his face showed a confused face. He had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>He stared in astonishment at Zhanye in his hand and Qu Shuling in front of him who was struggling to block the backlash of the Thunder Moon Sword. His eyes were blank.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was an illusion. He felt that the Zhanye in his hand... seemed to have become a spirit!</p>

    <p>This sword seems to have a mind of its own!</p>

    <p>It will move with his body!</p>

    <p>He didn't even know how he performed the sword technique just now. He just performed it naturally.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you always bad at swordsmanship?"</p>

    <p>At this time, facing Zhang Linyan's questioning, Li Changzhe could not argue: "No, Sister Zhang...that's not the case."</p>

    <p>"What the hell! You blocked the attack of the holy weapon level spirit sword! And it bounced back! Why are you so skilled!"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was watching a show on the side. The quarrel between the two had a flirtatious flavor. It was quite enjoyable to watch.</p>

    <p>However, in the eyes of some people, this scene becomes a bit too Versailles and dazzling.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling, who was in a difficult spot and had rebounded from the swordsmanship of Zhanye, was almost distorted in his mind at this time.</p>

    <p>It was just a sword that he had abandoned... it could actually block the holy weapon in his hand! This was something he could not accept no matter what.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, Li Changzhe's nerves were almost stretched to the extreme.</p>

    <p>Although he was not sure what happened specifically and what was the condition of the repaired Zhanye.</p>

    <p>But now the powerful murderous aura seeping out of Qu Shuling had made him feel as cold as falling into an ice cave.</p>

    <p>"This is completely dark..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe felt bitter in his heart. He didn't expect that Qu Shuling's nature would be so terrifying after he was completely liberated.</p>
