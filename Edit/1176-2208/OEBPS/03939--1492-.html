  <h1>Chapter 1492 Wang Ling is going abroad?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Let Sun Rong pretend to be himself. Return to Sun Island to solve the family's internal problems.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is really not sure whether Sun Rong will agree to this matter.</p>

    <p>When everyone in the Jiugong family thought she was still studying in Huaxiu, the fake Jiugong who played her suddenly appeared in the family. It would definitely cause chaos for those in the family who were hiding in secret and plotting evil.</p>

    <p>And this trick of "transformation" was what Jiugong Liangzi had planned from the beginning.</p>

    <p>She originally knew that someone within the family was trying to take action against her, so she made a plan in advance.</p>

    <p>This trick is easy to lure the snake out of its hole.</p>

    <p>It's just that Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect that the people in the clan would be so eager to attack her, which made the whole plan have to be carried out in advance.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan, Jiugong Liangzi planned to let Junko play himself. But unfortunately, the plan could not keep up with the changes...</p>

    <p>For things to develop to this point, it is obviously not what Jiugong Liangzi wants to see.</p>

    <p>Human nature is complex. More complex than the ghosts recorded in {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>After listening to Jiugong Liangzi tell the whole story about what he knew, Sun Rong nodded slightly: "So, classmate Liangzi, you have noticed that there is something wrong with the female bodyguard named Junko Zhongchun, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." The expression on Jiugong Liangzi's face was slightly melancholy: "But I only learned the exact information after coming to Huaxiu country. So I asked Junko to pretend to be me and return to Jiugong's house to lure the snake out of the hole. Now I can only choose another candidate."</p>

    <p>"Why would she betray you?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe it's because he was threatened. What I know is that Junko has a sister who is not related by blood."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "Her sister should have been kidnapped. Judging from the method, it is a bit like the method of Mrs. Six. Mrs. Six's family was originally a famous underworld family on Sun Island. But there is no conclusive evidence yet."</p>

    <p>"Need help?"</p>

    <p>"No. In fact, Junko's sister has been successfully rescued by us secretly." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"Since you knew there was something wrong with Miss Junko, why did you send her to the hotel to keep an eye on her?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiugong Liangzi frowned slightly: "Junko has watched me grow up. She is like my sister. She is indeed the person I trust most. She really wants to kill me. In fact, she has many opportunities. But Sister Junko never made a move..."</p>

    <p>"So. You still believe her?"</p>

    <p>"Will the witness protection plan be leaked? This is the final test."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said: "The other party is still hiding the fact that Junko's sister has been rescued. They plan to use this to continue to coerce Junko."</p>

    <p>"Won't be discovered?"</p>

    <p>"Just use those pre-recorded videos. If you change the time a little, Junko will still be kept in the dark unless we reveal the truth..."</p>

    <p>"Last question."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong sighed slightly and said: "According to the original plan, Junko will disguise himself as you. Then Junko will disappear. In order to avoid suspicion, do you still have to find someone to pretend to be Junko?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. There are actually people who can pretend to be Junko. But Zhuo Yi just suggested that I change..."</p>

    <p>"Substitution? Who?"</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng... Zhuo Yi told me. You also know this senior."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"He said that Jin Deng-senpai has more experience playing the role of a woman in order to understand the sufferings of the world. And if Jin Deng-senpai is accompanying you, your safety will be guaranteed."</p>

    <p>In fact, when Jiugong Liangzi learned that the monk had been a "women's clothing boss", his young heart also collapsed.</p>

    <p>Senior Jin Deng... this is one of the seniors she admires most in her life!</p>

    <p>Who knew that such a tall and majestic image would be destroyed by Zhuo Yi's words...</p>

    <p>That's the whole story of the incident. We don't know yet whether Jiugong's plan can be implemented smoothly. Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But the monk disguised himself as Junko and stayed with her. Just thinking about that scene is very "beautiful."</p>

    <p>As for the Jiugong family, Sun Rong has the blessing of Aohai's combat power after all. There is nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>But now, she is even more afraid of laughing...</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong could not help but sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>Seniors like Jin are so generous!</p>

    <p>For the descendants of old friends of the Jiugong family, he actually sacrificed himself to this extent.</p>

    <p>He is worthy of being the sage of Buddhism who has seen through the mortal world. The strongest sage on earth...</p>

    <p>Such seniors have achieved this level.</p>

    <p>So what reason does she have for refusing?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong had already figured out the matter of agreeing to Jiugong Liangzi's request as early as when Zhuo Yi sent her a text message to beg her.</p>

    <p>Because from the overall assessment, Jiugong Liangzi is an object that can be developed.</p>

    <p>If I can win him over and become one of my own, I won't have to worry about her investigating Wang Ling in the future.</p>

    <p>I helped Jiugong Liangzi. It not only solved the worries of my classmate Wang Ling. It also solved my own worries about Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This is the best of both worlds. Sun Rong sees no reason not to agree.</p>

    <p>According to Jiugong Liangzi's plan.</p>

    <p>Now she pretends to be "Jiugong Liangzi", and monk Jin Deng pretends to be the female bodyguard "Junko Zhongchun."</p>

    <p>But this alone is not enough.</p>

    <p>Because you don't have to pretend at the beginning. You need to act according to the situation after landing on the island.</p>

    <p>If you just pretend to land on the island from the beginning, the purpose is too obvious.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there needs to be a cover...</p>

    <p>As for this point, Zhuo Yi has already helped Jiugong Liangzi think about it all.</p>

    <p>On the night when Jiugong Liangzi visited the Sun Rong villa.</p>

    <p>Almost at the same moment. Zhuo Yi also visited the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just welcomed Zhuo Yi into the bedroom. The moment the bedroom door closed.</p>

    <p>I saw Zhuo Yi immediately kneeling down and using the power of inertia to "drift" all the way towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then, he tightly hugged Wang Ling's thigh: ''Master! Apprentice begged you ...... Sun Island exchange program, you must go ah! The happiness of the second half of my life, all in the hands of you, my master, ah!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Island Exchange Student Program. There are three places in total.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is a specially designed cover operation by Zhuo Yi for the smooth progress of Jiugong's "transformation plan."</p>

    <p>Because it is essentially for investigation. Therefore, the exchange student quota can only be reserved this time.</p>

    <p>In other words, as a participant in the "Metamorphosis Plan", the monk will use the new teacher identity of "Huo Ding" as the "leading teacher" to accompany the inspection.</p>

    <p>And "Sun Rong" will also occupy an exchange student spot as a cover.</p>

    <p>Accompanying teachers are not included in the quota. Therefore, there are still two remaining places to actually participate in the exchange program.</p>

    <p>"..." At this time. Wang Ling touched his chin and thought for a while.</p>

    <p>Even if you agree to Zhuo Yi's request.</p>

    <p>So there is an extra spot. Who does Zhuo Yi plan to reserve for?</p>

    <p>"There are remaining places. Master, don't worry. As long as Master agrees..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "Mr. Wang Ming said. He wants to go."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned: "..."</p>

    <p>He understands everything. But the problem is. Wang Ming doesn't seem to be a student of Number 60 High School... This seems a bit too forced!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi seems to have considered Wang Ling's problem a long time ago: "Master, don't worry. Because Mr. Ming used the identity of Wang Xiaoer to participate in the military training exercises of the six schools before. So Mr. Ming's student status information is actually still in Number 60 High School. It's just on suspension. It can be activated at any time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>
