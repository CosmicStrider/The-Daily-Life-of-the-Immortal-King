  <h1>Chapter 2060 Qiao Yanyuan fights three Human Ancestors</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As soon as he said these words, the entire temple suddenly fell silent. Several saints under the Holy King fell silent at the same time.</p>

    <p>Blindfolded?</p>

    <p>What does this mean?</p>

    <p>Does this mean that the entire Saint Clan is now under surveillance?</p>

    <p>Although Qiao Yanyuan did not say who specifically was the person who blinded the Saints. As the leader of the Saints, those unforgettable dead fish eyes still clearly appeared in the Holy King's mind.</p>

    <p>How is this possible...</p>

    <p>From the earth to the temple of the saints. Such a long distance. No matter how powerful the other party is, it is impossible to quietly monitor them for that long.</p>

    <p>On the Holy Star, especially near the temple with the Holy King as the core. The eight saints under him are all ruthless characters. They are aware of all the troubles on the Holy Star.</p>

    <p>Even though Fenmu Shen does not have the omniscient and omnipotent cosmic insight that Fenmu Shen did after inheriting the Sotos tradition, the Holy Star is his home after all. He did not even notice that someone installed a surveillance camera in his home. This is really unreasonable.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that the Eight Great Saints did not even react to this matter. It is not outrageous.</p>

    <p>But now, Qiao Yanyuan personally came to visit and exposed the matter directly. On the surface, it seemed to be a well-intentioned reminder from the alliance. But in fact, his words directly made the eight saints present feel their backs. Chills. Incessant sweating.</p>

    <p>"Listen to Mr. Qiao. Our Saint Clan is always under surveillance. I have to remind Mr. Qiao that this is the Saint Clan."</p>

    <p>It was the same Holy Lord from before. He took a step forward, holding the scepter in hand. Facing Qiao Yanyuan: "Safety on the Holy Star. All troubles and dangers are guarded by my eight people. No one can make mistakes. Even the magical power of Wang. Guangda. planted surveillance on us. But there is no way that the eight of us will not react at all to this matter."</p>

    <p>He said this. He sounded old-fashioned, but in fact he didn't have much confidence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's method. The Holy Clan has learned about it. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to choose to ally with Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>So the Eight Saints themselves didn't know whether the Holy Star was being monitored or not.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan's visit this time directly revealed this matter. This not only slapped their eight saints in the face, but also made the saint king lose his face.</p>

    <p>When the Holy Lord spoke about this matter, he was actually hinting to Qiao Yanyuan not to continue to expose this matter.</p>

    <p>Who would have expected that this dragonborn who came here with only his soul would give no face to him at all.</p>

    <p>A "chi" sound. This laughter that sounded like contempt echoed directly throughout the entire temple, breaking the silence of the entire temple.</p>

    <p>"That's why I say that the saints of the saint clan are nothing more than this. In the universe, the strong are respected. As long as there are strong ones, there is no need to rely on their own qualifications. They are useless people who rely on their old age and sell themselves off." Qiao Yanyuan said with full contempt in his eyes. He glanced at the saint who took the initiative to stand up. The white robe on his body was written with saint characters. Qiao Yanyuan had learned the saint characters and knew that it actually represented the number "eight."</p>

    <p>"Who are you calling a waste?" The voice of the Eighth Holy Lord immediately turned cold.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I'm not targeting you." Qiao Yanyuan put his hands behind his back. He didn't pay attention to everyone at all: "I mean, all the saints here are trash."</p>

    <p>"You are a detached soul. You are on top of the hall of my holy clan. You still want to turn the world upside down!" Upon hearing this, all the saints suddenly became furious. They were so angry that they trembled all over. Maybe they do have some knowledge in this matter. It was a crime of negligence. But Qiao Yanyuan's shameless exposure and provocation made them intolerable.</p>

    <p>"Lao Ba, please step back. Let us teach him a lesson!" Before the Eighth Saint took action, Qiao Yanyuan saw Number 567 in the field. The three Saints moved together and jointly cast spells to suppress him.</p>

    <p>The spiritual power attributes of these three people are similar. They seem to be triplets. Therefore, when they work together, their spiritual power will resonate and react, doubling their power again.</p>

    <p>"Interesting. Since you don't want to admit that you are a waste and you have nothing to do with me, you actually have three brothers joining forces to join forces?" Qiao Yanyuan laughed even louder.</p>

    <p>He mocked almost without thinking. His original intention of coming this time was not to provoke a war, but to remind him with good intentions. But he didn't expect that these losers would not reflect on themselves at all. Instead, they turned their anger onto themselves to try to divert attention. Sure enough, the essence of all living things in the world is the same. They will never admit their mistakes easily. This makes Qiao Yanyuan feel very disappointed. He is not afraid of opponents who are like gods. He is afraid of teammates who are like pigs.</p>

    <p>Even though the Saints are now allies, this arrogant and ignorant attitude really makes Qiao Yanyuan feel disgusted.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the five, six, and seven brothers joined forces to suppress him. The huge seas of spiritual power from the three Human Ancestor realms converged together, forming a giant pliers that pressed towards Qiao Yanyuan, trying to pin him down directly and cut him off at the waist.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan did not dodge. He just snapped his fingers. He immediately opened a spiritual barrier on his body and directly caught the attack of the giant pincer.</p>

    <p>On the throne of the temple, the Holy King sees everything.</p>

    <p>This Qiao Yanyuan was weirder than he thought.</p>

    <p>Much scarier than Jingze and Yan. With just a simple spiritual barrier, he actually withstood the attacks of three human-level people. So as a dragonborn, what state is he in now?</p>

    <p>It is taboo to do something directly in the temple, unless there is the tacit approval of the Holy King.</p>

    <p>The Eight Saints' hearts are like mirrors. Although they really wanted to divert the conflict, the Holy King's tacit approval also wanted to use their hands to explore the reality of Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>Because not long ago, the Saints heard the secret about Qiao Yanyuan. There is news that this person is the strongest dragon descendant currently under Bai Zhe. He is a trump card that can be called a secret weapon.</p>

    <p>Now this is the first appearance. Although it is a direct fight, it can also confirm some rumors.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the three saints joined forces to suppress. Qiao Yanyuan easily withstood the pressure. He didn't even show off his dragon-born ability. He didn't even use his dragon-born magic weapon. He only relied on the most basic combat power. The effect was achieved with ease.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The spiritual barrier on his body was astonishingly thick. Even the giant pincers of the three Human Ancestors could not crush the barrier. Under such a thorough defense, Qiao Yanyuan also directly began to fight back.</p>

    <p>He was merciless. He looked like a ghost. He picked up the Number 6 Saint in the middle and started to break the formation. He grabbed the man's robe and smashed it onto the cold and hard ground of the temple.</p>

    <p>The ground of the entire temple collapsed and trembled violently. Countless gold powder fell on the high ceiling of the temple with the shock.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan's speed and strength are extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Without any modification, just physical combat, such a violent aesthetic is perfectly interpreted.</p>

    <p>And this is the scariest thing about him.</p>

    <p>Such a mysterious dragonborn is already so tyrannical even before he reveals his trump card. If you take it seriously, it would be so scary... Besides, this is just a soul!</p>

    <p>"Stop it."</p>

    <p>So at this moment, the Holy King, who had been silent for a long time, finally spoke.</p>

    <p>He was originally testing Qiao Yanyuan. He didn't want the war to continue to expand. Otherwise, his entire temple would have to be renovated.</p>

    <p>However, Qiao Yanyuan's domineering attitude was still beyond his imagination.</p>

    <p>"call out!"</p>

    <p>He opened the silver dragon wing on his right side, slashed out a wing blade, and directly cut off one of the arms of Holy Lord Number 6. In front of the Holy King, blood was sprinkled on the temple.</p>
