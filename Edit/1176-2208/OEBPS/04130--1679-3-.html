  <h1>Chapter 1679 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The white ancient god jade cannon has a little black light condensed in the middle. It carries a strong power of chaos, causing the nearby space to be shaken, like a glass plate exploding to pieces.</p>

    <p>This power is amazing. It is so terrifying that it makes people stop breathing and speechless.</p>

    <p>"Senior Qin...really don't need a barrier?" Sun Rong is still worried about this.</p>

    <p>If this shot hits them, although with the fighting power of everyone here, it may not kill them directly, but the pain will probably be very painful!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong originally wanted to use Aohai's sword energy barrier and monk Jin Deng's consecration technique to strengthen the barrier. Although this would consume a lot of spiritual energy, it might be able to withstand the blow. But now Qin Zhong She stood directly in front of everyone, making her seem a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qin, can you do it..." Xiang Yi opened his eyes wide and lay on the ground. He looked away from the scope and looked suspicious.</p>

    <p>He actually didn't know much about Qin Zhong's origins. He only heard on the way that Qin Zhong claimed to be the only koi in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Koi?</p>

    <p>There are too many lucky people in this world. Xiang Yi feels that his luck is quite good. Otherwise, he would not have been able to build the wasteland cultivation world into such an impressive place.</p>

    <p>Almost all young and accomplished people in cultivation have more or less luck.</p>

    <p>Luck is something that cannot be explained clearly, and the entity cannot be seen. In Xiang Yi's opinion, relying solely on one's own luck is of little use.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this time, the extremely white beam of ancient divine jade made a sound in the air. It exploded on the spot, like the roar of a heavenly drum.</p>

    <p>Everything in the path of the destruction beam was showing a scene of collapse and destruction. The earth overturned and was cut into pieces. Endless cracks spread. The scene was blurred.</p>

    <p>Countless boulders in the Supreme World were shattered by the beam, forming a large amount of gravel and sand dancing wildly in the sky. Qin Zhong stood alone in front of everyone with his arms folded.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng, Xiang Yi, Leng Ming, Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi and others all frowned. Because they really believed Qin Zhong's lies. They did not put up a defensive posture at all.</p>

    <p>If such a destructive blow were to hit, God knows what would happen.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, however, stood calmly in front of him. At this time, everyone saw a seven-color airflow rising from his body. There were streaks of rays of light above him, blooming with magical light.</p>

    <p>"Could this be..." Everyone was shocked. They couldn't believe what they were seeing.</p>

    <p>"This is the essence of luck. How can someone really transform this ethereal thing into reality?" Even monk Jin Deng found it extremely incredible.</p>

    <p>He saw that these condensed luck condensed into a huge seven-color koi behind Qin Zhong. With a flick of its tail, the fierce white aurora was instantly blown away. He actually used his own force to blow it away. Luck. Changed the trajectory of Aurora to an angle.</p>

    <p>Then this aurora of ancient divine jade impacted the barrier of the supreme world!</p>

    <p>This barrier was originally set up by Nawei himself to prevent Sun Rong, Jin Deng and others from escaping.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, when the white ancient jade beam rushed up, it was refracted back by the barrier. Killing two birds with one stone, it penetrated from a weird angle. It broke through the Nawei barrier and directly broke through. The two thighs of the ancient giant.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a painful roar, his huge body fell uncontrollably, raising a large amount of dust. At the same time, Xiang Yi's bullet with eight thousand years of cultivation also hit him at the same time.</p>

    <p>It only took a short moment. Under Qin Zhong's terrible luck, the ancient god giant's limbs suffered devastating blows.</p>

    <p>"Wow!" At the same time, Wang Nuan couldn't help but want to take action. She sat on Leng Ming's neck and began to wave her little fists, as if she was going to beat the ancient god giant.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan wanted to take action. Jin Deng and the others did not move. They gave Ah Nuan girl a chance to show off. They stood and watched from a distance.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming used his sword energy to firmly attach Wang Nuan to his shoulders. He tried his best to let Ah Nuan girl use him as a chair in a comfortable posture.</p>

    <p>The two of them were less than ten years old together. They were just two children. And one of them was still a baby. They didn't look so lethal and destructive. The moment the fleshy little fist was swung out, it seemed that It brings a complete confusion to people.</p>

    <p>It looks like it doesn't feel painful at all.</p>

    <p>However, when Leng Ming and Wang Nuan approached, the Ancient God Giant, whose limbs were still recovering, let out a shrill scream originating from Nawei.</p>

    <p>"Ouch..."</p>

    <p>Two giant shadow arms poked out of the ground. They were the shadows of the Giant himself. Ah Nuan girl manipulated the two shadow arms. Like a chicken, she was pulling at the Giant's thighs, which were still in the process of being replicated.</p>

    <p>Actually started trying to attack his midsection like he said he would.</p>

    <p>Nawei screams again and again.</p>

    <p>Though it was the Ancient God Giant who was injured. Not him.</p>

    <p>But the Goliath's nervous system is connected to his brain.</p>

    <p>And as a man. The most intolerable pain is a fatal blow to the midsection of the body.</p>

    <p>A group of people were turned to stone. The cruelty of Ah Nuan girl was beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>She was just a little girl who was just born. She actually used her little body like a grain of sand to tear apart a sixty-foot ancient giant...</p>

    <p>"Is this the way to master the skills of the barbarians to defeat the barbarians? He actually used the giant's shadow to defeat the giant. He is worthy of being the Lord of Shadow." Er Ha was full of admiration.</p>

    <p>But they know it very well. This fact is not the full strength of Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>"Damn thing. I'm going to cut you into pieces..." Inside the body of the Ancient God Giant. Nawei, who controlled the giant, was in severe pain. His anger reached the extreme.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. He actually used a gecko's tail-cutting technique, completely abandoning his lower body that was being torn apart, and detaching his upper body.</p>

    <p>Then the left and right legs, which were being separated like chicken legs in Wang Nuan's hands, turned into a large amount of black sand and were decomposed. Then they rejoined his lower body. They were so flexible that it was unimaginable.</p>

    <p>"Clang!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the transformed Nawei once again controlled the Ancient God Giant to take action. A golden spear appeared in his hand. It was more than a hundred feet tall. It was taller than his body!</p>

    <p>He held it with one arm, and then swung it violently. The spear pierced the void, bursting out with a lot of light, and drove towards Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>"That's wrong. Why does it feel like he's been being abused all the time? But his aura hasn't weakened at all?" Lord Diulei felt something strange.</p>

    <p>"It's because his divine brain has become stronger again. Before, his divine brain wasn't fully activated..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng said: "If we really wait until his brain is activated to the level of Master Wu Xin, maybe no one here except Nuan Zhenren will be his opponent."</p>
