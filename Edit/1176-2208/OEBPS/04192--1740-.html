  <h1>Chapter 1740 Explosive Hammer Cleansing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"You hit me. I am not injured. Therefore, you have no chance of winning this battle. I admit that you are very strong. You can be regarded as a genius. But sometimes, the problem of bloodline suppression goes back to the root cause and can never be solved."</p>

    <p>Jingze laughed. There was a sense of arrogance on his face when he said this. As the inheritor of the dragon bloodline, the dragon genes they carry make him confident enough.</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling is really strong. It surpasses everyone he has met before. And it has refreshed his understanding of human cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>But this vanity and pride will not let him admit this frustration.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he raised his hands at the same time. Golden thunder danced on the two immortal diamond gloves.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>In fact, it was two finger snaps from the left and right hands. They were made at the same time. They were aimed at Wang Ling. A powerful spiritual energy came in and moved towards him to suppress it.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by this spiritual wave with powerful suppressive power, there was a golden rain all over the sky. Even Wang Ling had never seen such a magical sight. He never thought that lightning could be like heavy rain. It's generally roaring. It's coming in overwhelming numbers.</p>

    <p>And. In the large swath of electric light, chaotic energy surged. It was generated in Wang Ling's body!</p>

    <p>The sequence level of this immortal diamond glove has reached level three. Its basic ability is to generate chaos in the body of a locked creature. It is then detonated multiple times by external lightning, thunder and spiritual pressure, thereby exploding the power of chaos in the body of the creature.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling really felt a breath of gas being generated in his body. It felt like drinking too much cola, which produced a large amount of carbon dioxide gas in the body. It gave a feeling of bloating.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's internal organs are extremely powerful. Far beyond Jingze's imagination. Under normal circumstances, one snap of his fingers is enough. In the end, he snapped his fingers twice at the same time. Wang Ling didn't seem to have any Big changes...</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth and snapped his fingers a few more times.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, the reaction he had been waiting for finally arrived!</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ling's belly bulging slightly. It felt like it was about to explode at any moment.</p>

    <p>The expression on Jingze's face was filled with excitement. He eagerly wanted to see Wang Ling fall apart.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Then at the next moment, a stream of purple air like a long dragon spurted out from Wang Ling's mouth like a destructive death light!</p>

    <p>At this moment, countless chaotic energy accumulated in Wang Ling's body by the immortal diamond gloves were released together! It produced amazing destructive power!</p>

    <p>"Fuck!"</p>

    <p>Jingze couldn't help but swear. This was the first time he saw such a person...</p>

    <p>It was actually possible to turn the base ability of his Diamond Glove into nothingness in the form of a burp.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>There was a crisp sound, like two pieces of jade clashing. Jingze held the God-Eating Umbrella in his hand and opened the umbrella completely, resisting the chaotic airflow that came out of Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>What kind of monster is this...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jingze was also feeling emotional. He felt that he was in trouble.</p>

    <p>However, as a brave and skilled dragonborn, he felt an unprecedented excitement growing in his body.</p>

    <p>"Come on! Keep going!" He roared. The electric wings behind his back spread out and turned into lightning. He suddenly came forward, extremely fiercely. At the same time, his five fingers spread out. The diamond gloves on his hands were mixed with lightning, making a clanking sound.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>This palm carries the power of a giant dragon that belongs exclusively to Jingze. Wang Ling can see the virtual image formed behind him. It is an electric dragon with dragon wings that covers the sky and the sun. When the wings are spread out, it covered the whole sky.</p>

    <p>"Thousands of thunder!" Jingze shouted. With this palm, the thunder roared all around. It was extremely bright, with powerful spiritual energy ripples spreading to all directions. It could be said that it was magnificent.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the void trembled. The figures of everyone around them could not help but sway. They were slightly unstable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lifted his arm and used the strength of his single arm to counteract it with a gentle breeze, and this palm hit him right on his small arm.</p>

    <p>There was a sound of divine iron colliding. At the same time, the ground cracked under his feet. The power of thunder followed his body and shattered the reddish-brown land. It stretched for hundreds of miles. Everything was shattered by the power of thunder! Ah!</p>

    <p>Many employees of Baobai Group screamed at the same time. They were hit by this thunderous thunder. Even if they were wearing protective clothing, they were instantly chopped into charcoal. Only those farther away from the center survived.</p>

    <p>Those who were close were the worst off. They were chopped into powder. Not even ashes were left.</p>

    <p>Jingze's fighting behavior was completely reckless. He even killed his own people when he was ruthless. This was a serious violation of employee regulations. However, at this time, he was in high spirits and had no intention of caring about these many things.</p>

    <p>I just want to have a vigorous battle with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked extremely ancient from beginning to end. There was a surge of blue spiritual energy all over his body. This was the trace of surging mana. It carried a kind of terrifying power.</p>

    <p>After receiving Jingze's palm, his right palm almost instantly charged up and swung it towards his right face.</p>

    <p>Jingze couldn't even see clearly the trajectory of Wang Ling's palm. The next moment, his face was in close contact with Wang Ling's slap.</p>

    <p>Then, he flew away completely.</p>

    <p>With a bang, it turned into a point of light and flew towards the distance. It was like a pebble that was drifted on the sea. It kept rolling and crashing on the ground of Dragon Cemetery, and did not stop until it was very far away.</p>

    <p>Cough...</p>

    <p>He spit out a mouthful of blood. He was shocked to find that the healing effect of Eternal Moon's Armor on his body seemed to have weakened. He could obviously ignore the serious injury of Eternal Moon's Armor, but it didn't play its due role when this palm came. This made Jing Jing Ze couldn't help but feel doubtful.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling shook his hand and moved the joints on his wrist.</p>

    <p>Eternal Moon's Armor does have a restraining effect on serious injuries. However, the strength of the serious injury effect also depends on how powerful Wang Ling's own palm is.</p>

    <p>The first few times he beat Bai Zhe. Wang Ling didn't say that. That was all his power...</p>

    <p>The spiritual energy and power in his body are growing almost every day. When he wakes up, it reaches a new level.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as long as the power of his slap is strong enough, it will be enough to offset the effect of Eternal Moon's Armor.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current effect, the power of the palm just now seems not enough. Although the instant healing effect of Eternal Moon's Armor has disappeared, Jingze can still be restored.</p>

    <p>This is not a situation Wang Ling wants to see.</p>

    <p>What he wanted to see was the scene of Jingze being beaten to pieces by him.</p>

    <p>Who asked him to touch Wang Nuan...</p>

    <p>Since you dare to try, don't be afraid of death.</p>

    <p>He didn't even wait for Jingze to get up from the pit. His whole figure came closer again. Like a ghost, he directly swung his legs, describing it as a dragon and a snake. He swept directly over and scooped Jingze up from the ground and kicked him into the air.</p>

    <p>No one would doubt the power of Wang Ling's kick. It was powerful enough to break the stars...</p>

    <p>However, what Jingze faced was not just Wang Ling's kick.</p>

    <p>And next. Wang Ling aims at the void and slaps away the immortal diamond gloves...</p>
