  <h1>Chapter 1523 Houlang Sang's real technology</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When she spoke, the girl's voice was not particularly loud, but her serious look still shocked Jisaki.</p>

    <p>"It's great that Rong Jiang can find someone he really likes." He was happy for Sun Rong from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>This may be a kind of relief after being rejected.</p>

    <p>In his impression, Sun Rong did not collapse because of rejecting him. Instead, it became more three-dimensional than before.</p>

    <p>Isn't a girl like this a girl worth cherishing for the person she really likes, bravely asking out other people who have a crush on her, and then sending out "good guy cards"...?</p>

    <p>In terms of emotions, Jisaki has never been pushy.</p>

    <p>He feels that emotionally, expressing one's true feelings is the right way to go.</p>

    <p>If you like it, you just like it.</p>

    <p>If you don't like it, just say it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Don't let people get misunderstood.</p>

    <p>Many boys and girls, just because they are hesitant, do not know how to express their position, and then leave many spare tires... This is a very impolite behavior of scumbag men and scumbag women.</p>

    <p>Because of personality reasons, some of these people may not do it intentionally, while some simply want to raise more wallets that can provide them with nutrients.</p>

    <p>"No matter what, I still want to thank you this time. Rong Jiang." Jisaki thanked him from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ji, why do you want to thank me?" Sun Rong probably knew what Jisaki was thinking. But out of politeness, she still asked.</p>

    <p>He laughed: "I remember I had a brother who liked a girl. The girl never rejected him directly. Instead, she even sent him messages asking him to buy this and that,..., and my brother pursued her with all his heart, until one day when he was eating at a restaurant, he found this girl with other boys."</p>

    <p>"This is too much. How can you hang someone up like this?" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Who says it isn't?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki sighed: "Later, my buddy felt that he had been cheated. He came forward to question her on the spot. But after looking through the girl's mobile phone address book, he found that besides himself, she was also having with 78 boys at the same time. Chat as girlfriend."</p>

    <p>"Seventy-eight..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard the corner of his eye twitching.</p>

    <p>Jisaki smiled: "So Rong Jiang took the initiative to talk to me about everything. I'm actually very happy. Besides, we can still be friends, right?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>This meeting in the cafe went more smoothly than she imagined.</p>

    <p>At this time, a clerk suddenly entered their private room rashly: "Hello, Miss, would you like to refill the cup of coffee with crispy noodles..."</p>

    <p>The clerk just pushed in the door. He saw that the people sitting inside were different from the ones he had just served. Then he realized he had made a mistake.</p>

    <p>He quickly apologized: "Ah, I'm sorry. I went to the wrong place... I disturbed you two. I'm so sorry!"</p>

    <p>This time, Sun Rong just noticed something: "Wait a minute. Who ordered this cup of coffee?"</p>

    <p>"Sorry, girl...we can't reveal customer privacy." The clerk smiled.</p>

    <p>He quickly pushed out of the private room. Sun Rong followed him out.</p>

    <p>Shop assistant: "..."</p>

    <p>"You gave it to me. I was passing by." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>The clerk had no choice but to go to the private room where Wang Ming was and bring the coffee in.</p>

    <p>When he entered the door, the boy was stunned for a moment because he found that the young man who had invented this new way of drinking coffee was missing.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoer. Sister Yinzi. What a coincidence!" Sun Rong smiled knowingly.</p>

    <p>The eavesdropping was revealed. Wang Ming and Zhai Yin quickly raised their eyebrows.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was a pity just now. Because Wang Ling did not hear the end. After drinking the coffee in his hand, he disappeared instantly. It seemed that some emergency had occurred...</p>

    <p>But judging from Wang Ling's temper, even if he heard it, he probably wouldn't have any reaction.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did run away halfway. And it was indeed because of something.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't what Wang Ming said. It was an emergency.</p>

    <p>Because he received a message from the Sun Island Mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself did not expect what was explained in the early morning. The three people in Yitong immediately launched a series of investigations, and some clues were already drawn.</p>

    <p>Next to Jiudaohe High School is the nearest Hefeng Park. Wang Ling and the representative of the three, the middle-aged Mediterranean man, successfully completed the joint activity.</p>

    <p>In front of an ice cream shop, I was holding a cone sprinkled with crispy toppings, waiting for Wang Ling to arrive.</p>

    <p>It's just a blink of an eye. Wang Ling has already appeared in front of Icyon's eyes.</p>

    <p>For security reasons, Wang Ling has maximized the effect of "Great Shield."</p>

    <p>In other words, even if someone witnesses me now, as long as I leave for a while, they will all forget about it.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang...our investigation has reached new heights."</p>

    <p>Yitong handed the cone to Wang Ling. Then he explained the clues he had obtained so far with a serious face.</p>

    <p>"That's right. After receiving the mission in the early morning, we immediately investigated the residence of classmate Ma Jiao."</p>

    <p>One tube said, "The investigation has learned that in addition to the school's dedicated single room dormitory for the S District Student Council officers, Sparrow's residence is actually an additional villa just within the city of Tung Fu on Sun Island. The name was attributed to Ma Jiao-schoolmate."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, a picture of the birth certificate information about this villa was displayed.</p>

    <p>This was taken using special means. It can be seen that there was a lot of rush when collecting information. But the key information is all there. And the photos are very clear.</p>

    <p>It was only now that Wang Ling realized Ma Jiao's full name: Rokume Akahoko.</p>

    <p>At first glance. It's a familiar name.</p>

    <p>Especially the word "Aka" in the middle.</p>

    <p>Because this Aka. It's the Aka of the Akano family.</p>

    <p>And the Akano family is the one that currently controls the Zhai Xing Group, the largest underworld organization on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Even without extrapolating, Wang Ling still has a vague feeling.</p>

    <p>He feels that Ma Jiao is related to the Akano family.</p>

    <p>And the facts prove that the results are indeed true.</p>

    <p>"With the financial strength of that crazy girl, it is absolutely impossible for her to own her own villa in an area like Dongfu City. So we conducted an in-depth investigation into the girl's identity."</p>

    <p>"It turns out that this girl is the illegitimate daughter of Akano Sekitora, the current leader of the Zhai Xing Group. And this villa was bought for her by Akano Sekitora."</p>

    <p>At present, all information has key photos as evidence.</p>

    <p>"To confirm this, we specially extracted the girl's DNA." Yitong said.</p>

    <p>They were unable to collect the DNA information of Akano Sekitora. However, they still had the DNA information of Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi has always been wary of the sixth wife in their family.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we have already made plans to extract DNA data.</p>

    <p>The method is also very simple.</p>

    <p>Just collect the tableware used by Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>From the saliva above, you can get the DNA data of the Akano family.</p>

    <p>As for Ma Jiao's DNA data, it is more difficult to obtain it in one tube.</p>

    <p>First of all, Ma Jiao is a cautious and clean person.</p>

    <p>This is true whether it is a residence or a villa.</p>

    <p>Spotless.</p>

    <p>Not even a hair.</p>

    <p>But what a coincidence...</p>

    <p>They have very good luck with a tube.</p>

    <p>Because just this morning.</p>

    <p>They found out that Ma Jiao's aunt was here.</p>

    <p>This is a physiological phenomenon that every girl cannot avoid.</p>

    <p>And after Ma Jiao left the women's room.</p>

    <p>One tube went straight into the school girls' toilet.</p>

    <p>He snatched the blood-stained sanitary napkin from the trash can...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he has been trained by Jiugong Xiushi since childhood and has been with him for a long time. They are comparable to the veteran Sun Island Mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>It's really neat and tidy to do things.</p>

    <p>And. Not afraid of hardships...</p>

    <p>After having this information from Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>The story line in Wang Ling's mind began to become clearer.</p>

    <p>Everything was just as he thought.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao is related to Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>As for the "human-ghost combination technology" that Zhai Xing Group has been experimenting with, Ma Jiao was the first subject to be used as an experiment by Akano Sekitora.</p>

    <p>After all, Jiugong Xinghui is the daughter of his original wife. With completely different priorities... Akano Sekitora took his private illegitimate daughter Ma Jiao. as the first experimental subject.</p>

    <p>Tiger poison does not eat its seeds.</p>

    <p>Such evil deeds are horrifying to hear.</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling finally discovered the reason why Ma Jiao became so crazy.</p>

    <p>The source of it all and sin.</p>

    <p>It all started with Akano Sekitora of Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Wang Ling already knows it in his mind.</p>

    <p>Last night, after he sent his avatar to cause trouble in the Golden City of Zhai Xing Group, Akano Sekitora and the silver-skinned king disappeared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling judged that the other party should have been protected by Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>All three of them are now hiding in the space covered by the power of the black stone, "fighting the landlord"...</p>

    <p>The situation now seems to be stable again.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling feels that it will not last long.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren would not have the patience to wait for too long.</p>

    <p>This is a ferocious snake that lurks in the dark.</p>

    <p>Once the other party feels that it is a suitable opportunity to take action, they will definitely not miss it.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling needs to do now.</p>

    <p>Just wait.</p>

    <p>As well as.</p>

    <p>Create opportunities for them to think they can take action and win...</p>

    <p>However, there is only one chance to lure the snake out of its hole.</p>

    <p>Because next time, if I use the same method to deceive again, I'm afraid it won't be that easy.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already has a winning strategy in mind.</p>

    <p>This time.</p>

    <p>Once Peng Xiren emerges.</p>

    <p>He will definitely capture Peng Xiren and the mysterious black stone.</p>

    <p>One person.</p>

    <p>One stone.</p>

    <p>He wants them all.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time: Wednesday, December 16. 1:30 pm.</p>

    <p>After parting ways with Yitong. Wang Ling returned to Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, he warned him to return to his natural state. Even if Jiugong Xiushi asked him to do something to him, he should not disobey Jiugong Xiushi.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling will make everything happen by accident. Even if Jiugong Xiushi blames him, he cannot blame several people.</p>

    <p>In other words, there are now one tube, two tubes and three tubes. These three people are closest to Jiugong Xiushi.</p>

    <p>Now they are all chess pieces that Wang Ling can call.</p>

    <p>This will play a key factor in Sun Rong's plan to disguise Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>After returning to Class S where he was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that Class S seems to have become a lot more "harmony" today.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. If you don't understand anything, you can ask me."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang? Are you thirsty? I'll buy you a drink. You can drink whatever you want."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Ah! Houlang Sang. You can come with Rong Jiang when you go abroad this time. Don't you have a particularly good relationship with her?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. Rong Jiang said you are stronger than her? Rong Jiang must be joking, right? You are so soft and cute. Just like a slime. Are you really that strong?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of Sun Rong's showdown and reconciliation with Akano Jisaki.</p>

    <p>Many people saw that the relationship between Sun Rong and Jisaki had become better. The originally tense atmosphere suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>And there are always people asking Wang Ling some weird questions...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly screamed for the truth.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I also paid some attention to classmate Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Just like before, Ma Jiao still looked like it had nothing to do with her.</p>

    <p>When school was over that day, Jisaki, the student council president, officially announced the news.</p>

    <p>It is said that they are planning to hold a closed-door cultivator martial arts meeting within Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>The reason why we chose to close the door is actually the result of Jisaki fully combining the meaning of Sun Rong after putting forward his opinions.</p>

    <p>Because the ranking of Sun Island high school students was hacked last night.</p>

    <p>As a result, the data has not yet been recovered.</p>

    <p>Everyone's ID in the entire ranking is called Houlang...</p>

    <p>Therefore, the major high school student unions on Sun Island decided to hold closed-door martial arts meetings in their own high schools.</p>

    <p>Choose the five most powerful representatives.</p>

    <p>The five-member delegation will directly represent the school to participate in the group stage.</p>

    <p>Students are selected from 100 high schools and finally ranked based on the overall score in the competition.</p>

    <p>Likewise. All processes are behind closed doors.</p>

    <p>Except for the participants, the entire competition is private. Filming and live broadcasting are also prohibited.</p>

    <p>Almost all colleges and universities expressed unanimous support for choosing a "closed-door" competition this time...</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling feel incredible.</p>

    <p>You know, most of today's young people are the pushy type...</p>

    <p>Later I found out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only knew.</p>

    <p>It turns out that there will be a larger, world-wide high school cultivator open competition held behind Sun Island...</p>

    <p>Many colleges and universities agreed to this closed-door challenge in order to conceal their tactics in advance.</p>

    <p>It's not public anyway. Video recording of the whole process is prohibited.</p>

    <p>Even if the tactics are used in advance, they will not be disseminated for people to study.</p>

    <p>And the key is that it won't be too embarrassing if you lose...</p>

    <p>There are benefits to being behind closed doors.</p>

    <p>At least psychologically. There's not that much pressure.</p>

    <p>When school was over, Jisaki placed an invitation letter on the Wang Ling table.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his head and looked at Jisaki with confusion.</p>

    <p>Jisaki smiled and said: "Even if it is temporary, Houlang Sang is now a member of our Jiudaohe! I sincerely hope that Houlang Sang can also participate in this event! Although we don't spend much time together, I have a hunch that we can become good friends. Friends?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And everyone is very interested in Houlang Sang. I also hope that Houlang Sang can pass this closed-door competition and show everyone his real skills."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a while.</p>

    <p>Eventually.</p>

    <p>I accepted the invitation anyway.</p>

    <p>Since it's a closed-door match...</p>

    <p>It doesn't hurt to participate.</p>

    <p>As for whether or not to show your true skills...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it's better to skip it.</p>
