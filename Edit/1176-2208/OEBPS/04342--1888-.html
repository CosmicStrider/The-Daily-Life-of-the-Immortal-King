  <h1>Chapter 1888: Be ruthless and even make arrangements for yourself</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Relying on their position on Penglai Planet, the Peng family is so powerful that even the guards of the ancient city have been assimilated. They are fierce, chivalrous and extremely arrogant.</p>

    <p>It can be seen from the attitude towards outsiders. The carriage Wang Ling and others are riding has an obvious nine-star royal family logo. It symbolizes that the people in the carriage are direct descendants of a certain emperor.</p>

    <p>However, even so, this group of assimilated ancient city guards also did not take them seriously. This is completely unreasonable. They did not take this group of great emperors seriously.</p>

    <p>Such arrogance undoubtedly made Emperor Dongda very angry. He instinctively wanted to slap the guard hard.</p>

    <p>However, as soon as he raised his hand, Wang Ying forcibly controlled his body and held him down. He said: "Just use your breath to shock. If your slap falls, the guard will die. It will not be conducive to our subsequent plans."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the breath shock was conveyed simultaneously. Wang Ying only released a little bit of spiritual pressure. The expressions of these ancient city guards suddenly changed drastically. They could no longer laugh anymore.</p>

    <p>They seemed to be petrified. They stood in place, not daring to move at all.</p>

    <p>"They are finished. The realm of this life has stopped here. They will not advance any further." At this time, Monk Jin Deng spoke. He saw some clues.</p>

    <p>This is not just an ordinary aura shock. It also imposes some legal curses. These arrogant ancient city guards received the most terrifying punishment for cultivators.</p>

    <p>But for them, this is a far more miserable punishment than killing them.</p>

    <p>However, even so, Emperor Dongda was still depressed and could not express his feelings: "These people, who eat the public food of our four regions, do such things to betray the Lord and seek glory. It is really a crime that cannot be unpunished!"</p>

    <p>It is hard to imagine that Emperor Dongda, who has always been gentle and kind among the four emperors, would be so angry.</p>

    <p>If the other emperors had not been possessed by outsiders at this time, he is afraid that these ancient city guards would also be dead.</p>

    <p>Seemingly expecting Emperor Dongda to have such a reaction, Wang Ying said calmly: "Environment can change people. Vanity, privilege, anything that can taint people's hearts may cause these people to have the illusion that they are superior to others. Thus completely forgetting that I am just dust in this world."</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying said made everyone think deeply. Even Wang Ling was a little surprised. He never expected that his own shadow would have such profound thoughts.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Wang Ling himself will think about what the essence of cultivation is. Occasionally, he will weave a few golden sentences in his mind. However, these words Wang Ling have never been shared with outsiders.</p>

    <p>Because he found that there were too few people who could truly understand him, or that they simply did not exist.</p>

    <p>This kind of loneliness at a high place can only be described as "it's cold at high places"...</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda tried his best to calm down. In the end, he listened to Wang Ying's words and did not deal harshly with the ancient city guards in front of him.</p>

    <p>Of course, although Wang Ying's law curse does exist, it does not completely give these ancient city guards no chance.</p>

    <p>"If they can wake up and pull back from the brink in this life, this curse will naturally be lifted. But unfortunately, they have fallen too deep." Wang Ying sighed.</p>

    <p>"What on earth did the Peng family instill in them?" Liu Qingyi looked at these ancient city guards who seemed to be petrified. She felt very regretful in her heart.</p>

    <p>They have been practicing for more than a thousand years. They were originally selected to serve as the ancient city guards of the Central Galaxy. If they can wait until the handover and return to their respective leaders, they will definitely have a bright future.</p>

    <p>But who could have imagined that these people chose to commit suicide on this day. It can only be said that this is also a kind of destiny.</p>

    <p>A number of carriages bearing the nine-star royal family logo finally landed outside Penglai City. The aura emanating from the bejeweled Peng Family Palace in the city reached straight to the sky across the city wall. Looking down from the sky, the shock of this golden mansion makes people feel that the Peng family is even more domineering.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and others originally wanted to park the carriage directly at the entrance of the Peng family's headquarters.</p>

    <p>However, the carriage could not move. It was only when they approached Penglai City that they discovered the luxurious carriages. Various mythical beasts and vehicles were arranged in an orderly manner in front of the Peng family's headquarters.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? There's a traffic jam in the Eternal World?" Sun Rong frowned in the Pegasus carriage.</p>

    <p>"I'll go ask."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui immediately got out of the carriage and took the prepared Hunling Stone as a reward. He grabbed a passing cultivator and asked him.</p>

    <p>This casual cultivator received a large amount of inquiry fees. The expression that was originally a little unhappy at being stopped instantly relaxed: "That's right. These carriages are all here to propose marriage. I think you... are not here to propose marriage too?"</p>

    <p>"There are so many marriage proposals?" Everyone was surprised.</p>

    <p>This is the news they received from the four emperors' intelligence network. It should be first-hand information. But no one would have thought that the door-to-door marriage proposal had already begun.</p>

    <p>And there was a long queue right in front of the Peng family headquarters.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui understood instantly. The only possibility is that the Peng family first released the news locally and started open recruitment.</p>

    <p>However, the nature of this is completely different. The local families on Penglai Star, no matter how big they are, cannot be as big as the Peng family itself, so the son-in-law they find is certainly no match for the Pengs. He's a bastard son-in-law at best! And he's not even the Dragon King's son-in-law!</p>

    <p>This surprised everyone at Wang Ling's side.</p>

    <p>This Peng Bei Cen is the daughter of the Peng family, she's not going to find a clumsy son-in-law who doesn't fit the family mold?</p>

    <p>How anxious are you to get yourself married?</p>

    <p>"Miss Peng is a person with a very eccentric temper. It was her idea to propose marriage this time. Mr. Peng loves her very much, so almost all matters are handled by Miss Peng herself."</p>

    <p>The passerby, a casual cultivator, said with an expression on his face: "If anyone can be favored by Miss Peng, whether it is a matchmaker marrying someone or a son-in-law entering the family, it will be a supreme honor. Being tied to the big ship of the Peng family. From now on. There is definitely no shortage of spiritual resources."</p>

    <p>"What else do you know?" Zhang Zhui asked as he gave another bag of mixed spirit stones.</p>

    <p>The passerby, a casual cultivator, showed a satisfied expression. He nodded and said, "I advise you to leave. This Miss Peng family is a person with strong desires. Although I feel bound to be tied to the boat of the Peng family, he might also suffer from kidney overdraft!"</p>

    <p>"Kidney overdraft!? Strong desire? Why do you say that?"</p>

    <p>"Because I heard that the person Miss Peng is going to marry today is not just a son-in-law... This long line of people is recruiting a harem for herself!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So how many of them have you picked now?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet. Because the requirements are too high." A passerby, a casual cultivator, sighed: "Hahaha. I was just watching the fun. There was a guy named Kuxuan who was rejected by Miss Peng. When Miss Peng saw him, she said he had kidney disease."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
