  <h1>Chapter 1718 The clown is actually myself</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The night was miserable. The faint moonlight shone on the only building in the Eastern Wilderness. The tiles on the top floor of the Wang family's small villa had a faint white reflection.</p>

    <p>To be cautious, Jingze used his spiritual sense to sense the atmosphere in the villa. He found that there was nothing unusual. This was just an ordinary residence for an ordinary cultivator family.</p>

    <p>He didn't quite understand why "Wang Nuan" on the list became the object of special treatment. On the surface, there seemed to be nothing unusual about it.</p>

    <p>Sitting on the large concrete pipe in the abandoned lot in front of the Wang family's villa, Yan? began to lick popsicles. He looked like he was not interested: "Brother Jingze, you can do it alone, right?"</p>

    <p>She asked.</p>

    <p>Because it's too ordinary. I feel like I don't need to take action.</p>

    <p>"The entrance is right there. I can go alone." Jingze nodded. Then he slowly walked closer and began to knock on the door politely.</p>

    <p>As a result, when he was about to strike with the back of his hand, he suddenly noticed that the eyeballs of the goalkeepers in the two paintings hanging in front of the door suddenly moved and were suddenly fixed on his face.</p>

    <p>This is the "Guo Shi Wushuang" that Wang Ling previously deployed to reinforce fortifications. One person holds a cannon, while the other holds a Gatling. It is a very fierce firepower combination.</p>

    <p>However, facing the pair of hanging paintings, Jingze just curled up the corners of his lips. He couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Interesting. It's such a protective method."</p>

    <p>He didn't take these two paintings seriously. He just felt that this kind of defense was very similar to the tactics of children. It was like one of the children in a fight constantly stepping on the other's toes.</p>

    <p>Only children are childish enough to step on their toes.</p>

    <p>I was about to reach out and uncover these two hanging paintings.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In an instant, there was a loud sound of artillery fire. A cannonball as big as a basketball was fired from the hanging painting and suddenly hit Jingze's chest. The huge propulsion force almost immediately took Jingze away.</p>

    <p>This power was obviously beyond Jingze's imagination. He didn't have time to react. He dug his feet into the ground and plowed out two deep ravines.</p>

    <p>Then in the open space ahead, a tiny mushroom cloud rose from the ground. A big explosion occurred.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the old man holding the Gatling painting also opened fire at this moment. Blue sparks splashed out from the painting. In just an instant, thousands of psychic bullets were fired.</p>

    <p>These bullets have their own trajectory in the air. They make seven turns and eight circles. Choose the most suitable angle to encircle them in all directions.</p>

    <p>This is the "Gatling Gun Fighting Technique." It can accurately lock every vital part of the body, leaving the locked party unable to retreat.</p>

    <p>The unparalleled national warriors cooperated tacitly. One person held a cannon and the other held a gun. Under such a tacit attack, fire suppression was formed in a short moment, turning the open space in front of the Wang family's villa into a sea of flames.</p>

    <p>"Has everything been resolved..."</p>

    <p>A full three minutes passed. The two of them stopped their hands at the same time and looked at the bright fire ahead.</p>

    <p>They had sensed deep hostility when Jingze approached before, so they decisively attacked the enemy. They thought they had killed the intruder under the intense fire suppression.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that at this moment, the sound of thunder and thunder suddenly rang out from the sea of fire ahead. Along with a golden thunder falling from the sky, the sea of fire was extinguished in an instant.</p>

    <p>There was a golden flash of light dancing on Jingze's body. It was the trace of thunder jumping on his body like a snake.</p>

    <p>The bullets fired earlier were densely suspended around him. They were all blocked by an electromagnetic force. Not a single bullet could get close to him.</p>

    <p>"How is it possible..."</p>

    <p>This time, it was Kokushi's turn to show a quiet and elegant look. They looked at each other and couldn't believe what they were seeing.</p>

    <p>This level of attack was more than enough to kill Dao God... They never expected that Jingze could stop him so easily.</p>

    <p>"Ancestor level..."</p>

    <p>Unparalleled national warriors. The faces of the two little old men holding guns instantly turned pale.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>While they were stunned, Jingze had already put on his familiar diamond gloves, pointed at the painting on the door, and snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>Instantly, a powerful force of chaos surged out from the hanging painting. It continued in an endless stream, swelling Kokushi's body to the size of a balloon.</p>

    <p>Then. Bang! Bang!...</p>

    <p>Two sounds came in succession.</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>Accompanied by heart-rending screams, the two paintings exploded instantly and disappeared completely.</p>

    <p>This scene is miserable. Kokushi is completely destroyed by Jingze's diamond gloves. It cracked on the spot.</p>

    <p>They tried to struggle, but it was in vain. The configuration given to them by Wang Ling was powerful enough. Unexpectedly, they were still unable to defeat Jingze.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the other enlightenment artifacts in the Wang family's villa were also trembling. They could clearly feel how powerful the intruder was this time.</p>

    <p>The quiet front of the Wang family's villa was under the influence of two dragonborns at this moment. It was enveloped in an atmosphere full of chilling atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang were of too low a level and had no idea of such an overwhelming power advantage. However, after hearing the explosions, strange sounds, and the screams of the unparalleled national warriors from outside the villa, they began to feel a little confused.</p>

    <p>"What can you do... the father of the house? It seems like there is a very powerful guy at the door." Mother Wang clenched Father Wang's sleeves tightly. His body couldn't help but tremble a little.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's throat rolled. He swallowed a gulp of saliva and said, "It's okay... Ling Ling has insured us... It should be fine..." In fact, even Father Wang himself didn't dare to vouch for it. After all, Wang Ling used to be in charge of the Wang family's small villa. But now Wang Ling has gone out to do errands. There is no such a giant Buddha to guard them. The couple will inevitably feel a little flustered.</p>

    <p>At this moment, 096, who transformed into a human form, suddenly came from a distance carrying Ah Nuan on her back.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan knew that these two dragonborn seemed to be coming towards her, so she was ready to fight.</p>

    <p>"Yiya!" Ah Nuan said.</p>

    <p>This time, Lord Ma personally translated for Father Wang and Mother Wang: "Nuan Zhenren said. She wants to join the war."</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan?" Mother Wang looked solemn: "But she is still so young..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang subconsciously opposed it out of consideration from the mother's point of view. In the past, it was fine to have Wang Ling following along to help. But now there are two strong enemies here. And at first glance, they are very difficult to deal with. A ruthless character.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan is still too young...</p>

    <p>I was only born a few days ago...</p>

    <p>A baby girl who is less than one month old has to fight against two dragonborns. The dragonborns are not nothing.</p>

    <p>However, what Mother Wang and Father Wang didn't expect was that Wang Nuan was stubborn and had a strong desire to fight.</p>

    <p>Without waiting for Father Wang and Mother Wang to agree, the little girl directly tugged on 096's rabbit ears, commanding 096 to jump out suddenly.</p>

    <p>She showed up directly. And her goal was clear. She came directly to Jingze.</p>

    <p>The small body sat on 096's shoulders. While 096 sprinted, he stretched out his fleshy little fist.</p>

    <p>Jingze immediately laughed. He didn't expect that Wang Nuan on the list was just a baby. And she was also an irritable baby.</p>

    <p>As soon as they met, she couldn't wait to jump out and wanted to beat him up.</p>

    <p>"Girl, your fist is like cotton. What can you do to me?" He raised the corners of his lips and opened his palms, trying to receive Wang Nuan's punch.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Then, at the moment when fist and palm touched, Jingze changed color immediately.</p>

    <p>Puff!</p>

    <p>He was shaken and flew around on the spot. He spurted out a large mouthful of blood. At the same time, his arm could not stop spasming. The pain was excruciating.</p>

    <p>Jingze turned pale with shock. It was hard to believe that a baby girl could be so destructive...</p>

    <p>And what made him even more unbelievable was...</p>

    <p>His Sequence 3 diamond glove...</p>

    <p>It actually cracked...</p>
