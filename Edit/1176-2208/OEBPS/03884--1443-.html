  <h1>Chapter 1443 Is it cooperation or routine?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As soon as Jiang Xiaoche said these words, Jiang Yingying instantly became more vigilant.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. She suddenly felt like she was being tricked.</p>

    <p>"Can't we be brothers and sisters..." Jiang Yingying asked tentatively.</p>

    <p>Pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend or something like that. She really couldn't accept it psychologically.</p>

    <p>Her heart has long been given to her classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. That's a holy place for literary couples. Where do brothers and sisters go there to perform orthopedics?" Jiang Xiaoche said with a smile while sending a text message.</p>

    <p>He found Jiang Yingying more and more interesting.</p>

    <p>As expected, besides Sun Rong, she is my second favorite girl...</p>

    <p>Then, Jiang Yingying typed out a string of words. Jiang Xiaoche almost choked when he saw it: "But... does this count as cheating?"</p>

    <p>"You are not with that Wang Ling now. What kind of cheating is that?" Jiang Xiaoche quickly replied.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was also holding his forehead.</p>

    <p>I am amazed at the brain circuit of the girl on WeChat.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang Yingying, you have to think like this. If this thing succeeds in the end, maybe you will get the upper hand." Jiang Xiaoche tried his best to encourage: "Of course. It's normal for you to have concerns about being a boyfriend and girlfriend. The worst we can do is make a three-part agreement. During the period of pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend, apart from holding hands and hugging, how about not doing any other out-of-bounds behavior?"</p>

    <p>"Ah? Do you still want to hold hands and hug..."</p>

    <p>"Of course! This is a disguised couple! Holding hands and hugging are the minimum, right? Otherwise, if others see it, wouldn't it be too fake?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche felt that this was the fastest typing speed in his life: "You just do it for Wang Ling. And I do it for Rongrong... To gain happiness. Make the sacrifice first. In fact, it is not a loss! There is a saying What do you mean? If I don't go to the earth, who will go to hell?"</p>

    <p>I can only say that Jiang Xiaoche deserves to be Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>As the chief secretary-general of the Huaguo Shuilian Group and a senior employee who is highly valued by Mr. Boss Sun, Jiang Xiaoche's ability to deceive is undeniable.</p>

    <p>A series of verbal abuses. Jiang Yingying was immediately bombarded and his body was completely bruised.</p>

    <p>"Okay! I promise you!"</p>

    <p>In the end, Jiang Yingying mustered up the courage and agreed to the conditions proposed by Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Do you have time tonight? I'll treat you to dinner." The plan succeeded. Jiang Xiaoche couldn't help but smile across the screen of his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>"You want to treat me to dinner?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. Pretending to be a couple on the weekend is a big plan. Anyway, we still have time. Why not get familiar with it first." Jiang Xiaoche said, "After dinner, I will take you shopping."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"After all, this is our first time pretending to be a couple. We both have little experience. And if we go to the ancient street, we will have to buy you a few sets of clothes. Just treat it as a meeting gift."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche said calmly.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was shocked. This man named "Ah Che" seemed to be too generous with his actions!</p>

    <p>But having such a rich teammate join the team should be a good thing.</p>

    <p>At least that's what Jiang Yingying thinks now.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's financial resources and intelligence network are both things that Jiang Yingying currently does not have.</p>

    <p>Without these two factors, she would not have enough strength to confront Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And just when she was at a loss what to do, Jiang Xiaoche appeared.</p>

    <p>It's like a savior sent by God to save him.</p>

    <p>"So Ah Che. What do you do?" Jiang Yingying became curious about the true identity of this Ah Che.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I am a private detective." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>Although it was random nonsense, Jiang Xiaoche felt that his professional status was reasonable.</p>

    <p>After all, he has followed Mr. Boss Sun for so many years. He did stock trading and other things. It was all based on his superb reasoning ability. Combined with what Mr. Boss Sun said and reverse reasoning, he successfully completed the matter.</p>

    <p>"Detective..." Jiang Yingying felt a little surprised by this answer.</p>

    <p>Since he is a detective, he must have a smart mind and strong reasoning ability.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, detectives themselves are people with certain experience and accumulated knowledge.</p>

    <p>As a person who has a special pursuit of words and literature. Thinking of Jiang Xiaoche's professional identity as a "detective", Jiang Yingying's favorable impression instantly improved.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as a rare mistake by Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thursday, December 10th.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling When I was passing by the school gate, I saw Heavenly Dao talking to the old pancake and fruit man at the gate.</p>

    <p>With the help of the monk, Heavenly Dao successfully became the captain of the school guard of Number 60 High School. And now he has successfully become familiar with the old man at the door.</p>

    <p>This old pancake and fruit man has been at the school gate for many years. He is a poor man. In order to raise medical expenses for his wife, he borrowed a loan shark.</p>

    <p>Then because of the violent collection of loan sharks, his wife's condition deteriorated rapidly.</p>

    <p>Over the years, the old man has paid off his debts and repaid evil with kindness. He will distribute half of his income every day and leave it to those in need.</p>

    <p>At Number 60 High School. This is an old story.</p>

    <p>Not really a secret.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao found out about this not long after he took office.</p>

    <p>So just this morning, the old man heard that the loan shark company that used to violently collect debts exploded due to a gas leak...</p>

    <p>And what a coincidence. It killed the big guy who came to the door violently to collect money.</p>

    <p>"Uncle, is there anyone else you dislike? Just tell me." Death Heavenly Dao said while eating pancake fruit.</p>

    <p>The old man wiped his sweat: "No. No..."</p>

    <p>Even if I have it, I don't dare to say it!</p>

    <p>This is so scary...</p>

    <p>But he felt that this was mostly a coincidence.</p>

    <p>After all, these things about myself are not secrets. Everyone knows.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the gas leak was an accident. The police have also identified it. There can be no mistake.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for caring so much, Little Wang." The old man spread the pancakes. His face was filled with helplessness. He knew that the young man in front of him had the name on his ID card: Wang Shi.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect it to be so evil. To die with a god of death...</p>

    <p>"You're so polite. I just went back last night to get a puncture done. I didn't expect something really happened." Heavenly Dao laughed.</p>

    <p>I saw two people chatting. Wang Ling took the initiative to walk over. He seemed to want to eat pancakes today.</p>

    <p>As soon as he saw it was Wang Ling, the old man immediately spread out the pancakes in a familiar manner: "Good morning, classmate Wang! Just follow the old rules. Double eggs and minced noodles."</p>

    <p>This is a special way of eating that is unique to Wang Ling. The old man is also very willing to make it for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because this way of eating is quite popular now.</p>

    <p>Generally, pancakes are just stuffed with fried dough sticks, shortbread and the like. However, the crispy flour crumbs can add a different crispiness to the pancakes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is waiting for pancakes.</p>

    <p>At this time, he saw a purple-eyed girl with long black hair stepping out of a black car. Her tight-fitting black stockings and gothic-style skirt were particularly eye-catching.</p>

    <p>"Does this way of eating taste delicious? Then uncle, please make me a similar one." The purple-eyed girl said with a cold expression.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't squint his eyes. With only his peripheral vision, he spotted the conspicuous logo on the black car.</p>

    <p>That is the symbol of the Jiugong family.</p>
