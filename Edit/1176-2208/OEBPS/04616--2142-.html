  <h1>Chapter 2142 Infinite Defense</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Since Qin Zhong gradually became familiar with his koi attributes, he has continued to develop based on his luck. Bullets are ineffective to Qin Zhong. If there is no strong luck to suppress him, the ballistic trajectory will be lost once he gets close. Straight off track.</p>

    <p>Those who shoot him will also be dubbed "Masters of Body Drawing."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong has used mechanisms to fight through many wars in the universe. During the war, he was unarmed. He didn't wear any protective gear. He rushed directly to the front.</p>

    <p>People thought he was here to die. Little did he know that this was the strongest human shield that was extremely lucky. He rushed directly to the front and changed the trajectories of all the ballistics aimed at him.</p>

    <p>So will precision-guided nuclear bombs work on Qin Zhong?</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, a weapon with a wide area of destruction like this would be useless even if it misses. The shock wave of a nuclear warhead is very strong, and there is also powerful radiation.</p>

    <p>Even if it doesn't fall on top of your head, it will be directly vaporized if you get a little closer.</p>

    <p>But when you encounter Qin Zhong, even precision guidance will fail.</p>

    <p>Maybe everyone will have such an experience. When mentioning a football, you will occasionally kick the football high, but when the football falls, it still hits your head.</p>

    <p>So even if it is a nuclear warhead, it will be helpless when encountering Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Those who once tried to use nuclear bombs against Qin Zhong all made various "mistakes" with extremely low probability after the nuclear bombs were launched, and then landed in their own base.</p>

    <p>In the weapons store in Science and Technology City, the boss was talking loudly. Everyone around him also looked dull. No one expected to be at such a close distance.</p>

    <p>The boss can actually miss with a sniper rifle...</p>

    <p>The barrel of this gun is nearly two meters long...</p>

    <p>In other words, the actual shooting distance is less than ten meters at all.</p>

    <p>As a result, this bullet hit Qin Zhong's earlobe.</p>

    <p>"Boss, do you mean what you say?" Qin Zhong looked at the boss calmly and said.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" The boss didn't believe in evil: "Let's do it again! Don't you dare! As long as I miss, you can choose a weapon! But I'm going to hit. You don't have any. Can't take it away!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong's original purpose was to equip Xiang Yi with an initial weapon. But obviously the owner of the weapon shop was completely over it.</p>

    <p>A normal person would know that the owner of the weapons store wanted to default on his debt. But when Qin Zhong heard this, he immediately laughed. At the same time, his eyes flashed.</p>

    <p>--There is such a good thing!</p>

    <p>The key is that after the first bullet was fired, more and more people gathered around the weapons store. There were NPCs and many other players. Everyone was attracted by this strange bet.</p>

    <p>Only Xiang Yi's mouth twitched when he saw it. He covered his face and smiled bitterly with a helpless expression.</p>

    <p>He is convinced by Qin Zhong. Really respect!</p>

    <p>Koi fish can really do whatever they want!</p>

    <p>So just half an hour later, Qin Zhong ransacked the entire weapons store in accordance with the bet he made with the boss.</p>

    <p>The wall panels of the weapon shop were smashed into pieces by the boss. As a result, not a single shot hit.</p>

    <p>With so many weapons on my body, there is not enough space in my backpack.</p>

    <p>So Qin Zhong had no choice but to negotiate with his boss: "Let's do this, boss. I only want this sniper rifle. The remaining weapons. You pay some money to recycle my weapons."</p>

    <p>"..." The boss was about to cry but had no tears left.</p>

    <p>He is a weapons store owner. He has actually reduced himself to the point where he has to recycle his own weapons.</p>

    <p>Finally. The pair of Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi got a full 2 million taels of silver and a blue-quality sniper rifle at the beginning of the Science and Technology City.</p>

    <p>This is the best sniper rifle currently available in this weapons store. Generally speaking, it is enough for Xiang Yi to use for a while.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this is just an overused weapon in the early stages. The blue quality is already very good.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi smiled bitterly: "I didn't expect that. When neither of us has completed the novice tasks, the starting capital is actually two million. How do you plan to use this money?"</p>

    <p>Yes. Xiang Yi has already called Qin Zhong brother. He just changed his title... Originally Qin Zhong was older than him. In addition, this series of operations made Xiang Yi extremely impressed.</p>

    <p>No wonder he applied to compete with Qin Zhong before. Qin Zhong always refused...</p>

    <p>It's not that I don't want to fight him. I'm clearly trying to give him a leg up.</p>

    <p>It's not that he can't beat Qin Zhong. It's that he may not be able to hit Qin Zhong at all!</p>

    <p>And we have to deal with Qin Zhong. It is obviously unrealistic to use Nine Yang Divine Sword for long-range sniping. If it is close combat, there may be a chance to agree...</p>

    <p>But now after seeing Qin Zhong's lucky moves, Xiang Yi felt that he had given up resistance in his heart and completely gave up the idea of competing with Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>However, as Xiang Yi analyzed, both of them were new players who had not completed the novice tasks. They directly received a blue quality sniper rifle and 2 million credits at the beginning.</p>

    <p>If you carry a huge amount of money with you and your level is not high enough, you can easily be targeted directly.</p>

    <p>When they walked out of the weapon shop, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi felt that many players had focused their attention on them. Although the public areas in the science and technology city were safe enough, there were also blind spots.</p>

    <p>Like inside some buildings, it is not within the patrol range of the mechanical eye police. Whenever they walk in, they are likely to be directly targeted by some players who want to rob them.</p>

    <p>Unless they stay in public areas all their lives and accept the protection of the police with mechanical eyes, otherwise once they lose the protection of the mechanical eyes, they are always at risk of being robbed.</p>

    <p>Many people thought they were eyeing two fat sheep. But in fact, this was within Qin Zhong's expectation.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that big trees attract wind.</p>

    <p>He chose to trade with the boss in the weapons store. He asked the boss to "cheaply" recycle the weapons he won. His purpose was to let some players with evil intentions focus on him.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong also teamed up for a while. The two people almost had the same tacit understanding at this time. Xiang Yi cooperated with Qin Zhong throughout the process. Even though he knew that it might be dangerous if there were no mechanical eyes around, he still followed Qin Zhong in. In a building.</p>

    <p>And soon, they were targeted by a group of players. These players thought they had seized the opportunity. After the two entered the building, they followed them directly. Then they switched weapons one after another.</p>

    <p>They still looked like legal citizens on the street. The moment they entered this building, they immediately became gangsters!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please pay attention. www.uukanshu.net Surround these two fat sheep! Don't let any of them go!" one of the people shouted.</p>

    <p>The result was beyond the man's expectation. He found that Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong didn't hide at all...</p>

    <p>Instead, he sighed, looked at Xiang Yi and said, "Are you sure? The two of us will surround ten of them."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "Not sure. But you can try."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "Kill them all."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "Is it okay?"</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I called the police just after I came in. They were the ones who started it. The police with mechanical eyes made a decision. In this building, we have unlimited rights of defense."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong raised his lips and said with a smile: "In other words, even if we kill them all, it will be fine."</p>
