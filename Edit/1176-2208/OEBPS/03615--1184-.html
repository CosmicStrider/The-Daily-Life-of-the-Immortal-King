  <h1>Chapter 1184 Ghost Ax Spirit Mother became a fraud?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The huge shadow takes on the shape of a steel toad. The whole body is made of copper and iron walls. The body shape can be controlled by Er Ha. Because he is fighting in the stalactite cave, Er Ha has shrunk the size of the fortress as much as possible. But it still looks impressive. Feel shocked.</p>

    <p>This is a movable fortress. It is indestructible and has fierce firepower. There are no fewer than dozens of turrets of different calibers erected on the back alone! These turrets are all energy storage. It requires a certain amount of spiritual power to be entrenched in the body to accumulate cannonballs.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has never summoned a shadow before. The main reason is to save psychic energy. He has been concentrating psychic energy for his shadow. Now it finally comes in use.</p>

    <p>The moment Toad Fortress appeared, the entire body of the fortress immediately released a dazzling light, washing away all the nearby shadows! - All of this was within the scope of Er Ha's calculations.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue's shadow ability is a shadow bomb. It can be implanted by touching the shadow. This ability is tricky. But if you can freely operate the lighting effects of the fortress, Er Ha can accurately control your shadow to always stay on your body. The edge of the foot. Instead of forming a long shape and projecting it.</p>

    <p>"You can try. My fortress psychic cannon is faster. Or your shadow bomb can hit me first!" At this time, Er Ha maintained a long distance from Jiang Yingyue. Defense and range were his. Advantages of photography.</p>

    <p>Even if Jiang Yingyue breaks the jar and wants to use the clone technique to explode here, Er Ha can instantly swallow Wang Zhen and Xiao Yin next to him into his impregnable fortress.</p>

    <p>Although the bomb was powerful, it was still within the defense range of his fortress. Even if he was injured, as long as Xiao Yin could give him a few drops of the holy beast's blood, he could be healed instantly.</p>

    <p>"The terrain here. Are you going to use artillery fire on me? I'm afraid it's not good for you." Jiang Yingyue frowned slightly. The green-haired dog in front of her was more difficult to deal with than she imagined.</p>

    <p>What's more surprising to Jiang Yingyue is that Er Ha actually also possesses the power of Shadow...</p>

    <p>From Jiang Yingyue's perspective, the situation became more and more interesting.</p>

    <p>"I can use as many as thirty types of artillery shells. Naturally, there are special artillery shells for this narrow terrain." Er Ha did not want to explain too much. In his opinion, the battle was already won or lost.</p>

    <p>His "annihilation bomb" has the ability to automatically track. When it touches an object that needs to be destroyed, it will not cause a big explosion. Instead, it will produce a strong acid that can instantly dissolve a person into a puddle of acid water.</p>

    <p>But to be honest. Er Ha didn't want to kill Jiang Yingyue directly...</p>

    <p>The mystery of Mother Wang has not been completely solved in Er Ha's opinion. If Jiang Yingyue is killed here, I am afraid that there will be no evidence in the future. It will completely become an unsolved mystery!</p>

    <p>The most likely guess now is that someone is currently using Mother Wang's identity as the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother to "deceive"... and Jiang Yingyue is one of the victims who was deceived among the countless killers.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you haven't made up your mind to kill me yet. This is a taboo in battle." At this time, Jiang Yingyue laughed stubbornly. She grinned, revealing her white teeth. A rather sickly expression emerged. Show some rosiness.</p>

    <p>The next moment, her figure moved quickly. Er Ha will never forget this scene. It was a desperate gesture of giving up everything.</p>

    <p>As the legendary third epic killer on the killer ranking list, Jiang Yingyue's ability to seize opportunities is far beyond the twin sisters of the Shadow Stream Organization. She strikes fiercely and decisively, without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>"Nine kills with wind and thunder!"</p>

    <p>She threw the dagger in her hand and quickly formed a seal while the dagger was flying in the air for a few seconds!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the dagger was thrown, lightning flashed, wind and thunder surged around. Thunder exploded, shaking the eardrums!</p>

    <p>It's all in the blink of an eye!</p>

    <p>"Tiny trick." Er Ha controlled the fortress in a defensive posture. The dagger did not penetrate Er Ha's solid armor.</p>

    <p>Nine Kills with Wind and Thunder. This technique is not a high-level assassination spell. And the most important thing is. Er Ha also discovered that the dagger used by Jiang Yingyue was of very high quality. Not only did it not penetrate the wall of his fortress, it was actually on the outermost layer. The fortress's defensive light film was broken.</p>

    <p>"You should have noticed. Yes. This is indeed an ordinary dagger. It doesn't even have an edge. But as long as it can achieve the effect, no matter how ordinary a dagger is, it is still very deadly." Jiang Yingyue laughed. She walked step by step in the direction of Er Ha, as if she was not afraid of the threat of bombardment from Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"You..." And it was only then that Er Ha finally seemed to have discovered the key to the problem!</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue's Nine Kills of Wind and Thunder was not intended to kill him from the beginning! Even Jiang Yingyue had no intention of killing him with this move!</p>

    <p>She was using the high-frequency electric light formed by the Nine Kills of Wind and Thunder in a short period of time to find the angle, thereby controlling the length of the shadow under his feet!</p>

    <p>This time may only be less than 3 seconds. But he has already entered Jiang Yingyue's range unknowingly!</p>

    <p>Therefore, the opponent's goal from the very beginning was not to use {Wind and Thunder Nine Kills} to kill him. Instead, he used electric light to touch his shadow and set up bombs!</p>

    <p>"Did you finally find it?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue smiled: I am a dead person. It is not a loss for me to change one pair. You have already lost."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue was very confident in the explosive power of the shadow bomb. Even the steel fortress was impregnable. But if the shadow exploded from the inside, no matter how strong the external defense was, it would be of no use.</p>

    <p>"This is a time bomb. In one minute, you will be wiped out. So, do you have any last words?" Jiang Yingyue asked.</p>

    <p>"I do have one last question." Er Ha's voice was unexpectedly calm: "What I want to know is. Did Ghost Ax Spirit Mother receive any benefits when she agreed to duel with you?"</p>

    <p>"Benefits?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue smiled: "That is the ancestor of the killer world. The predecessor of all our killers. Isn't it appropriate to give some tuition before the duel?"</p>

    <p>"So. You gave me money?" Er Ha twitched the corner of her mouth.</p>

    <p>"As long as I can survive the duel with her, all the abilities I learned during the duel can be used by me. Although it is a pity that I died in the battle later, I have no regrets."</p>

    <p>"The tuition. How much is it..."</p>

    <p>"Not much. One call only costs 100 million. I thought I wouldn't die and even got a membership card. Members only need 50 million to get one call."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue counted with her fingers: "I remember... I seemed to have charged 1 billion in one go?"</p>

    <p>"You actually recharged money..." Er Ha, Wang Zhen, and Xiao Yin looked shocked.</p>

    <p>Now they can be sure that this ghost-axe spirit mother who is always looking for a fight... is 100% a liar!</p>
