  <h1>Chapter 1565 It's not necessary</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Before the start of this competition, Sakai Kazuya actually debated for a long time whether to join Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>His academic performance has always been very good. He has never made any mistakes. He is a child that makes his parents very worry-free.</p>

    <p>As the second eldest child in the family, Sakai Kazuya, who is still young, has always been favored by the head of the Sakai family, Naru Sakai.</p>

    <p>He is a standard "other people's child." He has grown up with all kinds of praises from childhood to adulthood.</p>

    <p>However, just a dozen hours ago, everything seemed to have broken down with a cooperation contract signed by the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>His trouble-loving eldest brother, Sakai Toyotoshi, suddenly gained his father's praise and favor.</p>

    <p>This made Sakai Kazuya feel uncomfortable from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>He was very clear about Sakai Toyotoshi's intelligence. With his elder brother's little thought, it was absolutely impossible for him to win the attention of the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group by relying on the pot of purple cherries.</p>

    <p>So here comes the question. Who gave his eldest brother the idea?</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya carefully analyzed the changes that had occurred in his elder brother, and finally came to the conclusion that everything was because of his elder brother's relationship with the Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>It's obviously just a literary exchange organization. It can be so charming that it can cause a huge change in a person's IQ.</p>

    <p>This forced Sakai Kazuya to examine the importance of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Since there are benefits to joining Gray Cult, he can't lag behind...</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his grades in cultural classes were excellent.</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya joined the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch at the speed of light with excellent results.</p>

    <p>But what Sakai Kazuya didn't expect was that in today's game, the first person he drew was the legendary Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>So now, the situation is very clear.</p>

    <p>Since as long as you comply with Houlang Sang's wishes, you can please the young lady.</p>

    <p>You must lose the next game!</p>

    <p>And not only do you have to lose. You also have to lose beautifully!</p>

    <p>Lose so that others cannot see that you are cheating.</p>

    <p>After this incident with Sakai Toyotoshi, Sakai Kazuya finally understood.</p>

    <p>School honors are bullshit. He's got so many awards. He could have used it as wallpaper... It's not as good as Sakai Toyotoshi's luck in the end. A huge family profit.</p>

    <p>"Father... Watch this... It's just to be a lickspittle... I can do it..."</p>

    <p>Before going on stage, Sakai Kazuya felt very complicated.</p>

    <p>But he was already prepared to lose to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It is said that...</p>

    <p>Certificates are valuable. Honors are even more valuable.</p>

    <p>If you go the dog-licking route, you can throw away both.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Finally it was Wang Ling's turn to start the match with Sakai Kazuya.</p>

    <p>Due to the nature of this closed-door match, video recording is prohibited throughout the venue.</p>

    <p>No one could see what was going on inside.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming was able to use brain waves to project the images inside through remote sensing into the minds of Sun Rong, Zhai Yin, Jisaki and others.</p>

    <p>"Take it easy..." Zhai Yin was actually very worried about Wang Ming's condition.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that I found that Wang Ming has become very excited in the past few days. I am worried that Wang Ming's brain will work too fast and cause an overheating reaction.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ming's expression turned out to be much calmer than he expected.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about me. I feel like my brain has improved a lot recently." Wang Ming said with a smile.</p>

    <p>After all, after he got a girlfriend, he had a human brain-charging pad around him. The kind that charged for five minutes and lasted two hours of talk... was enough to make him feel refreshed.</p>

    <p>The object of Wang Ling's first game. He is a member of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>This is actually good news.</p>

    <p>As long as Sakai Kazuya isn't stupid, he won't be too desperate.</p>

    <p>If it is to release water, it will actually be more beneficial to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because it can help Wang Ling save a lot of disposable Talisman. Advance to the next round.</p>

    <p>However, in Jisaki's view, there are still technical difficulties in releasing the water.</p>

    <p>Although it is a closed-door match, the referee is not a fool either...</p>

    <p>In regular games, the referee balls have built-in anti-match-fixing functions. It can be judged through the details of the battle whether the two people in the battle have a match-fixing phenomenon. This allows for intelligent evaluation.</p>

    <p>If it is judged as match-fixing, both parties will be disqualified from the competition...</p>

    <p>In other words, if Sakai Kazuya sincerely wants to lose, he must also deceive the referee.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Jisaki is actually a little worried deep down in his heart: "Brother Xiaoer, if Sakai Kazuya doesn't act like him, Houlang Sang will be implicated."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about this. There will be no problem." Wang Ming smiled as always.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ming has already studied the form of refereeing match-fixing.</p>

    <p>Before the start of each game, the referee's ball will be given priority through the system to automatically measure the combat power of both sides. The resulting value will be combined with the situation of the entire game to make a decision.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, if the side with the higher initial value loses to the side with the lower value, there is a 70% chance that the match is being faked.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the judgment mechanism of this fake match is actually based on the initial numerical value.</p>

    <p>Here. Wang Ling wants to win. Sakai Kazuya wants to lose.</p>

    <p>And the initial value of Wang Ling is even under the "multiple seals" situation. Is it more than a trillion points higher than Sakai Kazuya?</p>

    <p>Therefore, the basic determination of match-fixing was not established from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Just go through the process normally.</p>

    <p>At least. That's what Wang Ling thought before officially meeting Sakai Kazuya...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a fully enclosed independent fighting arena. Wang Ling and Sakai Kazuya face to face.</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya looked very nervous. The sweat on his cheeks had been rolling down since the beginning of the game. It continued to drip on the ground.</p>

    <p>In the 200-square-meter room, there were six referee balls floating in the air, monitoring the battle from all directions.</p>

    <p>"Six balls..."</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya knows it very well.</p>

    <p>If you want to fight against match-fixing, you must deceive these six referee balls.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>As the six referee balls gradually unfolded in the void, the staggered psychic light rays unfolded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sakai Kazuya both know it.</p>

    <p>The initial basic combat strength determination is about to begin.</p>

    <p>This is the key to determining whether there is suspicion of match-fixing.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked into the void nonchalantly, waiting for the referee to make a decision.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sakai Kazuya's expression looked a little panicked.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know what the combat power value of Wang Ling is.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we dare not act rashly.</p>

    <p>And. His main concern is</p>

    <p>In case your combat power value is higher than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Once you lose the game, it is very likely to be judged as a fake match, and you will be eliminated together with the Houlang Sang in front of you.</p>

    <p>It would come to mind that there are many rumors about "mascot" about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sakai Kazuya became more and more afraid that his initial value judgment would really be higher than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>--We must not let this happen!</p>

    <p>He Sakai Kazuya.</p>

    <p>We must carry Houlang Sang to the finals!</p>

    <p>So. After making up my mind.</p>

    <p>Before Sakai Kazuya judged that the light was hitting him, he slapped himself hard on the forehead!</p>

    <p>Poof! A large mouthful of blood came out of Sakai Kazuya's mouth in an exaggerated roar like a fountain.</p>

    <p>For Sakai Kazuya, this was a helpless move.</p>

    <p>Because he is worried that his initial value is higher than Wang Ling. So he can only adopt this method. Weaken himself through self-mutilation.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling feels that.</p>

    <p>This move.</p>

    <p>No need to...</p>
