  <h1>Chapter 1484 Wang Ming's Data Analysis</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A whole sack of White Rabbit toffees. This is already Wang Ling's stock at the bottom of the box.</p>

    <p>However, these candies are just for Wang Ling himself to be a bit too tough sometimes. Maybe Sun Rong can be more useful now.</p>

    <p>Previously, he and Jin Deng co-starred in that big scene. He deliberately made Peng Xiren think that he had successfully recovered Dao Ancestor Wang's Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Later, a big explosion occurred in the sealed land in the Infinite Galaxy. The entire sealed land was destroyed.</p>

    <p>The terrifying creatures and Peng Xiren sealed inside. Their auras completely disappeared. Not even a trace was left.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally thought that they would not die so easily. They had been waiting for Peng Xiren's next move. Unexpectedly, he actually expected it.</p>

    <p>As for why he can avoid his own visits.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is very likely to be related to the mysterious ancient black stone.</p>

    <p>The radiation power of that ancient stone is very strong. Even in the cosmic space that Peng Xiren considers his home, under the healing light of those stars, he still has difficulty persevering.</p>

    <p>But even so, as long as the ability of the ancient stone can be properly utilized, it is no problem to use the ancient stone as a signal jammer with Peng Xiren's wisdom.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling feels that this is probably an act of injuring the enemy by one thousand and damaging himself by eight hundred.</p>

    <p>This Peng Xiren may indeed have used the power of the black ancient stone to create a "shielded space" to magically disappear into the universe.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. As long as Peng Xiren stays in this "shielded space" for one more day, all his abilities will be affected by the black ancient stone and be directly blocked...</p>

    <p>Of course this is just Wang Ling's guess.</p>

    <p>But it should be...</p>

    <p>Before returning to the Wang family's villa, Wang Ling stopped by Wang Ming's research institute.</p>

    <p>He wanted something from Wang Ming. So Wang Ming just took the opportunity to collect a wave of the latest data of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was still wearing the same white coat. He took out a syringe and handed it to Wang Ling. He was preparing to collect blood samples: "This needle is specially made. But it's still the same old rules. You can do it yourself. I'm rough. It's thick. I definitely won't be able to penetrate it."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling obediently took the syringe.</p>

    <p>Recently, Wang Ming is working on the development of an improved "Wang Ling Number 3 Intelligent Humanoid Integrated Mecha."</p>

    <p>This is the latest third-generation mecha. Its performance has been greatly improved compared to the previous two generations. It also incorporates the space teleportation function.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming will set up this third-generation mecha in a container with a transmission function. If necessary, the transmission can be received remotely through satellite positioning. It can be used at any time.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the third-generation mecha does not need to be worn by oneself at all. Wang Ming used the latest space compression technology to implant chips in his pores.</p>

    <p>When the third-generation mecha lands on the ground, the parts of each part will be like a puzzle, automatically installed and wrapped around his body.</p>

    <p>And from summoning to being fully armed, the whole process doesn't even take five seconds.</p>

    <p>Knowledge changes power. Technology can also counterattack cultivation...Wang Ling really feel that I have learned a lot.</p>

    <p>The blood sample collection was completed. Wang Ling handed the syringe back. There was no need for sterilized cotton to stop bleeding and pressure.</p>

    <p>Almost as soon as the needle was pulled out, the needle hole of Wang Ling disappeared at the same time. The healing speed was amazing.</p>

    <p>"So. The boy named Peng's new move is to find a bad alien to deal with you?" Wang Ming asked while putting the collected blood samples into the container.</p>

    <p>"It's Sun Rong." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it the same as dealing with Miss Rong? It's not the same as dealing with you." Wang Ming smiled evilly.</p>

    <p>"It's different." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p>"You're in a hurry." Wang Ming persisted.</p>

    <p>"No." Wang Ling's face remained calm.</p>

    <p>"You haven't talked to me so much." Wang Ming laughed.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood up without saying a word. He was going to wake up Zhai Yin in the sleeping cabin next door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming saw him and grabbed him: "Don't worry, brother! I'm just kidding... You probably don't want to wake up your sister Zhai Yin to make you a midnight snack, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought carefully.</p>

    <p>Finally, he sat down again obediently. "That's right." Wang Ming bared his teeth and smiled. The smile was still as warm as the spring breeze. There was a hint of guilt in the sunshine.</p>

    <p>Such a temperament. Wang Ling feels that only Wang Ming has it.</p>

    <p>There is a saying called "extremely smart." Wang Ming's brain is so powerful. His hair is still thick. This is really amazing for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>100% hair transplant done...</p>

    <p>With Wang Ming's methods, he can even build something as powerful as a third-generation mecha. Isn't it just a waste of time to get an automatic hair transplanter?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembers that Wang Ying voluntarily separated from himself before. Because of the use of forbidden techniques, Wang Ying's hair fell off irreversibly.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ying is back. After the shadow is re-bound to himself, the fallen hair grows back.</p>

    <p>If one day Wang Ying wants to completely cut off the relationship with him, his hair will still fall out... I'm afraid that Wang Ming's help will be inevitable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's blood sample cost analysis has always been complicated.</p>

    <p>In the past, you had to wait several days for complete results.</p>

    <p>After continuous accumulation of experience, Wang Ming now uses a machine to analyze the blood sample data of Wang Ling. He uses another set of programs that he made up himself.</p>

    <p>Now it only takes less than half an hour to analyze the data.</p>

    <p>"Wait. By the way, I'll take a look at another thing you brought."</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ming took away a test tube made of special material that was sealed on the table.</p>

    <p>Stored here are the ashes of the Silver Horned Man collected previously by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Already crushed to ashes? This girl Rong is so powerful now. Even this alien can't beat her." Wang Ming was surprised at Sun Rong's current growth.</p>

    <p>There is only a little bit of this ashes. It was refined by Wang Ling in the air after Sun Rong left the abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>"Does he look like a silver-horned man? The two silver horns on his head are curled up like a cow. And he also has a tail." Wang Ming searched his memory. He felt that there was no such alien creature in his memory.</p>

    <p>Because Guo Ping from the institute is now an international diplomat establishing diplomatic relations with extraterrestrials. And since Heavenly Dao began to cooperate with the earth, all aspects of alien data have basically been collected.</p>

    <p>All data are shared in the large database of the International Cultivator Alliance.</p>

    <p>And with a large database, it should not be difficult to find out what the Silver Horned Man looked like before he evolved, as long as DNA gene comparison is performed.</p>

    <p>"This search is faster than analyzing your blood sample. You will know it in ten minutes."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming held his chin up and was looking forward to it. What on earth is this Silver Horned Man...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. On the other side.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun is on the phone with Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>In the meantime. He plans to report back on some situations...</p>
