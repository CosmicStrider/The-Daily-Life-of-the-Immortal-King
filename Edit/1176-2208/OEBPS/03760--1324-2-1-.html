  <h1>Chapter 1324 Ban matryoshka dolls!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha is very familiar with the method of using the soul to escape from the golden cicada.</p>

    <p>Now that he recalled it carefully, he even felt a little sympathy for the spirit of the groundhog wandering nearby.</p>

    <p>Because they were all poor little people who had been killed repeatedly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling The "Friends of Animals" label cannot be removed.</p>

    <p>The only difference is.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha are each other's childhood shadows.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the groundhog. Only the groundhog has a larger psychological shadow area.</p>

    <p>In order not to alert the snake.</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw that Wang Ling had already left first.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, its original choice was correct.</p>

    <p>Although he was killed by Wang Ling several times.</p>

    <p>But follow Wang Ling. There is indeed meat to eat!</p>

    <p>The Earth upgrade Tribulation Transcendence is about to begin.</p>

    <p>Er Ha calculated the time. There are still less than 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>But it has accurately sensed a certain soul that is lurking and ready to move...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. On a sand dune in the Desert of Dead Bones.</p>

    <p>Gray Mist Lord stared ahead at the core area that was about to receive the Chaos Impact.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>He didn't really die...</p>

    <p>Although the body was destroyed, the soul still escaped.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is terrible.</p>

    <p>It is famously said to adjust the time "a hundred million points."</p>

    <p>As a result, he was taken directly to the earth four billion years ago and beaten...</p>

    <p>The privilege left to him by Dao Ancestor is indeed resurrection at full status.</p>

    <p>But after this resurrection reaches a certain number of times, he will lose control of the resurrection point.</p>

    <p>He must pass through the Abandoned Land. The location of his next resurrection will be determined by Cat in the Abandoned Land.</p>

    <p>And the Cat in the Abandoned Land was unhappy with him...</p>

    <p>He will definitely be sent to that scary boy!</p>

    <p>When the time comes, it will be all in vain if he is really resurrected!</p>

    <p>So after weighing the balance, Mr. Gray Mist made a bold decision...</p>

    <p>He decided to keep his soul state. There was no need to resurrect so quickly!</p>

    <p>However, in the soul state, his own combat power will be greatly reduced. In addition, the passage of time will also weaken his power...</p>

    <p>A full 4 billion years have passed.</p>

    <p>Now his soul energy is already fragile.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, everything in front of him gave Mr. Gray Mist hope for life.</p>

    <p>--He saw a chaos egg that was about to break out of its shell!</p>

    <p>As long as he seizes the body at the moment when the new divine beast breaks out of the egg shell, he will become a brand new divine beast!</p>

    <p>So. He has a new one!</p>

    <p>Not only can he regain his strength, but more importantly, he can also get rid of the prairie dog body that has troubled him for a long time!</p>

    <p>It should be noted that this monk's egg has not hatched in 300 lifetimes.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, you know that there must be a very rare and precious beast inside!</p>

    <p>"Ah! I have finally waited for this day!" On the sand dune, the soul woodchuck was moved.</p>

    <p>The tears from my soul couldn't stop pouring out.</p>

    <p>Finally. He no longer has to be a groundhog!</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Soul Marmot felt a chill running down his spine.</p>

    <p>"That's not right. Why is it so cold?"</p>

    <p>The soul groundhog shuddered all over.</p>

    <p>When he turned around, he suddenly found an extremely long tongue with mucus in the distance launching a surprise attack on his back!</p>

    <p>Although in the soul state, the prairie dog's soul is extremely weak, but it still has basic reaction capabilities.</p>

    <p>His reaction was quicker than Er Ha imagined.</p>

    <p>Almost subconsciously, he turned to one side and escaped Er Ha's surprise attack.</p>

    <p>A full 4 billion years...</p>

    <p>In order to maintain the power of this remnant soul and ensure that his remnant soul remains alive, the prairie dog has gone through disasters... and escaped death many times. He has developed amazing reflexes.</p>

    <p>I can't beat you. I can't hide from you!</p>

    <p>The upgrade of the earth has begun soon.</p>

    <p>In order to give the soul time to seize the body and terminate the contract, the groundhog's first reaction is naturally to avoid fighting.</p>

    <p>Er Ha also didn't expect that this woodchuck's reaction ability was so fast...</p>

    <p>Obviously there is only a trace of the soul left!</p>

    <p>This is an ability that has been developed through many raids!</p>

    <p>Er Ha complained in his heart.</p>

    <p>But for the remnant soul of this groundhog, it is bound to win!</p>

    <p>This is the number one beast under Dao Ancestor Wang!</p>

    <p>If it can be swallowed, even if it is just a trace of the remaining soul, its own strength will increase tremendously in a short period of time!</p>

    <p>"Oops...this soul is so delicious!" Er Ha couldn't wait. His eyes were full of longing.</p>

    <p>The scent of the woodchuck's soul exuded made its saliva drool uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>When it saw the remnant soul of the groundhog, it ran away nimbly. It quickly followed up and said, "Don't run! Stop for me!"</p>

    <p>"Damn... at this time..."</p>

    <p>There is only one last step left before the soul is taken away.</p>

    <p>The groundhog never expected that he would encounter such a formidable enemy at this last moment.</p>

    <p>Why is this Akita's hair green! It's also fluorescent! And it can even stick out its tongue as long as a toad...</p>

    <p>As for the origin of Er Ha, Marmot is not clear.</p>

    <p>But since the other party came for his remnant soul, it was obvious that the person who came was evil.</p>

    <p>Less than 10 minutes left!</p>

    <p>As long as he can delay it until the moment when the chaos impact falls, he can win!</p>

    <p>When the time comes, wait until he enters the body of this divine beast.</p>

    <p>Even if that divine beast is just a baby, as long as he has a physical body, he can summon the gray mist of chaos!</p>

    <p>With that layer of power blessing.</p>

    <p>Not to mention just a green-haired dog!</p>

    <p>Ha. Just don't meet Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He has nothing to fear from anyone here!</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha's difficulty also surprised the groundhog.</p>

    <p>His soul state has been very hidden. But this green-haired dog seemed to be able to smell him. It kept chasing him!</p>

    <p>"Don't run! Let me take a lick!" Er Ha ran over from a distance. He quickly stuck out his tongue in his direction and tried to suck him directly into his belly. He kept making "suck, suck, suck" sounds.</p>

    <p>Damn! This is still a licking dog!</p>

    <p>The groundhog couldn't help but scolded his mother.</p>

    <p>He has never been bullied like that by a holy beast...</p>

    <p>The woodchuck quickly manipulated his soul to dive and hide himself in the sand.</p>

    <p>And Er Ha's digging speed was also ridiculously fast. He was chasing after him relentlessly.</p>

    <p>There is an old saying that tells a dog to meddle in its own business.</p>

    <p>The prairie dog feels that he will live a long time.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this sentence actually came true for me!</p>

    <p>--Ahhhh!</p>

    <p>He was roaring inside.</p>

    <p>Still a little short of it!</p>

    <p>There's still a little time left!</p>

    <p>Then he can have a real, brand new one!</p>

    <p>At this time, the sky is over the Desert of Dead Bones.</p>

    <p>Both Marmot and Er Ha. have already felt that an inexplicable and huge spiritual energy is beginning to gather!</p>

    <p>Chaos Onslaught is about to begin!</p>

    <p>The countdown phase has now officially entered.</p>

    <p>At this point Er Ha gave up the chase.</p>

    <p>But this does not mean that it has given up action.</p>

    <p>In this situation, there is no point in continuing to chase. It is better to change a new strategy!</p>

    <p>About thirty seconds passed.</p>

    <p>In the sky, a huge purple thundercloud gathered. A terrifying red light erupted from it! Like a devil's eye, staring at the earth!</p>

    <p>Chaos Blast. About to begin!</p>

    <p>The monk stood in front of the Chaos Egg. He turned his prayer beads and recited Buddhist scriptures silently.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand. The chaos guidance device was activated instantly.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Countless tubes burst out with golden light in an instant. Finally, the chaotic egg suddenly surged towards the core of the device!</p>

    <p>The monk has tested all this process over and over hundreds of times before, ensuring that everything is foolproof!</p>

    <p>And at the moment when the golden light converged on the Chaos Egg!</p>

    <p>Rumble!</p>

    <p>A huge pillar of chaotic light in the sky. It landed with devastating power!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a huge earthquake occurred across the entire earth!</p>

    <p>The sea water rolled up, forming a huge tsunami. But this was a situation that had been expected. Cultivators from various countries had already worked together to set up sea-fixing barriers to prevent tsunamis from eroding the earth, blocking out the surging sea water.</p>

    <p>What also happened at the same time was tremors in the earth's crust.</p>

    <p>Almost all cultivators on earth who are still in retreat were startled by this vibration.</p>

    <p>For a moment, they opened their eyes one after another.</p>

    <p>This violent shaking feeling is unsettling.</p>

    <p>The spiritual beasts in the forest formed a beast tide. They rushed wildly in the jungle, thousands of birds sang, and the beasts roared to the sky. The whole earth seemed to be boiling at such a special and great moment!</p>

    <p>Chaos Impact is so terrifying.</p>

    <p>But all of the above are under consideration.</p>

    <p>Chaos impact is bound to cause some natural effects.</p>

    <p>But with the magic of modern cultivators, it is preventable and controllable when powerful people are stationed in various places.</p>

    <p>Of course. If the monk hadn't made preparations earlier, he would have used the device he developed to guide the energy.</p>

    <p>This impact will split the earth in half like a watermelon in an instant!</p>

    <p>The terrifying huge impact lasted for 3 minutes.</p>

    <p>Then. everything calms down!</p>

    <p>These three minutes made all cultivators on the earth feel panic and uneasiness.</p>

    <p>Planet upgrade!</p>

    <p>This is a famous scene that no cultivator on earth has ever seen!</p>

    <p>Now, with the collaborative support of the Head of State, Huaxiu Alliance and the Office of Strategic Deception! The earth has withstood the pressure of the huge chaotic catastrophe caused by this upgrade!</p>

    <p>Everyone is witnessing history! "Is it completed?" Lord Diulei asked excitedly.</p>

    <p>"It's done!" The monk opened his eyes and gave a thumbs up!</p>

    <p>The earth has survived the chaos impact unscathed. This means that the earth has completed its upgrade!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the purple thunderclouds in the sky dispersed.</p>

    <p>What immediately burst out was endless spiritual energy from heaven and earth!</p>

    <p>Just for a moment, the entire earth was covered by a strong layer of spiritual light. It was shrouded in a thick immortal fog!</p>

    <p>The cultivators on Earth began to cheer.</p>

    <p>They stepped on their spiritual swords and flew freely in the air. They breathed out the rich immortal mist after the disaster, so that their internal organs were nourished in an instant.</p>

    <p>This is a carnival for cultivators all over the world.</p>

    <p>All cultivators are celebrating in their own way.</p>

    <p>Near the Desert of Bones.</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception, patrol officer of Huaxiu Alliance, disciples applauded thunderously. Cheered!</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Heads of State of various countries who were closely watching the upgrade plan from a distance also burst into applause and sent congratulatory messages to the Huaxiu Alliance Head of State office.</p>

    <p>"It really worked!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin excitedly rushed over and hugged Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Brother Yin...you've gained weight again!" Lord Diulei couldn't laugh or cry. He let Xiao Yin wrap around him like a koala.</p>

    <p>Everyone is very excited!</p>

    <p>There is nothing more exciting than witnessing the success of Tribulation Transcendence!</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Monk Jin Deng's chaotic egg finally reacted at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Hey! Monk! Your egg finally moved!" Miss Ajuan didn't care about the upgrade of the earth at all. She had been looking forward to what kind of mythical beast would come out of the eggshell.</p>

    <p>This guy who has not been born in 300 lifetimes. I think he must be very handsome! Sparkling! Domineering! A shocking creature!</p>

    <p>Bleak!</p>

    <p>The crystal egg body had a small crack.</p>

    <p>Although I didn't see clearly what the guy in the egg looked like, a powerful aura of chaos had already surged out!</p>

    <p>"Congratulations, master! This must be a rare beast!" Lord Diulei quickly congratulated him.</p>

    <p>"Thank you True Venerated Immortal for your kind words. Let's hope this guy comes out on his own." The monk smiled.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the prairie dog, which had been lurking under the desert for a long time, finally had its chance!</p>

    <p>"The opportunity has come!!!"</p>

    <p>He roared excitedly and jumped out of the desert as fast as he could.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Er Ha also feels that his opportunity has come!</p>

    <p>It gave up the chase before and just planned to stay by the Chaos Egg, waiting for this prairie dog to fall into the trap!</p>

    <p>But you only have one chance like this...</p>

    <p>If you don't succeed, it will be very embarrassing!</p>

    <p>At this time, it already felt that the remnant soul of the groundhog exuding a strong fragrance was getting closer and closer.</p>

    <p>The other party is rapidly approaching the surface at extreme speed.</p>

    <p>"The opportunity has come!"</p>

    <p>At the moment when the marmot's remnant soul jumped out of the desert ground, Er Ha concentrated all his energy and stretched out his long tongue!</p>

    <p>"Poor guy! Although you have just been born, I have taken over your body!" The prairie dog that jumped out of the desert laughed crazily and suddenly bumped towards the Chaos Egg...</p>

    <p>The whole process. The monk seemed to have expected it.</p>

    <p>He didn't move. He didn't do anything to stop the woodchuck.</p>

    <p>"Oops!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha's tongue did not hit the woodchuck directly.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Er Ha still felt as if something was stuck to his tongue.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shocked!</p>

    <p>Immediately realized what was happening!</p>

    <p>This prairie dog succeeded in seizing the house!</p>

    <p>And he pushed out the soul of the mythical beast inside the eggshell...</p>

    <p>What is now wrapped around its tongue is the soul of the mythical beast that the monk truly gave birth to!</p>

    <p>"I, Hu Hansan, am back!" At this time, the prairie dog who had successfully snatched the body from the eggshell was very excited about getting a new body.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his claws and burst out of the shell.</p>

    <p>Etc!</p>

    <p>There seems to be something wrong with the situation...</p>

    <p>This claw. Why is it so familiar!</p>

    <p>It seems to be no different from his own claws. It's just a little smaller in size!</p>

    <p>But soon. Mr. Gray Mist realized what happened!</p>

    <p>He tried his best to snatch the mythical beast egg inside the eggshell, trying to get rid of his marmot body.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Gray Mist never expected it.</p>

    <p>Inside this eggshell is another prairie dog...</p>

    <p>"Why is it still a groundhog! Ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, the groundhog held his head and roared in panic.</p>
