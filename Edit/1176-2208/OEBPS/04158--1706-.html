  <h1>Chapter 1706 Dragonborn</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At that moment, the huge power of the diamond glove made people look at him!</p>

    <p>The man's first snap!</p>

    <p>A loud noise instantly erupted from the meteorite that was about to fall in the sky. It was blown apart on the spot.</p>

    <p>However, the lethality of the diamond gloves was far more than that. The man snapped his fingers a second time. The power was increasing step by step compared to before!</p>

    <p>After the second snap of fingers, the interior of the meteorite instantly disintegrated. It seemed as if it was annihilated by powerful energy. At the moment it was about to fall, its size gradually decreased and turned into fly ash...</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui didn't react for a moment.</p>

    <p>Super Chaos Object: Immortal Diamond Gloves...</p>

    <p>Sequence level three: Annihilation!</p>

    <p>They didn't expect to see a chaos device here with a concentration exceeding 60% and classified in the "Super God" sequence.</p>

    <p>When the concentration of chaos devices exceeds 60%, Cosmic Chaos will automatically assign sequences to such chaos devices. It is equivalent to adding the previous layer of laws!</p>

    <p>Take Master Wu Xin's previous chaos rudder as an example. Its sequence level has reached level one: Extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Take Wang Ling's Great Universe Chaos Millstone as an example. The sequence level is Level 3: Annihilation.</p>

    <p>Only those chaos devices with a chaos concentration exceeding 60% will be assigned to such a sequence.</p>

    <p>Sequence Level 1: Extraordinary</p>

    <p>Sequence Level 2: Super God</p>

    <p>Sequence Level 3: Annihilation</p>

    <p>Sequence Level 4: Light</p>

    <p>Sequence Level 5: Creation</p>

    <p>After being assigned to a sequence, it has little to do with its own specific chaos concentration. The existence of the sequence level itself is a symbol of the development potential of the chaos device! It is also a symbol of the blessing of a special ability!</p>

    <p>Rumor has it. A chaos device that has reached the "annihilation" level. The concentration of chaos may exceed the 100% saturation level in the future! Towards a higher and terrifying concentration!</p>

    <p>You can lock on the things you want to annihilate and actively track them. And open up the chaos mouth from inside to achieve complete annihilation from the inside out!</p>

    <p>"The chaos device of the annihilation sequence..." Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were both stunned.</p>

    <p>Although the chaos concentration of this diamond glove is not as good as Wang Ling's large cosmic millstone. But from their intuitive feelings, they can clearly perceive that this is a chaos device of "annihilation quality." The sequence level has reached level three. !</p>

    <p>"This person is not a mortal. He can withstand the backlash of such a chaos weapon and remain calm." Li Xian was shocked in his heart. This is what makes him most afraid.</p>

    <p>This man in a khaki trench coat wore gloves with an expressionless face and snapped his fingers. His attitude as if he didn't take anything seriously was terrifying.</p>

    <p>After handling Li Xian's meteorite, he focused his attention on Li Xian and Zhang Zhui in the next second and stretched out his hand.</p>

    <p>The diamond glove on the right hand. When the thumb and middle finger merged, there was a slight friction. The crisp sound of snapping fingers followed again.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>But this time, his target was Li Xian.</p>

    <p>Powerful chaotic fluctuations were directed at Li Xian's body. He felt like a hole appeared in his body. Infinite power of chaos was bred from it. Then there was a bang!</p>

    <p>His chest exploded immediately. Along with bright red blood, countless organs flew out from the gap. Then they were gradually devoured by the power of chaos...</p>

    <p>If this kind of damage only affects the body, the physical bodies of Li Xian and Zhang Zhui are real illusions transformed by King's Eyes. No matter how broken they are, there is no pain at all. However, the power of annihilation brought by this snap of fingers also affects the souls.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Li Xian spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>"Hurry up. Brother Zi Xiang... take Miss Zhai and leave here..."</p>

    <p>"If you want to leave, come together!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui also didn't expect that this man in khaki trench coat would be so brave. He almost killed Li Xian with a snap of his fingers.</p>

    <p>With Li Xian's soul severely damaged, he probably couldn't bear the second blow and snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>At this moment, another meteorite flew from behind the two of them!</p>

    <p>This is a soft meteorite. It is like a sponge. It does not have any lethality. It was summoned by Li Xian with all his last strength. It came directly from behind at a high speed and swept all three of them away.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui grasped the reality and immediately opened a space tunnel.</p>

    <p>In just an instant, the three of them were taken away by the soft meteorite and disappeared without a trace.</p>

    <p>"They. Can't run away..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the man wearing a khaki trench coat took off his diamond gloves and put them back into his trench coat. His short hair was flowing, and yellow lightning sizzled. Then, it evolved on the left and right sides of his forehead. There were two golden dragon horns.</p>

    <p>"Jingze, please wait. They are just at the end of their battle. There is no need to pursue them any more." Wu Xin called his name and stopped him.</p>

    <p>SCBX-L001: Jingze</p>

    <p>Dragonborn Age: 1 year old</p>

    <p>Dragon Power: Lightning Dragon</p>

    <p>Dragon Breath Attribute: Electricity</p>

    <p>Current actual combat power conversion realm: Mid-term Earthly Ancestor</p>

    <p>Dragon Power synchronization data: stable...</p>

    <p>Dragon Breath Purity Data: Stable...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>He checked the man's physical condition. After finding that it was stable as before, he breathed a sigh of relief. At the same time, he sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>When he saw for the first time what Bai Zhe and Fenmu Shen were planning behind the scenes, he felt that these two people were people he could rely on and join forces with.</p>

    <p>To resurrect the disappeared dragon clan in this form and turn them into humanoid dragon descendants who have mastered the power of dragons and can completely obey their orders. This thing seems incredible to Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>But Bai Zhe and the Fenmu Shen did it with their own strength.</p>

    <p>In this dragon cemetery floating in the air, more complete dragon bones will be excavated in the future. The remaining dragon breath from these dragon bones will be used to extract genes and cultivate more men of the same level as the man named "Jingze" in front of me. The Dragonborn!</p>

    <p>That dead fish-eyed boy on earth is too strong...</p>

    <p>Choosing to revive the dragon clan from the past to fight against him is indeed the best choice at the moment.</p>

    <p>Currently, there are eight Dragonborn being synthesized by Baobai Group. Four of them have been successfully synthesized.</p>

    <p>There are two players available for combat.</p>

    <p>And Jingze is the one who has been synthesized for the longest time. He is also the most stable person.</p>

    <p>One year of dragon birth is equivalent to 1000 years of age for a human cultivator.</p>

    <p>There are many places to cultivate dragonborn. After the synthetic incubation is completed, the cultivation is mainly accelerated through the time difference between inside and outside in a specially customized space.</p>

    <p>"Jingze, you have to remember that you are the first dragonborn in this universe. As Number 001, you are responsible for leading the dragonborn behind you to realize the revival of the dragon clan. Do you understand?" Wu Xin said through Wang Ming's body.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Jingze nodded.</p>

    <p>"Very good. Next, it's time to introduce you to SCBX-L002."</p>

    <p>Wu Xin said.</p>

    <p>He had just received an order from Bai Zhe and planned to find a partner for Jingze.</p>

    <p>"SCBX-L002?" Jingze tilted his head: "I think... I don't want a partner."</p>

    <p>"Ha. When you see it, you won't say that."</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin smiled and said: "This is a girl. She has obtained the power of the dragon, the combination of electricity and fire. The lethality will be doubled. If you work together well, no one in this world can defeat you..."</p>

    <p>"Then below, I will give you a task to cultivate tacit understanding. Go kill someone."</p>

    <p>"Sir, please tell me who you want to kill." Jingze asked obediently.</p>

    <p>"A monk."</p>

    <p>Wu Xin raised his lips and responded: "His dharma name. Jin Deng."</p>
