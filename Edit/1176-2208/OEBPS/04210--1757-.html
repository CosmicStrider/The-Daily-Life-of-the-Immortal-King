  <h1>Chapter 1757 Becoming Jiang Yingying's Master</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Jiang Yingying saw Sun Rong's swordsmanship, at that moment, she felt a string in her heart was touched.</p>

    <p>People of Jiang Yingying's generation were often influenced by many classic film and television dramas when they were young. For example, "Immortal Sword Rider" and the like... When the protagonist in the TV series walked with a sword and wielded a sword to the end of the world, what he saw. Almost everyone has a dream of being a hero.</p>

    <p>Even girls will have the dream of becoming a heroine, not just a simple magical girl.</p>

    <p>However, reality is always crueler than fantasy. Jiang Yingying has neither become a heroine who travels the world with a sword, nor has she become a magical girl.</p>

    <p>Instead, she bit the bullet and was trained by Martial Saint Jiang as the successor of Martial Saint.</p>

    <p>Wing Chun, Tai Chi, Song Huo and Lightning Whip... She actually had a hard time learning them. Regarding these martial arts knowledge, Jiang Yingying felt that she had no talent in this area.</p>

    <p>After studying for so many years, I feel like I have only scratched the surface.</p>

    <p>Being the heir of Martial Saint is definitely not enough.</p>

    <p>At most when the day is old, open a health care institutions, hanging a certain Formal Boxing master's named Chia lame Qian, cut those attempts to prolong the life of the middle-aged and elderly practitioners of leeks.</p>

    <p>But then it would definitely be a very embarrassing thing. The most important thing is that it would affect the reputation accumulated by Martial Saint Jiang.</p>

    <p>Even though she is not her biological granddaughter, Jiang Yingying's feelings for Martial Saint are real.</p>

    <p>She didn't want to wait many years before her grandfather's reputation was ruined by her own hands.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she didn't want to lie down on the sofa when she was over fifty, saying that nothing can be achieved in middle age. I am sorry to be born as a human being.</p>

    <p>So, when Jiang Yingying saw Sun Rong pretending to be "Wang Piaoliang" performing sword skills, her eyes shone at that moment.</p>

    <p>She grabbed Sun Rong's hand and told her in desire: "Pretty sister, I really don't want to be a useless person in the future... Aren't we all pursuing being independent women now?"</p>

    <p>"Stop talking... I promise..."</p>

    <p>Lian Sun Rong didn't expect that she would follow Jiang Yingying's words and directly agree.</p>

    <p>Girls resonate with each other. Sometimes it's such a simple thing.</p>

    <p>Just get to the point.</p>

    <p>Even if there are differences between them, they can instantly become good sisters and best friends.</p>

    <p>You don't even need to hold hands to go to the toilet or go shopping together to cultivate feelings...</p>

    <p>"So... what type of sword do you like to use?"</p>

    <p>She can't teach Jiang Yingying anything like swordsmanship. After all, she is so strong mainly because of the blessing of Aohai and Aohai's own passive abilities.</p>

    <p>So if you want to be unparalleled in swordsmanship, the most important thing is that the sword in your hand must be strong enough...</p>

    <p>"Sword? An ordinary one will do... I'm just here to learn swordsmanship..."</p>

    <p>"That won't work. ...... You know, there are many types of swordsmanship, and you have to determine your own path first. For example, if you are good at using a light sword, you can't use a light sword to perform a heavy sword."</p>

    <p>"Oh I see."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying nodded: "Then. Big sword?"</p>

    <p>"Big sword?"</p>

    <p>This choice made Sun Rong a little surprised. She actually didn't expect Jiang Yingying to take the two-handed sword route.</p>

    <p>"What's the problem, pretty lady?"</p>

    <p>"No. No problem. Big sword. I can teach you too." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>After all, Aohai can simulate the sword energy of all things. Just switch Aohai to the big sword mode. Let Aohai simulate the sword technique first. She learns it first. The same goes for teaching it to Jiang Yingying after she has learned it.</p>

    <p>So what Sun Rong is thinking about right now is not at all about how to teach the great sword.</p>

    <p>But I am thinking about how to choose a good one for Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>There are so many spiritual swords in the Sword King Realm. There must be a suitable one.</p>

    <p>"When the time comes, I will give you a big sword handle. The sooner you cultivate the relationship with the spirit sword, the better." Sun Rong smiled under the nine-tailed fox mask.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Master!" Jiang Yingying bowed happily after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"Ah. We have talked so much. It's time to go out. Martial Saint has already come to find you. Don't let him worry."</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying nodded.</p>

    <p>Then she took the hand from Sun Rong and stood up. She patted the dust on her body.</p>

    <p>"What to do with these people?" Then she turned her head and looked at the Yin Hu people buried in the ground.</p>

    <p>"This is a layered space. I will find a way to transfer them out. But before transferring them out. Yingying, do you want revenge?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Yin Hu and asked: "I remember. Did you say that this person beat you?"</p>

    <p>"I would like to fight back. But will it be very painful?" Jiang Yingying asked tremblingly.</p>

    <p>Although Yin Hu was instantly killed by Sun Rong, he was still several levels higher than Jiang Yingying. If Jiang Yingying just slapped him like that, I'm afraid the only one who would get hurt would be Jiang Yingying herself.</p>

    <p>"That's okay. I'll just put a film on your palm."</p>

    <p>"Film?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, it is attached to my sword energy."</p>

    <p>"so it is!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying smiled. She immediately rolled up her sleeves, looking like she was ready for a big fight.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later. In the layered space.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu and others made horrifying pig noises...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that he seemed to have a physique that made it easy to encounter ten generals. Of course, he didn't know whether it was a problem with his physique or whether the world was really too small.</p>

    <p>But now he had no choice but to meet Martial Saint Jiang. He could only follow Martial Saint Jiang and act according to circumstances.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it would be good to follow him and keep an eye on him. After all, what he was most worried about was that Wang Muyu would let Martial Saint Jiang see him, and then he couldn't explain clearly.</p>

    <p>Now that Martial Saint has him behind him, he can secretly guide him from behind...</p>

    <p>As for the situation with Sun Rong and Jiang Yingying, according to the first information he got from peeking on the screen, Jiang Yingying has been successfully rescued.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling still did not relax his vigilance.</p>

    <p>He followed Martial Saint Jiang all the way to the Roaring Heavenly Alliance where the Heavenly Dogs were.</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone?"</p>

    <p>In front of the information counter. Martial Saint Jiang sounded a changed voice.</p>

    <p>Soon, the Tengu appeared behind the curtain of the counter.</p>

    <p>His face was obviously very ugly. He had just received the news that Yin Hu and others were killed by the group in the layered space.</p>

    <p>This situation was something Tengu didn't expect.</p>

    <p>And based on the latest decision made at the meeting just now.</p>

    <p>The other Tengu have decided to give up the Yin Hu and cut off all ties with it.</p>

    <p>But he still tried to stay calm and do business with the person in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Sir, what kind of information do you want to buy?" Tengu said solemnly.</p>

    <p>"I want to find someone." Martial Saint Jiang said.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, sir. Who is he?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know. Does the boss know that there is an information dealer named Yin Hu?"</p>

    <p>"Oh. Yin Hu. I know them."</p>

    <p>Tengu nodded: "But this person has nothing to do with our Roaring Heavenly Alliance. If this gentleman can pay us a certain amount of information fees, we can send the ashes of Yin Hu to you, sir."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This was just finished by Sun Rong. The Tengu actually made the decision to abandon their partners...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered.</p>

    <p>This Yin Hu may not be a human, but these Tengu... are real dogs...</p>
