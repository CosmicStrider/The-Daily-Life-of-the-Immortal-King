  <h1>Chapter 1259 Guess! How many slaps did Wang Ling get?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment the slap touched Xu Bai's cheek. The warm and familiar touch in Wang Ling's palm was instantly transmitted through the tens of thousands of pores on Xu Bai's face.</p>

    <p>Has Devouring the Void failed?</p>

    <p>The moment he felt the pain, Xu Bai asked a question in his heart.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is not the result of the failure of Xubai Devouring.</p>

    <p>Judging from Wang Ling's current understanding of void creatures, the body surface devouring effect of void creatures does have the effect of blocking all physical attacks and even spell attacks.</p>

    <p>But in vain he missed one thing.</p>

    <p>That is Wang Ling without using spell attacks.</p>

    <p>All his normal attacks, including slaps, are all true damage!</p>

    <p>So it's not that void swallowing fails.</p>

    <p>But from the beginning, Xu Bai was too confident in his void creature abilities.</p>

    <p>However, compared to the previous battles. Wang Ling has to commend President Bai for his behavior that is much more stable than before.</p>

    <p>His slap failed to kill the opponent. It was also because President Bai left himself a backup plan.</p>

    <p>This is another ability that Wang Ling has not seen in other void creatures.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai calls it {Void Redemption}.</p>

    <p>The energy behind the Void Gate is inexhaustible. And this trick is to mobilize the power of the Void from behind the door. It is a way to reshape the damaged parts of yourself when you receive a fatal blow.</p>

    <p>Before coming here, although Xu Bai had great confidence in his winning rate in this battle.</p>

    <p>But he still left a backup plan for himself. He used the power of the void to customize many human organs in advance so that he could transfer them to himself at any time.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, because he was very confident about this battle, Xubai was just prepared and didn't have much reserves.</p>

    <p>He calculated that if Wang Ling fought with him, he might get slapped in the face, so he prepared five heads for replacement.</p>

    <p>Now. There are four left...</p>

    <p>However, judging from the way the young man in front of him used his next blow, it seemed that the opponent had lost interest in his face and was preparing to hit him elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Although the reserves in other parts are not lacking, they are not as prepared as the "head."</p>

    <p>This is the first time...</p>

    <p>Is he going to fail again?</p>

    <p>Xu Bai felt the obvious power gap in front of him. He felt sad in his heart.</p>

    <p>He has obviously given up the human body and evolved into a higher-level creature!</p>

    <p>Why!</p>

    <p>Why can't he beat this boy?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Xu Bai gripped the cane tightly. His palms were already sweating.</p>

    <p>At this time he had no other choice.</p>

    <p>I can only pray to the Lord of the Void for help!</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Xu Bai's body began to change. He tried to transform his body into the form of a virtual spirit. In this way, he could freely manipulate his body to instantly reach wherever he wanted to go.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling's slap can hit him, then whether we can catch him or not is still a question.</p>

    <p>However, what shocked Xu Bai was...</p>

    <p>His body was about to change when his whole body was shaken by a terrifying force!</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ling's eyes again!</p>

    <p>Those eyes that seem to be able to see through everything, run through the eternal night, and see through the endless universe...</p>

    <p>Terrible power. It has the power to remove the false and preserve the true!</p>

    <p>Xu Bai's entire body was frozen on the spot!</p>

    <p>Any form does not exist in front of King's Eyes!</p>

    <p>But in fact, everything that is happening now is all self-inflicted.</p>

    <p>He has become a virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>But in order to blend into the human world, he invaded other people's bodies.</p>

    <p>Maybe he was planning his own big plan.</p>

    <p>But as virtual spirits, they have become disembodied advanced beings. Invading human bodies again and merging with them is an act of self-degradation.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai originally thought that he could freely switch between the human body and the virtual body.</p>

    <p>But he missed the calculation again.</p>

    <p>The power of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>"Damn...it shouldn't be like this...it shouldn't be like this!"</p>

    <p>Xu Bai's heart began to collapse.</p>

    <p>Every time this young man dealt with him, he would come up with some new tricks that he didn't even know about!</p>

    <p>Every time he obtains information, it is not the most comprehensive!</p>

    <p>It seems like I'm forever one step behind the boy in front of me...</p>

    <p>King's Eyes is not in "Dao."</p>

    <p>This secret. Wang Ling only learned about it not long ago.</p>

    <p>So even if Xu Bai realizes the power of King's Eyes, it is impossible to deal with King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>His eyes are probably the hardest thing in the universe.</p>

    <p>No force can break it.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling is not worried at all about exposing King's Eyes in front of Xubai.</p>

    <p>Besides...</p>

    <p>Is there a next time?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't believe that after this battle, Xu Bai can survive in another identity.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Xu Bai, whose form changes were restricted by the King's Eyes, felt his soul being deeply stung.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling had no intention of giving Xu Bai any chance to think.</p>

    <p>His second palm was aimed at Xu Bai's crotch, directly smashing Xu Bai's lower body to pieces. This is also an extremely fatal part.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling! Don't underestimate me! The battle is not over yet!" At this time, Xu Bai suddenly roared.</p>

    <p>There was reluctance and anger in this roar, but Wang Ling felt that it contained more of the despair that comes from breaking a jar.</p>

    <p>Because there are not many organ reserves in other body parts.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai reacted quickly to Wang Ling's second palm. He quickly turned his face away before Wang Ling's palm fell.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was amazed by Xu Bai's operation.</p>

    <p>He even took the initiative to stretch his face over to shield other parts of his body from the knife...</p>

    <p>So after the second palm came down.</p>

    <p>The reserve of Xubai's head. I know there are only three left...</p>

    <p>After regaining his head, Wang Ling found that Xu Bai was actually smiling at himself.</p>

    <p>He had obviously eliminated him twice. But the other party actually showed a smile like a winner.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that I, Xu Bai, could withstand your second blow..."</p>

    <p>Xu Bai opened his mouth. There was a deep sense of ridicule in it.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, this person may have gone crazy.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, I stood in front of him confidently with the belief that I would win. I threatened to kill him.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Xu Bai completely changed his previous attitude. He actually took it as an honor to block how many slaps he blocked...</p>

    <p>"What a nervous and difficult opponent."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made a mental evaluation of Xu Bai.</p>

    <p>After sighing, he gave Xu Bai a third palm.</p>

    <p>The focus of this palm was very tricky. Wang Ling felt that the battle should be over.</p>

    <p>However, just when his palm was about to touch Xu Bai, Xu Bai's face accurately appeared under Wang Ling's palm again...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I told you not to underestimate me! I have already bet that you will start from this angle!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I have the last two heads left! Although I can't beat you! But I can at least withstand your fourth palm!" At this time, Xu White Hair laughed like crazy: "In this world, who else can? Can I block your four slaps? Who else!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a moment, Wang Ling was unable to refute.</p>

    <p>He felt that something was wrong with this man's brain...</p>
