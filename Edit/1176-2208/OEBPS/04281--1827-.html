  <h1>Chapter 1827: People of the Saint Tribe. Souls of the Saint Tribe. All Saint Tribes are superior to others.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No matter what, Wang Ling never expected that the Holy Clan was actually a hybrid product of ancient cultivators, God Clan, Dragon Clan and Old Dominator...</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing about this is not that this bloodline has the bloodline of dragons and Old Dominator. It is that the saints also have the bloodline of ancient cultivators.</p>

    <p>In other words, the essence of the saint race is actually still human...</p>

    <p>This is what makes Wang Ling the most horrified.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling's deduction. According to the timeline, Old Dominator is the first hybrid obtained by the Saints. Then it is the turn of the Dragons and Gods.</p>

    <p>So the big brother back then had to be very hungry to choose to marry those alien monsters with tentacles all over his body... The most outrageous thing is that he actually gave birth to a mixed-race child.</p>

    <p>Then the first mixed-race child became the first patriarch of the Holy Clan. He inherited his father's fine traditions and fell in love with a dragon. After already being mixed-blood, he mixed-blooded again and gave birth to a child who was both. A hybrid of an ancient human cultivator, an Old Dominator and a dragon.</p>

    <p>After waiting until the later gods entered the game, the current complete body of the saints was formed...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is also estimated that during this period, the Holy Race also combined with many other races. However, because the bloodline abilities of those races were too weak, they were simply not useful.</p>

    <p>So the current Saint people are really weird. In Wang Ling's view, this kind of mixed-blood behavior is tantamount to using their own blood to cultivate poison...</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that there should be a racial segregation mechanism in the universe. Even if sometimes the mechanism fails and results in mixed-race, the mixed-race children will most likely become weak and deformed due to racial mismatch. It is impossible to survive.</p>

    <p>And obviously, the original patriarch of the Holy Clan had withstood all the above tests. He truly survived with the blood of two different races.</p>

    <p>And his birth also laid a solid foundation for the Holy Race to absorb other subsequent races in the universe.</p>

    <p>"Saint people. Saint souls. Saints are all superior to others! Come on, Gui Laoliu. Kill him directly!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice from the distance encouraged again.</p>

    <p>The Holy Lord named Gui Laoliu immediately erupted. Thousands of golden tentacles emerged from the ground and turned into thousands of hands behind his feet.</p>

    <p>If you take a closer look, it turns out to be a strange ancient god. A golden ancient god with only half a body. Surrounded by arms derived from ten thousand tentacles. There is a halo of gods on the top of the head, and dragon war wings on the back. Even if such a statue is Wang Ling has never been seen before. It immediately caused the void to collapse inch by inch.</p>

    <p>At this time, fighting within the inherent spiritual realm may no longer be able to withstand such an offensive.</p>

    <p>"Heavens."</p>

    <p>The critical moment. Wang Ling operates King's Eyes. When the golden eye power is released.</p>

    <p>An eternal light seems to have lasted from eternity to the present. It has a taste of eternity.</p>

    <p>After dealing with ten sheltered creatures last time, Wang Ling once again used King's Eyes to sacrifice the "world of the heavens" that is higher than the supreme world - the King's Eyes world of the heavens!</p>

    <p>That kind of wave of annihilation of all things came from the news. It made people completely stunned. It was so shocking that they were speechless.</p>

    <p>This kind of close-up visual impact is too explosive. It cannot be matched by any special effects movie in the modern cultivation world.</p>

    <p>The golden Heavenly City is as high as the sky. The towering ancient buildings are full of brilliance. They exude unparalleled divinity and cover the entire sky.</p>

    <p>Just looking at it with the naked eye and feeling it with your body gives you a sense of awe. It makes people fall to their knees and almost want to worship.</p>

    <p>"Heavenly City..."</p>

    <p>Even Wang Muyu was stunned.</p>

    <p>This was the first time he saw Wang Ling use such a method. A look of astonishment appeared on his face. Only the strong can understand how outrageous this is.</p>

    <p>As for Chen Chao, Guo Hao and others, because their realms are too different and they have the blessing of the "Immortal King's Shield", they are not afraid of pressure and prevent many intuitive effects. Although they know that this is a great method, but for a while they can't even understand the meaning of this Heavenly City.</p>

    <p>They can only use the word "fuck" to sum up the shock in their heart and mind.</p>

    <p>"Such a thing could happen..." Even Gui Laoliu couldn't believe it. There would actually be earthly cultivators opening this door above the highest world in a human form.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that he could directly disintegrate the inherent spiritual realm of Wang Ling after sacrificing the spirit of the Dharma. However, he did not expect that the earthly boy directly used his pupil power to dissolve it and summoned such a world of heavens, completely covering the inherent spiritual realm.</p>

    <p>Compared with the inherent spiritual realm just now, the intensity of this heavenly world is self-evident... Although his hybrid ancient god cannot break through, it at the same time gives him a full sense of excitement.</p>

    <p>Because that would mean. He could cause a scene here!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>With the half-blood ancient god as its source, the vast power of chaos was condensed under the control of Gui Laoliu. The body of this half-blood ancient god suddenly swelled up, standing out in this golden city of the heavens, like a chimpanzee climbing up the roof and tearing off the tiles, and turned into the size of a city.</p>

    <p>Hiss...</p>

    <p>The people watching at the scene couldn't help but gasp. Such great magical powers were definitely not something they could reach at their level. If Wang Ling hadn't intentionally kept them to watch, perhaps even after hundreds or thousands of years of burial, they might not be able to reach this level.</p>

    <p>Everything is like a dream.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also stunned. First, she was shocked by such a fierce battle scene. Second, she was attracted by the figure of the young man towering in the sky at this time.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling can touch her heart all the time. Her thoughts can't help but flow...</p>

    <p>The enemy this time is really strong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong can indeed feel it.</p>

    <p>But she doesn't know why as long as Wang Ling is around, she can always feel a sense of peace of mind.</p>

    <p>"This ancient god is too big. It must be as big as a city! Movies don't dare to do special effects like that! How are we going to fight this? Is Wang Ling okay with him?" Guo Hao was frightened by the sight.</p>

    <p>"There must be no problem. Everyone, be careful. Just don't rush too far forward to take a look." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Your mistake was to bring these humble ants here to watch."</p>

    <p>At this time, Gui Laoliu, who had expanded the hybrid ancient god to the size of a city, smiled at Wang Ling and said, "In order to prevent you from being distracted, I decided to wipe out these ants first!"</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>He made a direct move, and as the white sleeves on his body unfolded, the strange hybrid Ancient God behind his back moved swiftly at the same time, and a fist fell from the heavens like a comet hitting the earth, aiming to whack in the direction of the multitude in the Sixty High and Uzumaki Emperor schools.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calculated the trajectory accurately and arrived in advance at the moment when the fist fell. Immortal energy lingered outside his body. He stretched out his physical fist to counterattack. He collided with this hybrid ancient god.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In an instant, in the void, the comet-sized fist of the hybrid ancient god exploded on the spot under the blow of Wang Ling!</p>
