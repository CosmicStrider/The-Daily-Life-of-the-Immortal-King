  <h1>Chapter 1226 The third force</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is the game between the great powers. They are like giants coming from the coast. They trample on the peaceful beach wantonly, completely ignoring the life and death of the little shrimps under the sand.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was caught. This carefully planned plot has been officially exposed.</p>

    <p>"Whose instructions did you get?" This was beyond the expectations of the branch leader. Zhuo Yi did not resist at all. He put on the spirit binding chain very obediently.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo. I only blame you for being too nosy. We are just following orders. You have no right to know whose instructions it is." The team leader looked indifferent. He waved his hand and ordered the others to follow Zhuo YiGet out of here.</p>

    <p>"Team leader. Zhuo Yi didn't resist at all. Is this a scam?"</p>

    <p>"There can be no fraud." The team leader shook his head confidently: "The spirit binding lock can bind all spiritual energy. If the Zhuo Yi taken away is just a clone, the moment the handcuffs are put on, the clone will Automatically disintegrate."</p>

    <p>At this time, outside the Songhai City Hundred Schools General Administration Building, in a van controlled by Er Ha in human form, Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief: "As expected of the master. He had expected this scene a long time ago."</p>

    <p>The person who was kidnapped is the "real clone" customized remotely by Wang Ling for Zhuo Yi. The same as Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. Zhuo Yi's real clone is also intelligent. Completely like Zhenren No different.</p>

    <p>This high-level Heavenly Dao level clone technique. How can a mere spirit-binding lock be broken?</p>

    <p>However, although Zhuo Yi was rescued by Wang Ling, he still had lingering fears.</p>

    <p>Because Warden Liang is really dead.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi did not see it with his own eyes, the memory of the "real clone" was shared. When he saw Warden Liang's head rolling down at his feet, he felt the heartache as if he had personally experienced it.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry too much. Little Master Ling will find a solution when everything is over. But in this case, someone has to die to make the whole thing more real. We have to make the man behind the scenes believe in him We are implementing our plan step by step. Only then did we have a chance to catch him out." Er Ha drove the vehicle skillfully and quickly left the scene with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>His skills were learned from Wei Zhi when he was driving to run drugs in the game. He doesn't have a driver's license yet. But now in order to save Zhuo Yi for Zhuo Yi. Er Ha can no longer care about so much.</p>

    <p>"I understand. I completely believe in Master. It's just that this incident is too sudden. What secrets does this Keorn have? Is it worthy for the pusher to do this?" Zhuo Yi was puzzled from the passenger seat.</p>

    <p>"Maybe the answer is here." Er Ha casually threw a tip bag to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This is actually the last message Warden Liang left for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>In order to convey this message, Warden Liang launched several spiritual swords. He knew that the message he left might be intercepted, so he used the Infinity Sword he personally wore as bait and prepared another one. The spirit sword sent the information to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>After opening the kit, Zhuo Yi found a strange list.</p>

    <p>"SBP Foundation's list information? Why does Lao Liang have it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I've seen it before. But I don't know what it means."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at this list carefully. There are seven numbers in this list. They correspond to seven Tarot cards. They are: Moon, Stars, Sun, Judgment, Chariot, Destiny and Fool.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Huaxiu Alliance has already noticed the SBP Foundation's affairs. However, the internal opinions on this foundation are not unified, which led to what happened today. And this Keorn may be involved in the core of everything. "Zhuo Yi stared at the list and said. All this is just his guess. There is no evidence so far.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the message that Warden Liang left for him was too cryptic. The only thing he could read from this message was that behind the SBP Foundation there might be seven bosses who symbolized the seven tarot cards.</p>

    <p>But who are these seven people? Everything is a mystery now.</p>

    <p>"Where are we going now?"</p>

    <p>"When we get to Wei Zhi's house, we need to gather all our people first. Zhenjun is already on his way to Jinghua City. He wants to go to General Alliance to see what's going on."</p>

    <p>"Won't you be intercepted?"</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun just replied to me with a new message. He said that a mysterious person helped him change his identity. He successfully passed the security check at the shipyard."</p>

    <p>Mysterious man...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi touched his chin, muttering in his heart.</p>

    <p>"This means that behind this incident, there are two forces at war."</p>

    <p>"No. It's three shares."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "We are the third group."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After successfully arriving at the cadre apartment where Wei Zhi lived, the first thing Zhuo Yi did was to turn on the news channel. After browsing around, I found that the report of his capture had not been released yet. I also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"The news of your capture is just a pawn in a chess game for them. It will not be released until it is absolutely necessary," Wang Zhen said.</p>

    <p>Several people in the apartment had roughly understood the ins and outs of the incident when they were still on the road in Er Ha, Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Gu Shunzhi, Zhenyuan, Li Huanran, and Wei Zhi are all here.</p>

    <p>Er Ha observed carefully and found that there was no trace of Jiang Yingyue: "Where is the ancestor of Shadow Stream?"</p>

    <p>"She is autistic in the bathroom." Liu Qingyi replied: "She has been like this since the news of Keorn was reported. It feels uncomfortable to be deceived by a cross-dressing man. I can actually understand it..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Skipping the topic of Jiang Yingyue. Zhuo Yi felt that there was still a fog in his mind: "I don't understand. What is their purpose of capturing me."</p>

    <p>"You are very close to the Office of Strategic Deception. It should be to contain the Office of Strategic Deception. But they didn't expect that the real you has been saved by us."</p>

    <p>Everyone sat on the carpet, crossed their legs in a circle, and began to analyze the situation in front of them.</p>

    <p>"There are at least two forces secretly competing within the Huaxiu AllianceGeneral Alliance... But I feel that something is missing." Zhuo Yi said: "Even if Keorn is from the SBP Foundation, he is just a foreigner. "Theoretically, there is no conflict of interest involved. Huaxiu Alliance has no reason to protect him."</p>

    <p>"We'll talk about this later. Let's analyze the information left by Warden Liang first." Gu Shunzhi also felt that this matter seemed interesting. When Zhuo Yi revealed the identity information of the seven tarot cards left by Warden Liang, When it was revealed, Gu Shunzhi found the whole thing even more interesting.</p>

    <p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

    <p>"Now, we may be the only ones in the chaos on paper. The others don't know each other's identities behind the scenes. Don't you think it's a bit like playing Werewolf?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi said: "If these seven cards symbolize the seven people behind the SBP Foundation, then why do they call each other by code names? Does this mean that they also don't know each other's identities?"</p>

    <p>"What do you mean..." Everyone looked at Gu Shunzhi with confusion.</p>

    <p>"The way to break the situation now is actually very simple. We only need to find out one of these seven people and change their identity. By then, everything hidden in the deep water will surface."</p>
