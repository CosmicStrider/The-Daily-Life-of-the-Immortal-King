  <h1>Chapter 1207 Under Golden Core. Immortal fight with gods</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang folded his arms. His eyes showed an aloof look. The moment Sun Rong stood still, an invisible wave spread from Yi Zhiyang's body. Sun Rong slashed out Aohai. The sword energy. I found that the sword energy could not penetrate the defense of the "air film" around Yi Zhiyang!</p>

    <p>The opponent actually used the power of the sword's resonance on his own "qi", and then used his own qi to build a barrier. It formed a three-foot sword-will barrier centered on itself, like a "qi film!"</p>

    <p>This barrier has excellent toughness. It can withstand almost all damage from close range and flying spells!</p>

    <p>If this sword barrier cannot be broken, all attacks will be like ice hitting flames, completely melted away.</p>

    <p>The situation is not favorable for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Even if Sun Rong uses two swords, it can control two Aohai at the same time. Compared with Yangli, whose offensive momentum is extremely fierce, it is just a mantis using its arms as a chariot.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang is indeed a strong opponent. Sun Rong has not encountered a strong opponent under the Golden Core for a long time. Although the situation looks difficult, the expression on the girl's face never shows the slightest fear.</p>

    <p>Her identity is not only the captain of the Number 60 High School delegation. She is also the future heir of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Countless masters in the cultivation world are paying attention to this game.</p>

    <p>If he fails in the battle, it may affect the group's stock market to a certain extent...</p>

    <p>This is called rich man's pressure.</p>

    <p>The honor of the school and the honor of the family. The double pressure is now on the shoulders of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The next moment, she waved the two swords in her hands, slashing in a graceful arc in the void. For a moment, everyone's hearts were filled with excitement. It was also the first time for many people to discover that the girl actually had excellent martial arts skills.</p>

    <p>She waved her swords like an elegant swan and danced a noble waltz.</p>

    <p>Finally, under rapid rotation, Aohai exuded the boundless aura of the sea. A waterspout fused with sword intent moved at high speed along the direction of Yi Zhiyang!</p>

    <p>Countless gravel on the ground was sucked up by the waterspout. The scene was as shocking as a disaster coming to the world!</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang didn't hold back at all when he saw this. He used his backhand in conjunction with Yang Li and used another "Apollo Chariot." He didn't leave Sun Rong any chance at all.</p>

    <p>The golden flaming chariot faced off against the waterspout that was as powerful as the roaring waves. Everyone around and the principals were amazed when they saw it.</p>

    <p>The Golden Core war may not reach this level. It is hard to imagine that this is actually a duel between the Foundation Building phases.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid this is a fight between the immortal gods under the Golden Core..."</p>

    <p>"I would say that today's children are overnourished. People with less than Golden Core have such spiritual powers. Logically speaking, only cultivators with Golden Core or above can cast third-level spells. These two people actually used third-level spells. Spell collision. It's a bit outrageous!" A principal was surprised: "Think about the spiritual power I had when I was in the Foundation Building stage. Being able to release level 2 is already an excellent level..."</p>

    <p>"Today's children are very well-nourished. It seems that the People's Education Inspection Standards will be improved in the future."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The chariot collided with the waterspout. A big explosion occurred in the field. The onlookers were greatly unlucky. Many people were blown away by the air waves.</p>

    <p>The only fault was that they were too close. Although they wanted to save some spiritual energy, the protective barrier that should be established could not be spared at this moment. Tang Jingze, Guo Hao, and Li Youyue reacted quickly and used the protective barrier to withstand the impact.</p>

    <p>Yan Xiaochun used the innate advantage of {Titan Technique} to stay in place. Although he was not blown away by the air wave, he was only slightly injured because he was too close to the explosion range. It was lucky that the protective golden light was not triggered.</p>

    <p>The most unlucky thing is the four eyes in the sky of the South Huaxiu Sea...</p>

    <p>His reaction speed was too slow and he was too close to the explosion range. He was forced to trigger the golden protective talisman before he had time to dodge.</p>

    <p>"I knew there would be good things about being a fan of classmate Wang Ling! I won without even doing anything!" Xia Ming was very excited.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Xia Ming himself realized that the second round of offense between Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong might make a big move.</p>

    <p>Therefore, a certain distance was ensured before the two started fighting. Therefore, they were not affected by any fluctuations. So to sum up, the most aggrieved people are still the two people in Nanhai Tianzhong: Nan Yixiu and Siyan...</p>

    <p>Although Si Yan's own strength is mediocre, he can still be regarded as a fighting force. The author didn't even bother to give him a name. Now he has really become cannon fodder.</p>

    <p>Now, the pressure on Nan Yixiu is even greater...</p>

    <p>However, I am still confident about defeating Wang Ling. Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling. While everyone was reacting quickly to the explosion in front of them, Wang Ling's idea was... He wanted to take advantage of the fluctuation of the explosion to trigger the effect of the golden protective amulet. Quit this boring game as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling stood motionless on the spot. As long as the effect of the golden protective talisman could be triggered, he could leave the game early and rest and eat crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>However, although this plan was good, it could not stop Sun Rong from fighting Yi Zhiyang. He actually put some thoughts on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling was about to be affected by the fluctuations, Sun Rong made a prompt decision. He threw out a handful of cloned Aohai. He helped Wang Ling withstand the fluctuations...</p>

    <p>It's over. Sun Rong actually felt quite embarrassed: "Classmate Wang Ling! You don't need to thank me!"</p>

    <p>Protecting the members of your own camp is originally the responsibility of the captain.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In the horrified eyes of everyone, the drama between the chariot and the waterspout ended in a draw between the two. Sun Rong sacrificed the second cloned Aohai. However, the expression on her face did not change. fluctuated.</p>

    <p>The sword spirit that clones the sword is actually an artificial machine without emotions. In addition to obeying the orders of Sun Rong, there will be no unnecessary emotional components involved.</p>

    <p>The one who really has feelings for Sun Rong is the twin sword spirit who is the main body.</p>

    <p>However, the situation at hand. Sun Rong still seems to have no intention of releasing his true twin sword spirits. Unless the clone sword is completely consumed, the twin sword spirits will not easily go into battle.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang naturally saw this: "Classmate Sun Rong, your clone sword is the strongest I have ever seen. But you have to be clear. The power of the clone sword is limited after all. Your third-level spell is very strong." But without the blessing of the twin sword spirits, it is impossible to fight with me..."</p>

    <p>At this point in the battle, Yi Zhiyang felt that the girl in front of him had not realized the gap in combat power. He felt that he could already release further power.</p>

    <p>Although before that, his adoptive father and master told him that it is best not to use this trick unless it is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, something will be easily exposed.</p>

    <p>But now, in this highly anticipated game, Yi Zhiyang feels that he can no longer care about so much.</p>

    <p>He enjoyed the shocked and admiring looks of the people around him. He enjoyed the atmosphere of this most powerful showdown under the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the aura all over Yi Zhiyang's body surged again. A trace of golden-red sword energy began to boil from his body surface. Even his hair was rendered into a dazzling golden color like the sun.</p>

    <p>This man. He even mastered General Yi's {Wuji Sword}...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling's eyebrows finally twitched slightly.</p>

    <p>He finally understood why Yi Zhiyang was confident that he was invincible under the Golden Core. With the blessing of {Wuji Sword}, a unique secret method that should not have been mastered by the Foundation Building period... Yi Zhiyang could naturally call himself invincible.</p>

    <p>However, this also means that Sun Rong will be in danger.</p>

    <p>The power of Wuji Sword. Wang Ling experienced it with my own eyes when I watched General Yi play against Head of State.</p>

    <p>The power of that sword energy. I'm afraid that even with the protective golden light, Sun Rong will be seriously injured.</p>

    <p>Looking at the scene in front of him, Wang Ling sighed secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to take action.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that he needs to secretly help Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The emergence of Wuji Sword has somewhat destroyed the checks and balances.</p>

    <p>As an expert in checks and balances and a master of test averages, Wang Ling was already thinking of ways to help Sun Rong when he saw this scene.</p>
