  <h1>Chapter 1537 As we all know. Wang Ling is a realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zheng climbed out of the sinkhole with a radius of hundreds of kilometers. His claws were clasped on the edge of the sinkhole. His mood was complicated.</p>

    <p>He's so big. Even Dao Ancestor Wang hasn't beaten him!</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that I would be attacked by the monk's disciples now. And it was successful...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling strolled over and looked down at Zheng.</p>

    <p>This is Dao Ancestor Wang's dharma creature. It is indeed different from the enemies he has dealt with before.</p>

    <p>He was clearly slapped from behind. It seemed that he didn't even suffer any internal injuries. He just looked a little disgraced.</p>

    <p>If it had been anyone else, I'm afraid he would have vomited blood long ago.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>He knew that a war was inevitable.</p>

    <p>In order to save the disposable Talisman on him, he took off all the remaining sixty or so pieces and put them away temporarily.</p>

    <p>These disposable Talisman are for later games.</p>

    <p>It would be a pity if it was consumed by the battle in front of me.</p>

    <p>I saw Zheng climbing out of the sinkhole. Wang Ling wanted to step forward and step on his toes.</p>

    <p>But thinking that if I step on it, there will definitely be a piece of meat paste on the sole of my foot, I still put my foot back.</p>

    <p>He was still wearing a pair of white shoes.</p>

    <p>Washing shoes etc. is the most troublesome.</p>

    <p>Use magic to clean. The purification force is too strong. It is easy to deform the shoes after washing.</p>

    <p>So when it comes to cleaning shoes, Wang Ling is usually used to doing it himself.</p>

    <p>"Don't think because you're the monk's disciple. I won't kill you..."</p>

    <p>After climbing out of the sinkhole, Zheng quickly floated into the air. The black rune spear in his hand erupted. Chaos light was exuding all over his body, sweeping across the sky and the earth.</p>

    <p>It is rare for Wang Ling to see such a doomsday scene.</p>

    <p>Because often when Wang Ling takes action, the entire planet disappears before the end of the world arrives.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that as a Dharma creature of Dao Ancestor Wang, Zheng possesses peerless power. This power is even more terrifying than Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And how strong the Dharma image is actually reflects the combat power of its owner.</p>

    <p>Zheng has such combat power. Dao Ancestor Wang's combat power must be greater than or equal to above.</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren, who was imprisoned in King's Eyes by Wang Ling, also looked at this scene in surprise.</p>

    <p>He thought that after entering the ancestral realm, he had reached a level that surpassed that of his master, Dao Ancestor Wang... But now it seems that the gap still exists.</p>

    <p>Such a sense of disparity made him feel helpless and deeply unwilling.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be bound by King's Eyes like this.</p>

    <p>But in this current situation, he can't get out of here.</p>

    <p>Although it was not done willingly, the only person who could help him get out of trouble now seemed to be "Zheng" in front of him.</p>

    <p>The overwhelming fury further amplified Zheng's aura.</p>

    <p>The entire world is filled with waves of sand, and the sky is filled with particles of chaos. This is a material phenomenon that occurs when the energy of chaos reaches an extreme level.</p>

    <p>When these grains of sand are raised, they are like a vast ocean, sweeping across the sky.</p>

    <p>The lethality of Chaos Particles is extremely terrifying. If an ordinary person is caught in the storm of Chaos Particles, they will be torn into pieces immediately.</p>

    <p>This move. Zheng is often used to clear the field. On the other hand, it also wants to test how strong the physical body of some Wang Ling is.</p>

    <p>As a result, the boy was standing there in the storm with his hands in his pockets. He didn't even move his bangs.</p>

    <p>After an unexpected and somewhat awkward opening.</p>

    <p>The place fell into dead silence again.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng landed from the universe and was responsible for taking care of Jingke on the side.</p>

    <p>When he saw Wang Ling take the picture of Zheng, the monk already knew it. Wang Ling decided to do it himself.</p>

    <p>This battle is inevitable.</p>

    <p>He wanted to give some advice.</p>

    <p>It can be found that Zheng is stubborn.</p>

    <p>In fact, you can't blame him.</p>

    <p>Everything Zheng did was loyal to Dao Ancestor Wang's orders.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren..." The monk revealed his eyes. He knew that Wang Ling had felt what was in his heart.</p>

    <p>This is pleading for "Zheng." I hope Wang Ling can be gentler. It won't take a few slaps to kill Zheng.</p>

    <p>Although the problem of foolishness and loyalty is indeed difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>However, Zheng has silently done many things in the universe these years that others cannot do for them.</p>

    <p>There is also hard work.</p>

    <p>This is true. Wang Ling understands.</p>

    <p>To be honest, even if the monk didn't say anything, Wang Ling had no intention of killing Zheng.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to teach this arrogant Dharma creature a little lesson.</p>

    <p>Additionally. For Zheng.</p>

    <p>This opponent is different from his previous opponents. In fact, Wang Ling is not confident that a slap can really kill Zheng or seriously injure him.</p>

    <p>He looked at Zheng.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was only one thought in my mind.</p>

    <p>That is.</p>

    <p>This battle.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I need to be a little more serious.</p>

    <p>"Interesting... Interesting!" At this moment. The Rune Spear was in his hand. He spoke to the monk who was taking care of Jingke at the side: "Monk. This disciple of yours. He's really good at what he does. Of all the juniors I've fought. I would call him the strongest!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Jin Deng: "..."</p>

    <p>This misunderstanding is too deep.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng actually wanted to explain clearly, but for a moment he didn't know how to speak.</p>

    <p>Because of his first reaction when he saw Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It is the same as Zheng now.</p>

    <p>I just feel that Wang Ling is too young.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for a strong young man in his teens to be invincible in the world.</p>

    <p>So Jin Deng felt that he was really not qualified to laugh at "Zheng."</p>

    <p>Everyone has been here.</p>

    <p>This matter doesn't require much explanation.</p>

    <p>Just get a few slaps and you'll know.</p>

    <p>"What a pity. Monk."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zheng pointed the tip of the spear at Wang Ling: "Although your apprentice is excellent, he will surely perish here today!"</p>

    <p>The words just fell!</p>

    <p>A moment!</p>

    <p>War arouses!</p>

    <p>It was like a beast roaring in chaos. With a huge roar, the scene in front of you changed. Space and time were disrupted!</p>

    <p>The space in front of Wang Ling exploded on the spot.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The earth cracked open. Stretching for infinite distances. Measured in units of thousands of miles. Black cracks continued to spread in all directions. There were bottomless black abyss everywhere.</p>

    <p>Endless flames of chaos gush out from the cracks.</p>

    <p>"Earthly Ancestor level." Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he truly felt the true realm of Zheng.</p>

    <p>A strong man in the ancestral realm. Still an Earthly Ancestor.</p>

    <p>The strength is indeed extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Such a scene seems destructive and grand. But in fact it is just a basic operation of the Earthly Ancestor environment. Zheng has not taken it seriously yet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling What I'm thinking at the moment is.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the inner world has been strengthened by him.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it will collapse.</p>

    <p>The flames of chaos burned the entire world, turning Wang Ling's black hair into fiery red.</p>

    <p>His pair of King's Eyes are even more fiery red.</p>

    <p>This doomsday scene makes Wang Ling feel unhappy.</p>

    <p>The existence of Chaos Flame is actually very detrimental to Jingke.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes started running immediately.</p>

    <p>A golden vortex overflowed from Wang Ling's pupils. Then it multiplied to infinity. It was like a man-made black hole. It swallowed up all the chaotic objects in front of it...</p>

    <p>Then, the turbulent world returned to calm.</p>

    <p>"Is that the only way?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the Dharma creature with trembling pupils. There was only one sentence left.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>PS: Let's sort out the realms again: Foundation Building, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Itinerant Immortal, True Immortal, True Venerated Immortal, Venerated Immortal, Sage Immortal, Dao Immortal, Dao Supreme, Dao God, Dao Ancestor, Human Ancestor, Earthly Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor, Ancestor King, Ancestor Immortal... Wang Ling...</p>
