  <h1>Chapter 1199 The Void Thing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Pulled out the all-encompassing pillar inserted into the Sun Spirit. The pitch-black pillar instantly shrank in Wang Ling's hand to the size of a toothpick. Wang Ling used the power of King's Eyes to search repeatedly. It was found that the material corresponding to the casting of this dense pillar was not found in the ten universes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was secretly surprised. This pillar was actually the same as his "King's Eyes." It was not in "Dao."</p>

    <p>He held the shrunken pillar with two fingers and savored what the Sun Spirit had just said: Behind the Void Gate is emptiness...</p>

    <p>So what is this emptiness?</p>

    <p>There is no shortage of empty people in this world. Sometimes even Wang Ling himself will feel a complete sense of emptiness.</p>

    <p>Could it be that the person living behind the Void Gate is also a master who stands in an invincible position like him and often feels lonely and empty?</p>

    <p>However, this is just the judgment of Wang Ling. If you want to get the answer, you must open the door to the void to find out.</p>

    <p>"You are strong."</p>

    <p>At this time, the hollow voice of the sun spirit, like a kind old man, sounded from the void again.</p>

    <p>As a cosmic spirit that has survived for billions of years, the Sun Spirit has its own thoughts and insights: "I have lived for billions of years. With such a number, all the cultivators on the earth are just a drop in the ocean compared to me." .No human being can live to be billions of years old. However, if you look at the entire universe, I am just an ant-like existence... The gate to the void. Anyone who intrudes will die. This may not be a place you can set foot in."</p>

    <p>What surprised Wang Ling was that the purpose of the Sun Spirit, who never nagged, said so many words was to warn him.</p>

    <p>"What kind of magic weapon is this?" Wang Ling asked, holding the thin black needle in his hand. He had been looking at it for a long time, but he didn't see what kind of object it was.</p>

    <p>"This is a void thing derived from the Void Gate. If you can't even see it... that's enough proof. Behind the Void Gate, it's not something you can touch..." When he said these words, the sun Ling's tone was very indifferent. However, in his heart, he was secretly glad that Wang Ling was also frustrated at times.</p>

    <p>In fact, as the Spirit of the Sun, he doesn't know what is behind the Void Gate. He doesn't know whether Wang Ling will die if he steps into the Void Gate.</p>

    <p>However, in this long history, the Spirit of the Sun has witnessed too many creatures who died trying to jump through the Void Gate...</p>

    <p>This is not a legend. It exists alongside the Gate to Another World and the Gate to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>So far, of the three doors, Wang Ling is the only one that I haven't entered yet.</p>

    <p>Behind the gate to another world is the demon world.</p>

    <p>This is an artificial door designed by Zhenyuan Immortal. Because the test is unstable, it often appears on the earth without permission and brings some disasters.</p>

    <p>The gate of Heavenly Dao. It is directly connected to the Heavenly Dao Committee where the six Heavenly Dao are located. Wang Ling is a whitelist user. Every time I go there, it is like returning to my own home.</p>

    <p>So judging from this. Wang Ling thinks that maybe what is connected behind the Void Gate is also another world.</p>

    <p>It's just that this Gate of the Void looks particularly low-key. If there really are some advanced creatures there, then these creatures are indeed low-key enough in the eyes of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because it's too strong. So you disdain it?</p>

    <p>But these are just inferences from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although he is curious about the Gate of the Void, so far the Gate of the Void has not disturbed his normal study life, nor has it disturbed him from eating crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is impossible for Wang Ling to take the initiative to open the door to the void.</p>

    <p>It's not because the door can't be opened. It's because Wang Ling feels that it would be too violent to force the door open without a proper reason.</p>

    <p>As for the Senluowanxiang Pillar in my hand, which is defined as a "thing of the void" by the Sun Spirit. Wang Ling thinks it would be better to find an appropriate time to return it.</p>

    <p>After all, this is someone else's thing.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Friday, November 21st. The seventh day of the National Cultivation School Physical Martial Arts Competition. There is still one day left before the end.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Crispy Noodles changed their identities in the temporary toilet built by the Number 60 High School camp.</p>

    <p>After confirming the time, Wang Ling just realized that when he was dueling with Wang Ying in space, three days had passed on the earth... This should be caused by King's Eyes' ability to stop time." Sequelae."</p>

    <p>The time in the area is stationary. There will be a time difference with the outside.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't think too much at the time. He was just glad that he didn't stay still for too long. Otherwise, he might have graduated from high school directly. And this book would have ended directly at that time.</p>

    <p>It took seven days. It was the last moment of the decisive battle.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling came out of the toilet, he found that everyone in the rest of the school had left. Crispy noodles gathered what happened during this period into a memory chain and passed it to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The mission of Xiao Yin, Er Ha, and Wang Zhen went very smoothly.</p>

    <p>All the flowers of the living dead containing embryos in the stalactite cave were completely destroyed. They rescued Mr. Huang. The fake Mr. Huang was also captured by President Qi and Zhuo Yi in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>Among all the resurrected masters, only Li Xiaokai's masters Li Huanran and Jiang Yingyue survived...</p>

    <p>The existence of Li Huanran is beneficial to the research on the Gate of the Void.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jiang Yingyue will also be an excellent witness to this chaos. President Qi needs Jiang Yingyue as a witness to report to the Head of State.</p>

    <p>Of course, the main reason why Jiang Yingyue survived was because of... Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>The "remnant" who pretends to be Mother Wang and uses the name of the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother to deceive everyone is the next target.</p>

    <p>With active communication from Lord Diulei, the Huaxiu Alliance decided to issue a wanted order to the world after verifying the relevant details.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, on the sixth day of the competition, the camps formed by each school agreed to disintegrate after equally sharing the materials obtained during the joint alliance time. The remaining schools agreed to avoid fighting in the next day. Made a "gentleman's oath."</p>

    <p>If someone from a school violates the regulations and sneaks attacks or attacks on other schools in advance, they will be despised by all other schools.</p>

    <p>Although great soldiers are not afraid of deceit, if they break their oath to win the championship, even if they win the championship, they will be despised by thousands of people.</p>

    <p>And now. The seventh day has arrived. This day is also the deadline for a gentleman's oath.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the numbers displayed on the dome mountain.</p>

    <p>Now, all schools combined, there are less than 80 people left.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling counted the remaining people in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>No one in Number 60 High School left...</p>

    <p>Of the less than 80 people left, they account for nearly 10% of the number in Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>Looking at other schools, it seems to be more tragic.</p>

    <p>Take some of the previous favorites for example.</p>

    <p>The remaining number of people in Nanhai Tianzhong: 4 people.</p>

    <p>Number of students remaining in Titan High School: 3.</p>

    <p>The remaining number of people in Henghuo High School is 1...</p>

    <p>In comparison, Number 60 High School is as stable as an old dog!</p>
