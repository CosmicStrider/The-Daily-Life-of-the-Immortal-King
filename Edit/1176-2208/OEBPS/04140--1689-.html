  <h1>Chapter 1689 The capitalization is outrageous</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor saved his life at this critical moment.</p>

    <p>It's not the holy armor. Master Wu Xin knew that he was already dead. After all, he underestimated the power of Wang Ling's palm just now.</p>

    <p>Who could have imagined that with the power of this palm, the entire ground of his supreme world could sink dozens of feet!</p>

    <p>This terrifying and violent explosive force formed a devastating force in an instant. He was unable to resist at all and flew across the spot.</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, the Holy Armor of the Dragon Emperor, which had experienced dozens of baptisms of chaos, was in shreds. There was no possibility of repair...</p>

    <p>In the distance, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception was amazed. Although for those who are familiar with Wang Ling, such a scene is an expected result. But when you actually see it with your own eyes, you can't help but be shocked.</p>

    <p>If there is anyone whose mind is blank at this moment, it is Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This is no longer a question of whether you have a lot of question marks, children.</p>

    <p>But the little question mark is whether you have many friends...</p>

    <p>The shocked expression on Jiugong Liangzi's face could hardly be described in words. His appearance was so much like those exaggerated cartoons. If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she would not have been able to imagine how powerful Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>"Is this...is this still the classmate I know Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>She hid her slightly open mouth in surprise. Through the visual scene shared by monk Jin Deng in the core world, she witnessed with her own eyes Wang Ling shattered the Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor with one palm. Master Wu The famous scene where Xin is beaten to the point of vomiting blood.</p>

    <p>What surprised her even more was what happened next.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling seems to have no intention of holding back.</p>

    <p>His actions were no longer as hesitant as at the beginning. Instead, he took the initiative to launch a new round of offensive.</p>

    <p>Huh!</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling blow out a breath. This is the essence of the source. It is a substance derived from the condensation of the original Qi. At this moment, it is not only condensed and sprayed out of the body by Wang Ling, but also mixed with a kind of chaotic energy. There is An extremely sacred feeling.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the aura of the great avenue filled the entire place. A shocking cosmic divine voice that was understandable came from Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>"This is impossible! How could it be like this!" At this moment, Master Wu Xin felt that his three views were shattered. He could not believe that such a voice came from Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>And there are many kinds of sounds!</p>

    <p>This kind of sound, which could only be transmitted in the universe, actually came from the body of a young man...</p>

    <p>So what does this mean?</p>

    <p>This means...</p>

    <p>This boy's body may be the incarnation of the universe.</p>

    <p>Of course, this is only Master Wu Xin's own speculation. He simply could not imagine that such an outrageous thing would happen in front of him.</p>

    <p>Really. Ridiculously capitalized!</p>

    <p>Such a vision is very astonishing. Wang Ling When this mouthful of original essence mixed with the power of chaos was spit out on this supreme world, uh, the earth, a great lotus flower actually appeared out of thin air!</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao, Fate, Shadow, Heavenly Dao... all kinds of avenues turned into lotus petals to support this lotus of avenues from the ground. But it was not until this moment that everyone at the Office of Strategic Deception discovered that in addition to the above In addition to the power of several familiar avenues. Wang Ling has more avenues than these!</p>

    <p>Because this lotus of the Dao has a total of twenty-eight petals!</p>

    <p>When the Lotus of the Great Dao rose directly from the ground, Wang Ling's eyelids jumped. Because he himself did not expect that he actually had twenty-eight kinds of great ways...</p>

    <p>Could it be that the major avenue he majored in was too strong and suppressed the other avenues, so that he didn't notice it at all on weekdays?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Although his expression was calm, he was shocked inside.</p>

    <p>He clearly remembered that six years ago when he was repelling the demon world's attack, his Great Lotus only had two petals. Unexpectedly, six years later, it already had twenty-eight petals.</p>

    <p>Such brutal growth made Wang Ling feel sad in his heart.</p>

    <p>But even he didn't expect that he would sacrifice the Lotus of the Avenue again.</p>

    <p>The lotus has grown to this point. For others, this shocking effect is naturally more brilliant. When the buds of the lotus bloom, a slim crystal immortal child shows a graceful figure from the heart of the lotus. Her whole body is crystal clear. The face is invisible. The extremely graceful body curves are covered with a layer of light gauze. The beauty is unparalleled.</p>

    <p>It was clearly only three inches in size, but it was blooming with astonishing spiritual energy at this moment. The moment he opened his eyes, infinite spiritual light was released. Along with the terrifying light, it swept across all directions, illuminating the supreme world.</p>

    <p>"In my territory, don't be arrogant..." Master Wu Xin couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>He clearly knew how powerful Wang Ling was. But he couldn't just watch Wang Ling act recklessly here.</p>

    <p>It's clear that this is his world. He is the master and god here. But a stupid young man has become the master here. Doesn't he want to lose face?</p>

    <p>"Today, I will kill you even if I pay all the costs!" At this time, Wu Xin's mood changed. At first, he planned to make specimens of Wang Ling and Wang Nuan brother and sister for collection. However, But now I can't care about so much. I just want to use all means to let the two people die.</p>

    <p>This Lotus of Great Dao is certainly extraordinary, but most Daoists are not Wang Ling majoring in Dao. Therefore, I accidentally thought that its ability might not be as strong as imagined.</p>

    <p>He maximized the fluctuations in his divine brain, intending to establish a spiritual connection with the entire supreme world. Then, under the instillation and communication of the vast will of the world, a terrifying creature emerged from the ground.</p>

    <p>It was forcibly summoned by him with the power of his divine brain and the will of the world!</p>

    <p>It is also a terrifying monster that Wu Xin has been researching and creating.</p>

    <p>This burly creature has countless faces. The most obvious one is a dragon head with tentacles.</p>

    <p>The long dragon neck poked out from the bloated body. It was spraying chaotic flames! There were arms and claws on all sides. It was like a combination of various ultimate creatures. It had a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Just like the Lotus of the Great Path, this weird multi-faced creature also possesses the power of multiple great ways.</p>

    <p>"Huh? What is this?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that he even captured the Dharma Spirit of Taoist Dragon...and also captured many indescribable creatures from the Dao Sect. He fused these creatures together." Monk Jin Deng was equally horrified in his heart.</p>

    <p>But when he saw the calm look on Wang Ling's face in the blink of an eye, he felt completely relieved again.</p>

    <p>It is true. Finding creatures with different abilities of the Dao and then combining them together can indeed achieve a similar effect to the lotus of the Dao under Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>But the difference is that these avenues are not Master Wu Xin's own after all.</p>

    <p>This person still knows nothing about power.</p>

    <p>"Ya, ya, ya!" At this time, Wang Nuan, who had been lying on Wang Ling's shoulder, also jumped to give it a try. He raised his hands and commanded.</p>

    <p>This was said to the immortal child derived from the Lotus of the Avenue. It seemed to be giving some instructions.</p>

    <p>"What is Nuan Zhenren talking about?" Office of Strategic Deception. Most people don't understand.</p>

    <p>Only Er Ha understood: "Ah Nuan girl let that Dao Lian immortal son. Activate the battle mode..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
