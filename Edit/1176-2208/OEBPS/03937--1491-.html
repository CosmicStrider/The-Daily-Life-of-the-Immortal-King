  <h1>Chapter 1491 Dawei Dragon!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This thunder dragon was shot from the palm of monk Jin Deng. On the spot, the dark clouds in the sky were twisted together like twists. It only took an instant. The thunder in the sky was accompanied by the dragon's roar.</p>

    <p>By the time Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi reached the top, the top of the mountain that was originally obscured by dark clouds actually showed a dazzling scene of clouds and fog dispersing, and the sun shining brightly.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng's palm consumed all the thunderclouds accumulated in this area.</p>

    <p>However, Fenglei Mountain has a special environment. The sun shining here is considered a strange phenomenon. The bright scene in front of us is temporary. In less than half an hour, the place will be covered by a large number of dark clouds again.</p>

    <p>Ordinary people would not dare to set foot in a dangerous area covered by thunder like this. Monk Jin Deng naturally didn't care.</p>

    <p>He can even withstand the thunder of chaos, let alone this mere nature.</p>

    <p>The reason why we chose Fenglei Mountain is that the monk is actually practicing his new palm technique: {Dawei Dragon}.</p>

    <p>A palm technique that can condense the power of nature. Convert natural energy into spiritual energy to cause explosive lethality. Monk Jin Deng has tried many condensations of natural power. In the end, he found that natural thunder is the most powerful blessing to the palm technique.</p>

    <p>Of course, compared to the monk's other more destructive palm techniques, there is actually a big gap between {Dawei Dragon}. As far as Monk Jin Deng can judge, this set of palm techniques can only be regarded as his basic palm techniques. However, there is indeed a need for research.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Monk Jin Deng found that his palm skills are too powerful. Although the character of One Palm Holy Monk is very handsome, if he has to face some tasks of capturing alive, there is a small probability that he will make a mistake...</p>

    <p>He was obviously the target to be captured alive, but he ended up being transcended by his own palm. This was very embarrassing.</p>

    <p>And {Dawei Dragon} is a new spell developed by monk Jin Deng based on his current situation. In addition to regulating the power, the more important point is... this trick can 100% capture the monk alive on the earth. Any ghost.</p>

    <p>"You are Senior Jin Deng..." Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect that this time Zhuo Yi actually didn't lie to her!</p>

    <p>He successfully led her to find the legendary senior who developed {Ghost Book}...</p>

    <p>There was obviously a look of excitement on her face. She wanted to kneel down to salute, but the moment her knees bent, she was helped up by monk Jin Deng: "Girl, you don't have to be so polite."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled. His smooth head reflected light under the direct sunlight.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was stunned. Suddenly she felt that Monk Jin Deng was much kinder than she thought. And... he also looked younger than she thought.</p>

    <p>"Senior, do you know me?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course. You are a child of the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng said: "The old head of the Jiugong family was once an old friend of mine. And the {Ghost Book} given to him was actually a testimony of my friendship with him."</p>

    <p>"Then senior must also know about me?"</p>

    <p>"It's natural. Mr. Zhuo and I are also good friends. I knew you were coming to see me before he told me."</p>

    <p>A few short words shocked Jiugong Liangzi. Monk Jin Deng was an expert at knowing things. Even more amazing than she imagined.</p>

    <p>What surprised the girl the most was that such a senior who was kind to their Jiugong family actually seemed to have a close friendship with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>So now Jiugong Liangzi feels completely messed up.</p>

    <p>She felt that the Zhuo Yi she knew was not the same person as the old liar widely rumored within the Jiugong family...</p>

    <p>"The replica {Ghost Book} in Miss Liangzi's hand is the real reason for the riot. The poor monk already knows who the culprit is."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk narrowed his eyes: "Someone used the {Ghost Book} to forcefully open the replica's escape channel and release those ghosts."</p>

    <p>"Use primary residence..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>The main book of {Ghost Book} was sealed in Jiugong's home... In other words, the real reason for the riots in the replica {Ghost Book} in her hand was indeed related to the people inside Jiugong's home on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "But who is it..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the monk was silent and said calmly: "It's not time for the poor monk to reveal this matter, because it is related to the fate of Miss Liangzi and the Jiugong family. Therefore, the poor monk can only talk about it here. The rest of the matter is still needed. Miss Liangzi went to investigate on her own."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Thank you for your guidance, senior."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's pupils contracted slightly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she already had a brand new strategy in mind.</p>

    <p>Before fighting against the outside world, you must first settle the inside. It is urgent to deal with the internal affairs of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>But if she returns to investigate in person now, she will definitely encounter a more dangerous situation.</p>

    <p>So now. It seems there is only one way left.</p>

    <p>This is a plan that was previously "suspended" by Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that this plan seems to be the best choice...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>That night, Jiugong Liangzi went to meet someone.</p>

    <p>After deciding to reactivate the "on hold" plan, it took her several hours to make up her mind to come.</p>

    <p>For Jiugong Liangzi, this is the first time in her short life of more than ten years that she has come to ask for special favors like this.</p>

    <p>As Jiugong Liangzi's entrustment, in fact even Sun Rong was surprised: "Classmate Liangzi, you are..."</p>

    <p>The living room of the villa where Sun Rong lives. Various gifts brought by Jiugong Liangzi are placed on the floor.</p>

    <p>There are perfumes, high-end cosmetics, skin care products and many local specialties exclusive to Sun Island.</p>

    <p>"I know you don't lack anything. So if you want these things, take them. If you don't, just throw them away. Anyway, I'll put them here. It doesn't matter even if you throw them away." Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi took the trouble. Since it is a gift from Classmate Liangzi, of course I will cherish it." Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>After getting to know Jiugong Liangzi's personality, she was already used to some of the girls' words that sounded a bit "harsh" and "discourteous."</p>

    <p>Because these words need to be listened to in reverse.</p>

    <p>"Since you accepted my gift, does that mean...that you are willing to help me?" Jiugong Liangzi had a hopeful look on his face.</p>

    <p>"I need to hear what the business is first."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled and said: "If Liangzi comes here for breast enlargement, I definitely can't help it..."</p>

    <p>"You sound like you're very big!" Jiugong Liangzi sneered.</p>

    <p>"I'm older than you. Classmate Liangzi." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>This is her deliberate attempt to test Jiugong Liangzi's sincerity.</p>

    <p>What Sun Rong didn't expect was that the girl in front of him was not angry because of these words. It seemed that he really wanted something from her.</p>

    <p>"I came to you...that's not why I came to you!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi calmed down and looked at Sun Rong. She hesitated for a moment, then slowly said: "I want to ask classmate Sun Rong to pretend to be me and return to Jiugong's house."</p>

    <p>"Why are you asking me?" Faced with such a request, Sun Rong felt surprised.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi looked at Sun Rong and said seriously: "Because only you are worthy of pretending to be me, Jiugong Liangzi!"</p>

    <p>"Is that so?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Sun Rong smiled and said, "Isn't it really the suggestion that senior Zhuo Yi gave you?"</p>

    <p>Just half an hour ago in fact.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong received a text message from Zhuo Yi to explain Jiugong Liangzi's plan in detail.</p>

    <p>And at the beginning of the message. The first words were: " Master's Wife! I beg you.</p>

    <p>...</p>
