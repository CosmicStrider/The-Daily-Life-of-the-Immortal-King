  <h1>Chapter 1576 Senior Wang! Forever a god!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>One percent Fenmu Shen was horrified.</p>

    <p>Even if he condenses one percent of his soul clone, the power of this east wind wave cannot be blocked by normal earth cultivators.</p>

    <p>However, the male Earthling in front of me is clearly just in the body-refining stage...</p>

    <p>He actually completely defeated the "Dongfeng Wave" with just his own arms.</p>

    <p>One percent Fenmu Shen was terrified at this moment.</p>

    <p>Could this Wang Jiao... be a cultivator at the 200 millionth level of body refining?</p>

    <p>In this world of cultivation, how could such an outrageous existence exist?</p>

    <p>He felt that he had to re-evaluate Father Wang's strength...</p>

    <p>The man in front of me is probably not as simple as he seems.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a human being who gave birth to two monsters in succession.</p>

    <p>Even if you think with your butt, the other party cannot be just an ordinary earthling.</p>

    <p>If you can tear his Dong Feng Bo to pieces with just your arms, then the other party must be someone who hides his secrets...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to have such strength." One percent Fenmu Shen had cold sweat on his forehead and slid down his cheeks. The atmosphere at this moment instantly became extremely solemn.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Father Wang himself was actually very panicked.</p>

    <p>As a literary and artistic worker who makes a living by keyboarding, Father Wang has always been a scholar. I don't know the last time he hit someone...</p>

    <p>He doesn't know many martial arts skills.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's just a set of the third set of radio gymnastics for High School students in the country, plus a little bit of military gymnastics.</p>

    <p>The person I'm facing now is a big shot who comes looking for trouble. At first glance, he looks like a villain.</p>

    <p>This made Father Wang feel a little nervous.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know who Fenmu Shen is...</p>

    <p>I just feel that the pressure the other party puts on me is very strong.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling hadn't inspired Father Wang's arms, Father Wang's unicorn arms would now be like two electric water pumps, bringing up Father Wang's entire body's ability to withstand stress.</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt that he would probably faint on the spot when facing Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>And the scariest thing is that Immortal Toya behind him thinks he is the real senior master.</p>

    <p>Still stoking the flames with confidence...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "This dear friend, Senior Wang's home is not a place where you can come and leave whenever you want. Senior Wang is a hidden master! He doesn't cause trouble and is not afraid of trouble! Senior Wang, always be a god!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>One Hundred Fenmu Shen crossed his arms and sneered: "Do you know who I am?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "It doesn't matter who you are. Even if you are the overlord of the universe. If Senior Wang punches you, do you dare to bear it?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>One percent Fenmu Shen frowned: "You may not believe it. I am really the overlord of the universe."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "There is only one father in this world! That is our Father Wang. Senior Wang! How dare you talk to Senior Wang like this! Why don't you kneel down and apologize to Senior Wang!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang listened to Immortal Toya's words. He seemed calm on the surface, but actually he was panicking.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not that he can't understand Immortal Toya's current mood.</p>

    <p>In the other person's heart, you are a senior master like an idol. Since you have an admiration mentality, it is actually normal to unconsciously use words to defend you in your words.</p>

    <p>This is a common item in online public opinion wars - no one can criticize my idol!</p>

    <p>However, the situation in front of him made Father Wang even more nervous. He really didn't know how to deal with it.</p>

    <p>Facing Fenmu Shen. Father Wang's pressure doubled. However, at this moment, he suddenly heard an overlapping voice in his mind.</p>

    <p>Mysterious voice: "Don't panic. We are here!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "?"</p>

    <p>It's because he was too nervous. He was hallucinating?</p>

    <p>At this time, Father Wang felt terrified and inexplicable.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous! We are your right-hand man!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang took a deep breath when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Shit! His left and right hands actually became spirits after the enlightenment!</p>

    <p>"You don't need to talk. Just communicate with us in your head! I'm Left Hand. You can call me Left. Or you can call me by my name. Kato."</p>

    <p>"I'm right-handed. You can call me Righty. Or you can call me by my first name. Eagle."</p>

    <p>"You actually have autonomous consciousness..." Father Wang was completely shocked. The thoughts in his mind kept rising and falling.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Originally, we didn't want to come out. After all, if you knew about our existence, I'm afraid we would have to help you code in the future. Having a pair of left and right hands that can move on their own is probably every author's dream."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But the situation is urgent now. Xiaoyou and I have to take action."</p>

    <p>"So who is this person?"</p>

    <p>"A person who claims to be the overlord of the universe. A living fossil that has lived for eternity. He floated up after gaining a little strength. Now his true body is fighting with Ah Nuan's differentiated shadow in the universe."</p>

    <p>"So Ah Nuan has been silent until now. Is it because he has separated his shadow and is fighting with this person's body in the universe?"</p>

    <p>"right!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't help but tremble after hearing this.</p>

    <p>He knew it!</p>

    <p>His daughter is not that easy to mess with.</p>

    <p>This one has just been born and has already begun to maintain the peace of the universe... If it grows up a little longer, it will be okay.</p>

    <p>However, Father Wang did not expect that his opponent would actually be the overlord of the universe. Although the opponent was self-proclaimed, he knew he was someone with certain abilities.</p>

    <p>His nervous mood calmed down a lot after Xiao Zuo and Xiao You woke up.</p>

    <p>Because the next step is a fully automated battle. There is no need for Father Wang to take the initiative to operate it.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fenmu Shen in front of him actually did not realize the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>"You must die today." One percent Fenmu Shen's eyes narrowed.</p>

    <p>His arm stretched out from an extremely far away place and suddenly grabbed Father Wang. His five slender fingers were like the tentacles of an octopus. At that moment, he rushed towards Father Wang.</p>

    <p>The movement was so fast. Father Wang couldn't estimate it with his naked eyes alone.</p>

    <p>But he has nothing to fear in his heart at this time!</p>

    <p>Because he believes in his son!</p>

    <p>I trust my right and left hands even more!</p>

    <p>In this small villa of the Wang family, he is the head of the family! So when his family is in danger, he naturally has to stand up and fight like a man!</p>

    <p>"Chong!!" At that moment, Father Wang's heart was boiling with excitement!</p>

    <p>He didn't say a word, but his heart was already roaring like crazy.</p>

    <p>"MUDAI MUDAI MUDAI MUDAI..."</p>

    <p>The movements of Xiao Zuo and Xiao Right were faster than 1% Fenmu Shen. A two-pronged approach. The ten fingers on the left and right began to split the moment they were stretched out. Each finger could actually derive hundreds of tentacles.</p>

    <p>Thousands of tentacles fell from the sky like meteors. They fell at an invisible speed and instantly defeated the arm of One Hundred Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Finally. Countless bombardments hit the body of one percent Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>One percent Fenmu Shen was miserable. His whole body was smoking and exuding a burnt smell. Then his whole body was disintegrated and dispersed into particles of dust...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the universe, Fenmu Shen's body spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p>
