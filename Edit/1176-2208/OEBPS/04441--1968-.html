  <h1>Chapter 1968 The human figurines of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The production of human figurines has a long history. It has developed for thousands of years from ancient cultivators to the modern scientific cultivation world. And the human figurine masters were also very prosperous at that time. They were a rising profession that kept pace with alchemists and weapon refiners.</p>

    <p>An outstanding human figurine maker. He can control the overall quality of the human figurines and the accuracy of face pinching. It is not an exaggeration to call it the hand of Nuwa.</p>

    <p>However, with the development of modern technology, most of the human figurines currently on the market are fabricated by machines.</p>

    <p>"This is it." Tieyi led Wang Ling and others to the huge cave that collapsed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling measured it with his eyes. The area that collapsed here is the size of four basketball courts.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if this was a deliberate design by Teng Luchen, or it was due to other coincidental elements that directly exposed the underground human figurine palace near Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>"Go down and have a look." Li Changzhe's eyes were slightly excited. As a young man with a flourishing spirit, he was naturally extremely interested in this type of figurines. These figurines, which combine the wisdom of modern cultivation technology, are not something that ordinary people can do. It's affordable.</p>

    <p>And now there was an entire underground palace of human figurines at their feet. At this moment, Li Changzhe suddenly had a bold idea...</p>

    <p>If these figurines in the underground palace are the sect's secrets that Wuxiang Peak deliberately stored here in order to balance the war situation, then is it possible that their infiltration this time will directly raze this underground palace to the ground?</p>

    <p>Although the specific situation in the underground palace is still unclear, and it may be difficult for one person to do this alone, there are many of them!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Zhang Linyan, the senior brother from Haoren Peak and the miners led by Tieyi!</p>

    <p>It is said that strength comes with more people. They now have a lot of materials on hand. They can make many temporary detonating symbols in a short time. As long as they calculate the blasting point, it seems that it is not a bad idea to directly overturn the underground palace!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe couldn't wait for a long time. He immediately used the mist-resolving technique to turn into a ball of smoke and go in to explore the way.</p>

    <p>"This idiot..." Zhang Linyan was speechless. She felt that Li Changzhe looked like a reckless man, but not very much. She said that he was a reckless man. He was the first to rush in and face the unknown risks inside. It was indeed reckless, but he was reckless. It doesn't seem to be very thorough. Just use the Mist Resolving Technique to test it out. Essentially, it's not a face-to-face behavior.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Wang Ling didn't be afraid. Just follow us. Li Changzhe and I will find ways to protect you." Just before Zhang Linyan was about to jump down for the second time, she faced Wang Ling. He said with great concern.</p>

    <p>"Hmm..." Wang Ling nodded helplessly.</p>

    <p>He discovered that Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe had been given the identities of disciples of the God of Arrow and disciples of the Mist God respectively. Both of them seemed to have become much more confident.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan obviously had doubts about him before. Unexpectedly, he really regarded him as a mascot now.</p>

    <p>But this is actually good. It's quite in line with Wang Ling's wishes.</p>

    <p>But soon Wang Ling realized that there were actually problems with this.</p>

    <p>Because sometimes when your "weakness" arouses a person's desire for protection, everyone else will choose to blindly follow suit and really think you are weak and try to protect you.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. If you are really scared, I can carry you down. It doesn't matter." At this time, the iron-clad old man next to Wang Ling said with a simple face. It is a posture ready to hug the Wang Ling princess.</p>

    <p>As soon as he took on this posture, a drop of cold sweat rolled down his face. He pretended not to hear Tieyi's words. He put his trouser pockets in and followed Zhang Linyan and jumped into the pit in a dashing way.</p>

    <p>As soon as they entered the pit, Wang Ling smelled a rotten smell. This was probably one of the main reasons for the explosion.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe were already using water spells to purify the surrounding air.</p>

    <p>"It was the explosion caused by the rotten spiritual fruit." Zhang Linyan speculated: "When the ripe spiritual fruit falls to the ground, the speed of decay will be extremely accelerated. And because it contains the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, when the rotten fruit is fully combined with the soil. A slight external stimulus may cause a spiritual explosion."</p>

    <p>She explained as she moved deeper into the pit. The human figurine caves of the old era were similar to imperial tombs. There were always aisles with just the right width inside, and all kinds of human figurines were neatly arranged.</p>

    <p>The underground palace of human figurines that Wang Ling saw now was obviously designed in advance. A fluorescent tunnel full of technology leads directly to the depths of the underground palace. There are also countless capsule glass cabins placed along both sides of the tunnel. Inside are all Already designed human figurines.</p>

    <p>They are soaked in special spiritual liquid to prevent their bodies made of spiritual soil from being corroded and destroyed.</p>

    <p>They have exactly the same facial features. They are delicate and beautiful. They are like the protagonists in many domestic three-dimensional animations. Although everyone has a different personality, you always feel as if you have seen their facial features before.</p>

    <p>"It's amazing..." Li Changzhe was completely surprised by the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>There are a hundred human figurines displayed here in total. However, it seems that only half of the finished product is completed. The remaining half is not only missing arms and legs, but even the facial features have not been shaped.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was very courageous. He faced an unfinished glass cabin and showed a weird smile.</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do..." Zhang Linyan seemed to know what this guy was going to do.</p>

    <p>"I'm not doing anything. I'm just having fun. Didn't you see? Their faces all look the same. How boring it is." Li Changzhe said with a smile.</p>

    <p>There was three-dimensional data of human figurines on the tablet connected to the capsule cabin. Li Changzhe opened it and studied it. He found that it seemed that he could pinch the face directly by operating the tablet.</p>

    <p>Maybe he had a lot of experience in face-pinching games. Li Changzhe's grasp of face-pinching was extremely accurate. Soon he was able to pinch himself according to his facial features. The process only took five or six minutes.</p>

    <p>"It's really similar!" Zhang Linyan was dumbfounded. She stared at Li Changzhe in the cabin. Then she looked at Zhenren. It felt like she was looking in a mirror.</p>

    <p>"That's right. I'm better at micromanagement."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe smiled triumphantly. He was having a great time. He soon started pinching the face of the next figurine.</p>

    <p>This time, he created the face of a heroic young man. Different from those handsome models that remained unchanged, Li Changzhe made it lifelike, as if it was a human figurine that could be awakened at any time.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you can even give it a name! Do you want to give it a name?" After getting proficient at playing, Li Changzhe discovered new operations and began to try to modify the names of the figurines.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the word "王", he was pressed by Zhang Linyan: "What do you want to do? Don't make a prank!"</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's just for fun. Don't be so serious. How about you name it Wang Ling?" Li Changzhe raised his eyebrows and gave up his position.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the character "王" whose surname had been entered into the famous characters. He thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>He didn't delete the last name. Instead, he directly added the full name at the end.</p>

    <p>Together they are...Wang Yuanxi.</p>
