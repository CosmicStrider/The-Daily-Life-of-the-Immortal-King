  <h1>Chapter 1858 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just a few hours ago. Wang Ling had a "cordial and friendly conversation" with Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>Of course. The person who spoke was Wang Ying. And Wang Ling just asked a question for Wang Ying to convey. He was just listening on the side.</p>

    <p>This directly caused Emperor Dongda to sweat on his back throughout the entire questioning process.</p>

    <p>Compared to Wang Ling. Wang Ying doesn't have such a good temper. He doesn't spoil Emperor Dongda either. He shows his extreme temper from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Every sharp question made Emperor Dongda shiver all over.</p>

    <p>He once suspected that he might have invited a "God of Zaun" to take over him.</p>

    <p>"What you mean is that you also followed other people's instructions and set up this situation. In fact, you don't know who the person who ordered you is. Then you brought me here to have a secret talk. And talk about your ghosts."</p>

    <p>In the Sutra Pavilion, Emperor Dongda sat on the futon obediently, accepting Wang Ying's scolding.</p>

    <p>"I swear by the dignity of my great emperor. Everything I say is true."</p>

    <p>"That man pointed me in a dream. It was just an outline...I couldn't see his appearance clearly."</p>

    <p>At this point, Emperor Dongda himself felt very aggrieved. He couldn't help but sigh: "I thought that after ascending to the throne, I would be invincible under the Dao Ancestor Wang... But unexpectedly, there are mountains beyond the mountains of the path to cultivation."</p>

    <p>"Being guided by a powerful person is also something I happened to encounter accidentally. He can make plans across eternity. How can a person with such ability be something that I can spy on."</p>

    <p>"So I really know nothing about his identity. Great God should understand...just like me. I also know nothing about your identity."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ying smiled and said: "Ha. You are holding a bowl of water very evenly. Then let me ask you. Is it possible that this is Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>"In terms of his behavior, it doesn't look like what Dao Ancestor Wang did."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda shook his head and said: "Dao Ancestor has always been provocative in his work. Every movement he makes is earth-shattering and he hopes others will know about it."</p>

    <p>"He is confident enough in his strength. That's why he dares to do this."</p>

    <p>"Therefore, Dao Ancestor's old man's style. He has always been a fast-break type. Try to decide the outcome in the shortest possible time. Seize the day and night."</p>

    <p>"Although the possibility of a long-term layout cannot be ruled out, this possibility is very low in my opinion."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling heard these words in secret, he was unable to refute them for a while.</p>

    <p>Because based on what we know so far, Dao Ancestor Wang does seem to have such a personality.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the operation of using the Supreme Corpse Map to find various excuses to imprison all the Eternals he could find in a short period of time would not have happened.</p>

    <p>On the surface, this behavior seems to be Dao Ancestor Wang being unreasonable. However, Wang Ling has also made a judgment on this matter before. He believed that Dao Ancestor Wang did this completely intentionally.</p>

    <p>There is a great possibility that it is because they are worried that the Eternal One will be destroyed like the Old Dominator and the Dragon Clan. Therefore, they thought of this method to continue the fire.</p>

    <p>So Dao Ancestor Wang must have realized something back then and made such an extreme move.</p>

    <p>He even went to the extent of ruining his own reputation and causing those Eternals imprisoned in the Corpse Map to have concentrated hatred towards him...</p>

    <p>"I've been talking for a long time, just talking useless nonsense! Let me ask you, have you seen Dao Ancestor Wang? Where is this old turtle now? Can you see him?" Wang Ying said impatiently.</p>

    <p>Actually called Dao Ancestor Wang old turtle...</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was shocked. He continued to wipe his sweat.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it was just as he had guessed. This great master is not vain at all. Not Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would never be possible to speak like this.</p>

    <p>"We, the four emperors, have all met Dao Ancestor. How can I put it...he seems to be a kinder person than expected. He is a humble gentleman."</p>

    <p>"Said to be Dao Ancestor. But in fact he is not as old as he thought. Full of kindness."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda said with a hint of reminiscence: "But Dao Ancestor's whereabouts are mysterious. Unless he comes to see us on his own initiative, even the Emperor will not be able to find him."</p>

    <p>"Moreover, he never interfered in the affairs between our four emperors. Even when there was a big commotion, he never intervened."</p>

    <p>"So this crisis in the Eastern Territory. I don't think it was Dao Ancestor who did it..."</p>

    <p>After asking for a long time, there seemed to be no useful information. Both Wang Ling and Wang Ying were a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>However, this experience was not completely fruitless.</p>

    <p>At least it helps them better understand the structure of the world of cultivation and the distribution of forces in the Eternal Period. It will help in the subsequent construction of Wang Ling regarding the Eternal Utopia.</p>

    <p>The scene fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was sweating. Suddenly he asked anxiously: "Master! Master, are you still there..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "I've been asking for a long time. You don't have any information. I'm ready to leave."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "Don't, Great God! You have to stay a few more days! Tomorrow there will be a meeting of the four emperors at the Trade Star in the Central Region. I also want to write this matter in the diary. If you leave now, the content is not correct!"</p>

    <p>"That's your later diary. Does it have anything to do with us?" Wang Ying laughed.</p>

    <p>"Because I am going to write in my diary. I want to reveal the Supreme Light Kongque Mingwang on the trading star... If you leave, won't this matter be impossible? It can't be done. That will affect the trajectory of history! "</p>

    <p>"Then destroy it. I'm tired..."</p>

    <p>"Don't! Great God!"</p>

    <p>When Emperor Dongda heard that Wang Ying was leaving so decisively, he was so anxious that tears welled up in his eyes: "It's only two days from tomorrow. Please stay for two more days at most!"</p>

    <p>"The meeting of the four emperors is very important. Because it involves some compensation payments from the Western Region to our Eastern Region... If we don't show the Dharma and demonstrate, then the Western Emperor will not be afraid of me at all."</p>

    <p>It is hard to believe that Emperor Dongda, who was full of imperial majesty in front of outsiders, still has this side in the Sutra Pavilion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh inwardly at this lowly and begging look.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Wang Ling is still very curious about the world of eternal cultivation.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the gathering of the Four Emperors and the events on the trading star also sound very interesting.</p>

    <p>I wonder if there is any Eternal World crispy noodles for sale on this trading planet...</p>

    <p>So. After another two or three minutes of silence, Wang Ying received a positive reply from Wang Ling, which he conveyed on his behalf.</p>

    <p>"Then it will only take two days at most. Once those two days are up, I will leave." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Okay, great master! I, this emperor, would like to thank you..."</p>

    <p>"Emperor? Emperor of emperors?" Wang Ying chuckled.</p>

    <p>"No way. He's my younger brother's younger brother."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda reacted quickly: "Brother! I'm counting on you!"</p>

    <p>"Who is your eldest brother? You are good at making connections."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying couldn't help laughing: "What other plans are there? We seem to have almost finished talking."</p>

    <p>"Well. I'm going to meet Jiao Yang later. Brother should know that I didn't execute her before... Of course. If she wants to live in the future, she must not use the identity of the goddess Jiao Yang again."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda said: "So, I deleted her memory and used the Suzaku Fire to modify her appearance. After the fire marks are healed, she will look completely new."</p>

    <p>"And now. I'm going to meet her. And give her a new identity..."</p>

    <p>"A daughter of a rebel. Why did you do this?" Wang Ying was curious. This is also a question that Wang Ling is curious about.</p>

    <p>"Because. She is my daughter..."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>
