  <h1>Chapter 1939 Suspicious Trajectory</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A large number of disciples from the Office of Strategic Deception poured into the command post. This was something Teng Luchen never expected.</p>

    <p>Not only that, the power supply to the command post was also cut off. At the moment when disciples from the Office of Strategic Deception rushed in, all the electronic equipment on site, including monitoring, were instantly turned off. It was plunged into darkness.</p>

    <p>"Be honest! Don't resist!"</p>

    <p>These Office of Strategic Deception disciples are elite.</p>

    <p>They were obviously well prepared. They used the contact lenses they wore with night vision capabilities to accurately rescue every researcher at the scene.</p>

    <p>It only took less than a minute from the power cut off to the activation of the backup power supply. When the lights in the command post came back on, the gangster leader holding the Golden Wind had been knocked unconscious by Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"True Immortal Ninth Level Peak." Teng Luchen frowned. He had never seen Fang Xing look like a woman. But from Fang Xing's clothes, he could already tell that he was an elder-level figure in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In such a state, he is probably still a great elder.</p>

    <p>He realized that he had underestimated the intelligence gathering capabilities of the Office of Strategic Deception. He felt that he had done a flawless job in this matter.</p>

    <p>Originally, he had a plan to test Wang Ling. But this time, a gangster with no eyesight happened to attack, allowing him to carry out the plan smoothly.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Teng Luchen was very cautious during the kidnapping. While stabilizing the mentality of the gangsters, he also completely blocked the news.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, not even the police knew about the hijacking of the Jiutian Command Post.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception was able to receive the news in advance and send someone to rush here.</p>

    <p>This made Teng Luchen feel that things suddenly became very unusual.</p>

    <p>"I am here on the order of the sect master. I have met Senior Teng. I am the Great Elder of the Office of Strategic Deception. Elder Teng, please call me Xiao Fang."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing bowed and saluted. He was polite and decent. His smiling face made it impossible to find anything wrong.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen was a little angry because the intervention of the Office of Strategic Deception actually ruined his plan. But in this case, he could only remain silent and eat Coptis chinensis.</p>

    <p>After holding it in for a long time, he finally cleared his throat and said, "It's okay. Thank you for your hard work, Xiao Fang..."</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao, I have already checked. This golden wind is fake."</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing finished speaking, he handed the pistol to Teng Luchen with both hands: "Teng Lao is still working on official duties so late. Maybe he is tired. Please take a rest early. Although it is true that cultivators can never sleep. But As the backbone of Shangfeng, Mr. Teng has to take care of his own body."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, the corner of Teng Tianyuan's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>He could probably tell that Elder Fang from the Office of Strategic Deception obviously meant something in his words.</p>

    <p>I would like to ask if he, a "pillar at the top of the mountain," can tell that this Golden Wind is fake?</p>

    <p>Since you can see it's fake and pretend to be kidnapped, isn't it obvious that there is another purpose?</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen felt a little aggrieved. He looked at the dark screen behind him and sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>When he reopened the screen, he found that the battle in the spirit world was over.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming received the order from the Office of Strategic Deception to go to the rescue, he immediately adjusted the code and used the spirit world system to teleport away the high-level spiritual beasts transferred from the subsequent map.</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter which of the elite high school students present takes action to destroy the remaining spiritual beasts, it won't be too strange.</p>

    <p>What a pity...</p>

    <p>Just a little bit away. He might be able to witness Wang Ling take action with his own eyes.</p>

    <p>However, although the power supply of the monitoring equipment was cut off just now, the spirit world system is still operating normally. In other words, during the time when the screen went black, the internal monitor was still operating.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen felt that there might be some new information about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He would have to find a way to retrieve this part of the information later and take a look.</p>

    <p>Even if the picture is not preserved, at least the recording is still there...</p>

    <p>He has suspected Wang Ling for a long time. Not just a day or two. He will not give up the investigation of Wang Ling easily.</p>

    <p>And in this current situation...</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen even had some doubts. This time, the Office of Strategic Deception suddenly received news of an operation to break out of the command post to rescue them. It was most likely a cover-up.</p>

    <p>It may even be to cover Wang Ling's actions...</p>

    <p>All this was too coincidental. It was as if it was calculated. It made Teng Luchen suspicious.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Teng Luchen pretended to be calm on the surface. He waved to call a staff member. He put the Golden Wind in a plastic envelope and said, "This toy will be left to you for safekeeping for the time being."</p>

    <p>"Okay Mr. Teng." The staff member nodded.</p>

    <p>"Have you called the police?" Teng Luchen asked.</p>

    <p>The staff member glanced at Fang Xing and said, "The police car arrived at the same time as Elder Fang broke out. The command post is now surrounded by water."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teng Luchen was silent for a moment. Then he could only scratch his head. He secretly shouted "That's it" and left the command post.</p>

    <p>It is not convenient for him to directly explain the monitoring of data here.</p>

    <p>Because the sudden action of the Office of Strategic Deception just now has made Teng Luchen suspect that there is an insider delivering the message in the command center.</p>

    <p>Now he can no longer trust anyone.</p>

    <p>Surveillance and recording data. Then hand them over to Jing Heqiu and ask for them before handing them over to him. This is the safest way.</p>

    <p>There are too many doubts...</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen found it funny.</p>

    <p>When he walked to the gate of the command post, he suddenly saw a familiar figure.</p>

    <p>He was being interviewed by the media. Zhuo Yi was crazily illuminated by countless flashlights.</p>

    <p>He almost forgot.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi also has practical relevance to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Essentially, he also belongs to the Grand Elder of the Founding Sect in the Office of Strategic Deception. But it is just an honorary title and has no actual job relationship.</p>

    <p>He remembered that Zhuo Yi was sent there by Huaxiu Alliance. His job was to inspect and supervise. It was justifiable.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Office of Strategic Deception itself is also within the jurisdiction of Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>Although the Office of Strategic Deception ruined his plan this time, Teng Luchen found that he really couldn't blame the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>After all, the Jiutian Jingmi Yuan command post was donated by gangsters. This matter is of great importance. The Office of Strategic Deception had previously signed an official city security agreement with Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>This move is actually very common everywhere. It is mainly to share the pressure of the Xiuzhen Police Station system. However, the sects that can sign such an agreement must be above the heaven level.</p>

    <p>Before the interview was over, Zhuo Yi saw Teng Luchen. He quickly asked the deputy general manager next to him to take over the interview and trotted over.</p>

    <p>"Greetings to Mr. Teng." He bowed to Teng Luchen and said respectfully, "It is said that these gangsters are very vicious. From the looks of it, Mr. Teng is not injured. This junior can rest assured."</p>

    <p>"Heh. Your information is quite good."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen smiled dryly: "Let me talk about it first. Even if you have nothing to do to be attentive, I can't help you with the election of the new leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance."</p>

    <p>"The position of alliance leader depends on one's ability. Mr. Teng is so caring. I am deeply grateful to this junior." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen sighed and had no choice but to leave.</p>

    <p>He frowned.</p>

    <p>Suspicious...</p>

    <p>Everything is so fishy...</p>
