  <h1>Chapter 2172 Immortal King's Farming Daily</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After hours of hard work, Wang Ling has a preliminary understanding of the concept of the entire Itinerant Immortal game world. While other players are still working hard to level up in this world, I hope to encounter various immortals. When it comes to meeting fate or unlocking hidden tasks to improve yourself. Wang Ling has embarked on a unique path.</p>

    <p>For other players, this is a torturous leveling routine.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, this is the daily farming life of the immortal king.</p>

    <p>Including using Fuyun Town as an important base to directly shoot the first shot in the game world. Focusing the attention of many players in the game world on such an inconspicuous novice village. All this is in the game chess game of Wang Ling within.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's point of view, this is actually quite similar to establishing a sect. Wang Ling also learned a lot when Lord Diulei established the sect.</p>

    <p>The help he provided to Lord Diulei was trivial. He chose Feng Shui, expanded the underground spiritual veins of the Office of Strategic Deception, selected outstanding talents, found candidates to form the elder board of the Office of Strategic Deception, and enriched the Office of with spells written at random. Strategic Deception's Sutra Pavilion. The Office of Strategic Deception, the first super sect in modern times, directly won the throne of the first sect in the Sutra Pavilion in proportion of heaven-level spells in less than a year after its establishment.</p>

    <p>These things are just things that Wang Ling can do with a little effort.</p>

    <p>Establishing a sect is not difficult at all for Wang Ling. He can even master the ability to shape a world.</p>

    <p>So for Wang Ling, an immortal king with social phobia, the most difficult thing is social interaction.</p>

    <p>There is a saying that if you don't lead a team, you can only work until you die.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling naturally understands the reason.</p>

    <p>Expanding business in Fuyun Town seems to Wang Ling to be essentially the same as establishing a sect. The whole process is quite similar. Expand the scale of the city. Recruit troops and absorb talents. Then find a way to make the entire town bigger.</p>

    <p>After all, Itinerant Immortal is a game that highly restores the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling is just glad that he brought Sun Rong with him.</p>

    <p>Otherwise he would have to deal with so many people. He is really a bit confused. In terms of interpersonal communication, Wang Ling has not inherited the natural social attributes of Father Wang and Mother Wang at all.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, it takes a lot of courage to say more than one word to anyone, especially to strangers whom they don't know.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling discovered that he actually doesn't know how to say no. Sometimes Wang Ling would even convince himself of the mistakes made by strangers.</p>

    <p>For example, when ordering a takeaway, if the takeaway boy makes the wrong delivery, Wang Ling sees that it is getting late, and will make up a story in his mind about the takeaway boy who worked hard outside all day and made a mistake while busy.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling's choice is to order another takeaway. I won't complain to this guy... Life is not easy for anyone. Long live your understanding.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the main hall of the General's Mansion. Sun Rong has completely transformed this place into a modern conference room structure.</p>

    <p>The huge long table. The plaque in the main hall was removed and replaced with a floor-to-ceiling projection. All these equipment were purchased from the Future Technology City. Today's Fuyun Town can be said to be the small heart of the entire Itinerant Immortal world.</p>

    <p>This small place connects almost all players together.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is sitting in the center near the door. Sun Rong is sitting next to him like a secretary. Lao Huang is introducing the current situation of Fuyun Town to the two of them at the front while working together. Latest situation.</p>

    <p>"Currently, talents from all major cultivator guilds are vying to enter Fuyun Town. There are also some commercial guilds among them. These players all made their fortune by moving bricks and mortar."</p>

    <p>"What is... moving bricks?" Sun Rong asked, raising his hand.</p>

    <p>"To put it simply, they are the props required in some fixed plots in the game. These props are relatively fixed. Many new players do not have access to them, or are too lazy to collect them themselves. They can directly purchase these props through these brick-moving guilds. Plot props. Of course. The market price of these props is usually relatively cheap. New players can also afford them."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang explained: "Generally speaking, they are relatively basic plot props such as spiritual plants and spiritual mines.</p>

    <p>More advanced brick-moving players can collect spiritual plants and refine them into elixirs. Or they can advance the spiritual mines and use them to refine magic weapons. "That's it." Sun Rong tapped his hand. It felt like a sudden change in his mind. The vision inside became much clearer.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened to Lao Huang's explanation with a calm expression. After all, Mr. Zanghu was already responsible for promoting the business development of elixirs. With his incomparable knowledge reserve, Zanghu The gentleman is like a fish in water.</p>

    <p>"In addition to the large number of these commercial guilds settling in Fuyun Town, the trade exchanges between Fuyun Town and other cities have also hit new highs. At present, they have received official cooperation from other novice village maps. All are directly ordered by the city owner players."</p>

    <p>"City Lord?" Wang Ling was confused.</p>

    <p>"According to the rules of the Itinerant Immortal magic ring. Players in the city can vote for the city leader in a referendum. The city leader's term is one month. During this period, players can also impeach the city leader. But whether the city leader takes office or is impeached, he needs to get more than three points. Player votes of two."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said: "At the same time, players who are eligible to vote also have relevant regulations. They cannot leave this city for too long. They must have close contacts with this city in the past month. And their consumption in this city must not be less than Less than 100,000 taels."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong heard this and nodded at the same time.</p>

    <p>This rule can be said to be very reasonable.</p>

    <p>Even the world of Itinerant Immortal is a world where taxes are paid according to law. Where there is consumption, there is taxation. Let taxpayers vote to decide the players who will lead the city to progress. It is indeed fair and reasonable.</p>

    <p>But now, facing so many invitations, Wang Ling fell into deep thought again.</p>

    <p>He knew very well. These invitations, either reject them all or accept them all. There was no other option.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know much about the ways of the world. But he knows what situations he will most likely face if he makes a choice.</p>

    <p>If only one or a few companies are accepted, then the remaining companies will definitely have a sense of crisis and form a new group. In the end, the live game will turn into a dead game of confrontation. This is not what Wang Ling wants to see.</p>

    <p>He came to the world of Itinerant Immortal. The most fundamental purpose is to assist Mr. Zanghu. He has no intention of taking over the spotlight. Everything he does is to attract the players' attention.</p>

    <p>So in the past, the choice Wang Ling made was definitely to reject them all. But now times have changed.</p>

    <p>"Accept them all, right?" After hearing the decision made by Wang Ling, Lao Huang became obviously more excited.</p>

    <p>This feeling of standing at the center of the world. He has never fought this kind of battle for wealth in eight lifetimes!</p>

    <p>At the same time. Wang Ling also stood up.</p>

    <p>He did not forget his mission.</p>

    <p>I am here to assist Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu's next goal is to use the ancient method of active volcano alchemy. Wang Ling feels it is necessary to help.</p>
