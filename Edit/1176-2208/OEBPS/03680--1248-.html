  <h1>Chapter 1248 Game within a game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Foundation. In an independent spiritual space.</p>

    <p>This time the seven ambassadors were not completely gathered. There were only five people present.</p>

    <p>"The messenger of the sun is dead. The fool betrayed us." Xu Bai, who was sitting in the judgment seat, spoke.</p>

    <p>The former is an unshakable fact, while the latter is false and no clear evidence has yet been found.</p>

    <p>But he felt that the behavior of the messenger of the Fool was a bit strange.</p>

    <p>So to be on the safe side, during this meeting in the spiritual space, he took the initiative to "kick the Fool's messenger out of the group chat."</p>

    <p>"Who is he?" Moon wondered.</p>

    <p>No one knows each other's identities.</p>

    <p>Now that the messenger of the sun is dead, the focus of everyone's attention is not how he died. What he died for.</p>

    <p>Instead, they pay more attention to his true identity.</p>

    <p>This may sound a bit ironic.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai sneered inwardly.</p>

    <p>Human beings are indeed a kind of creatures full of curiosity and self-righteousness.</p>

    <p>But now that the identity is revealed, it really doesn't hurt anymore.</p>

    <p>He was not in a hurry to speak. Instead, he looked in the direction of the star messenger and asked rhetorically: "Star, you have prophetic ability. Don't you still know the identity of the sun?"</p>

    <p>The stars are silent.</p>

    <p>He/she thought carefully for tens of seconds before speaking: "I watched the sky at night. I saw the stars falling. I know that the messenger of the sun is in danger. But I don't know his true identity."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Xu Baipo raised his eyebrows meaningfully.</p>

    <p>He no longer hides it.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai: "The true identity of the messenger of the sun is Apollo Deliman."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "It's him."</p>

    <p>Same as Keorn's reaction when he heard the name.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the mental space except Xu Bai was more or less surprised.</p>

    <p>The Moon Messenger observed a moment of silence. She made a gesture of prayer: "He was a good man."</p>

    <p>"We all know he is a good man." Chariot said at this time.</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, he changed his previous irritable attitude.</p>

    <p>Instead, he spoke in as soft a tone as possible: "Although I have differences of opinion with him, everything he and these people have done is obvious to all. We should avenge the sun! So now, we must know. He Whose hands did he die in?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Xu Bai, who was sitting in the judgment seat, knew that the meeting had finally reached its point.</p>

    <p>He unceremoniously announced the man who killed the sun.</p>

    <p>He just turned the magic ball in front of him gently. A holographic projection of a man immediately appeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>"You all know this person."</p>

    <p>Xu Bai's voice was calm.</p>

    <p>He and the chariot cooperated with each other. The purpose of arousing the emotions of the others has been fully achieved.</p>

    <p>"It's him! Zhuo Yi!" Chariot hammered the table angrily.</p>

    <p>In fact. He knew the answer last night.</p>

    <p>But as an outstanding actor, Chariot has devoted his life's acting skills at this time.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the performance was penetrating, meticulous and vivid.</p>

    <p>The manic Chariot's performance at this moment surprised everyone. They never thought that Chariot had such a tough and tender side.</p>

    <p>"Delliman has always been keen on charity. He devoted his life to helping those in need..."</p>

    <p>At this point, the sound of the chariot sounded a little choked.</p>

    <p>This is a technique he spent one night figuring out.</p>

    <p>Anyway, in this mental space, everyone is a black shadow, and their expressions cannot be seen clearly.</p>

    <p>So he just needs to focus his acting skills on shaping his voice.</p>

    <p>Xu Bai heard the choking sound of the chariot and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He feels that the tank is completely the seed for the "immersive sound" championship.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, we must do something for the sun... We cannot let the body of this great good man be left in the cold in a foreign country forever."</p>

    <p>Chariot stood up excitedly: "Kill Zhuo Yi! Revenge for the sun!"</p>

    <p>Messengers of the Moon position are always gentle.</p>

    <p>But she is most easily swayed by emotions. As a nun sent to the mortal world by God, perhaps she should not have such a strong desire for revenge.</p>

    <p>But now, guided by Chariot's emotions, she also felt pity for the dead Deliman in her heart.</p>

    <p>So soon, the messenger of the moon also expressed his opinion: "This devil must be punished! God will definitely let him get the punishment he deserves!"</p>

    <p>She said it very implicitly, but in fact she was on the side of the chariot.</p>

    <p>The trend is set.</p>

    <p>This meeting was completely a battle of denunciation for the sun messenger Deliman.</p>

    <p>The perfect coordination between Xu Bai and the chariot almost aroused the emotions of everyone here.</p>

    <p>This is also the first time that everyone's opinions are extremely unified.</p>

    <p>"Then as everyone voted, this foundation meeting voted to [Crunt Zhuo Yi]. It was unanimously approved!" In the judgment position, Xu Bai, who had the overall situation in hand, dropped his hammer.</p>

    <p>Everything is in his plan.</p>

    <p>Including Snake's invasion of the Sun Messenger's body after becoming an ethereal spirit.</p>

    <p>Including Snake's revenge plan to find Zhuo Yi, Keorn after being perfectly integrated with the body.</p>

    <p>Of course. It also includes Snake's death in battle. And Zhuo Yi picked up the void sphere...</p>

    <p>All of this was within Xu Bai's expectation.</p>

    <p>"Now, there is only one last step left to prepare for the war."</p>

    <p>In the old castle, Xu Bai tasted the red decoction.</p>

    <p>He wants to kill Zhuo Yi with the help of others in the Foundation.</p>

    <p>Let Zhuo Yi. who obtained the void sphere become a void spirit.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The epidemic prevention center site is located in the western suburbs of Songhai City.</p>

    <p>The huge barrier is like an egg shell, perfectly forming an airtight line of defense here.</p>

    <p>There is only one entrance and exit to the entire barrier. Everyone entering and exiting must be tested.</p>

    <p>And inside the barrier, there is a temporary isolation hospital created using the "Star Movement Technique" combined with the "Civil Construction Technique."</p>

    <p>Can accommodate tens of thousands of people!</p>

    <p>All wards are independent spaces created by the cooperation between Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Zhenyuan immortal people.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Keorn passed the test. As soon as they entered the command center, Cailian Zhenren, who had been waiting outside the building for a long time, quickly came over.</p>

    <p>"Something is going wrong." Cailian Zhenren looked a little ugly.</p>

    <p>"What happened? Speak slowly." Zhuo Yi took Cailian Zhenren to a secret place.</p>

    <p>"I just got the news that Zhenjun has been detained by General Alliance." Cailian Zhenren said.</p>

    <p>This news made Zhuo Yi frown slightly.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception is currently aligned with the Huaguo Shuilian Group. It is completely on the side of the Head of State.</p>

    <p>So what is certain is that the person who is detaining Lord Diulei now is the second wave of forces in the General Alliance.</p>

    <p>"True Lord will not be fooled so easily. Maybe he is trying to find a way to hook out the person behind this second wave of forces..." Zhuo Yi's mind suddenly changed. He felt that there was something fishy behind this matter.</p>

    <p>"It's true, Lord. Don't worry for now. I have something now. I need Immortal Toya-senpai to identify it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Speaking of this, he took out the magic ball that Captain Lu Liang had picked up previously.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" Cailian Zhenren was curious.</p>

    <p>"After killing the virtual spirit, the equipment exploded...</p>
