  <h1>Chapter 1961 The seedling of genius</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The separated arrow that was split into two parts was not interrupted. Instead, it was following the original flight path. Even the arrow body that was split into two parts turned pale gold.</p>

    <p>Such superb archery not only made Qu Shuling speechless, but also Teng Luchen, who was watching the battle, was stunned.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Zhang Linyan had mastered the art of "Arrow Fighting" and even strengthened the arrows in advance.</p>

    <p>"Excellent prediction ability..." Teng Luchen was surprised. His original purpose was to observe Wang Ling. But he didn't expect Zhang Linyan to be so strong.</p>

    <p>In addition to the accuracy of archery, a top archer's ability to predict the situation beforehand is also very important. There was once a hostage kidnapping case involving a high-speed train suspended above the ground.</p>

    <p>The top archers can keep the bow and arrow shooting at a speed parallel to the high-speed rail. They can also accurately calculate every turning point in the orbit.</p>

    <p>Then, when the criminal was unprepared, he suddenly accelerated and accurately hit the criminal's vital parts to rescue the hostage.</p>

    <p>But to reach that point, you have to be at least a tenth-grade top archer. Such people are usually proficient in archery, and most of their strength is above Itinerant Immortal...</p>

    <p>Who is Zhang Linyan?</p>

    <p>This is just a girl in the middle stage of Golden Core!</p>

    <p>Although she is an elite among high school students nationwide, her proficiency in archery is a bit too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>"What a young talent. At the very least, she is an eighth-level archer... She may even have reached the ninth or tenth level." Jing Heqiu also sighed.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan's performance was really outstanding. It was beyond their expectations.</p>

    <p>The two separated reinforced golden arrows rotated like tops, with a sharp edge.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling never thought that Zhang Linyan would also hide her hand. Zhang Linyan today seems to be very different from what he saw before. He clearly remembered that Zhang Linyan seemed to only have a fourth-level archer certificate. But the strength she showed now was far beyond that.</p>

    <p>Very dangerous two arrows!</p>

    <p>If it hits his vital parts, it will most likely trigger the protective mechanism and send him away directly.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling didn't dare to be disrespectful at all now. He held Zhan Ye and divided into several sword lights again. He completely gave up on continuing to track Li Changzhe. Instead, he swarmed up and concentrated on blocking Zhang Linyan's golden arrows with all his strength.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the scene, the moment the dark sword light collided with the golden arrows, a big explosion occurred. The powerful air wave shook everything around.</p>

    <p>Centered on the battlefield, the vegetation within a hundred meters radius was swept away by the storm generated by the explosion.</p>

    <p>This impact is so powerful!</p>

    <p>When Qu Shuling took back Zhan Ye again.</p>

    <p>On the dark sword body, several cracks appeared under the projection of light.</p>

    <p>This made Qu Shuling's expression turn ugly instantly.</p>

    <p>Since his competition, Zhanya has performed so many times, but he has never been damaged so seriously.</p>

    <p>The current degree of damage means that he cannot rely too much on Zhan Ye in the next battle. Otherwise, this spiritual sword will be in danger of shattering at any time.</p>

    <p>"So strong." Jing Heqiu was very sad when he saw all this.</p>

    <p>The fights among today's elite high school students are really immortal battles. The game between fists is far more exciting than the duel between high-level cultivators who fight for magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Those high-level cultivators often use magic weapons to fight on their behalf in order to save their lives. The battle is about who has the more powerful magic weapon, rather than a pure competition between strengths.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most unbelievable person among everyone present was Zhang Linyan herself.</p>

    <p>That arrow. She also saw it...</p>

    <p>As usual. It's just an ordinary arrow. Who knew it would have such an effect.</p>

    <p>The explosion just now was no different from a small nuclear explosion... The power was too amazing! It was an arrow shot far beyond her current level.</p>

    <p>"Sister Zhang is amazing. How did you do that?" At this time, Li Changzhe couldn't help but applaud.</p>

    <p>One arrow defeated the first genius Qu Shuling. He also severely damaged his natal spiritual sword Zhanye.</p>

    <p>If this matter is publicized, Zhang Linyan will immediately become famous. She may even become a new star whose fame surpasses that of Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan herself was confused: "Who is your sister Zhang..."</p>

    <p>She secretly sneered that Li Changzhe was really good at getting close. At the same time, she was also thinking carefully about what happened with the arrow she just shot.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that her hand holding the bow was the same as usual. Could it be because she had an adrenaline rush to save her teammates and shot an arrow that was beyond normal?</p>

    <p>But even if it was really a mistake, it's not that outrageous!</p>

    <p>It's not that she doesn't know how to fight with arrows. But her fighting skills with arrows are basically ineffective at times. The fourth-level archer's skill in fighting with arrows cannot be 100% successful. Now she can only do it at best. A little over 50% success rate.</p>

    <p>As for strengthening the arrows, this is even more impossible to do by herself.</p>

    <p>Apparently an arrow was split in half by Qu Shuling. As a result, it was directly strengthened!</p>

    <p>Where did this naughty operation come from...</p>

    <p>If she were Qu Shuling, she would even want to call the police!</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to be the strongest among the three of you. I underestimated you."</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling's cold voice came. He stared at Zhang Linyan. The expression on his face was one of joy of meeting his opponent.</p>

    <p>There is always sympathy between geniuses. This is especially true when you encounter an opponent who is as good as yourself.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling had not investigated Zhang Linyan before. According to Zhang Linyan's previous intelligence data, in Qu Shuling's heart, she was just an opponent who was not worthy of being called an opponent.</p>

    <p>Although she is also a top elite high school student, he has never actually taken Zhang Linyan seriously.</p>

    <p>But everything is different now.</p>

    <p>The arrow shot by Zhang Linyan just proved that this person is an out-and-out genius!</p>

    <p>"Three against one. I really underestimated the enemy."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qu Shuling stood up excitedly and pointed his sword at Zhang Linyan: "Now, I apply to compete with you one-on-one!"</p>

    <p>This scene made Wang Ling breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Finally, the operation he just made diverted Qu Shuling's eyes away from him.</p>

    <p>Facing Qu Shuling's gaze, Zhang Linyan was at a loss for words: "I..."</p>

    <p>"Are you afraid? Or do you look down on me?"</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling chuckled: "You were able to shoot the arrow just now. It just proves that your archer level is at least level six!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan: "I really don't have a sixth grade..."</p>

    <p>She was speechless. She also determined in her heart that the arrow shot just now was just a coincidence.</p>

    <p>To prove, Zhang Linyan pointed her bow at Qu Shuling again: "The arrow just now was really just a coincidence. If you don't believe it, I will shoot another arrow now. I guarantee you can catch it!"</p>

    <p>"Just grab it. What do I have to fear!" Qu Shuling sneered. Holding Zhan Ye, he waited for Zhang Linyan's performance.</p>

    <p>The arrow shot just now was so exciting. Even he wanted to watch it again and study it in depth.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan felt that if she used her strength to perform normally, she would never be able to shoot that mysterious arrow a second time...</p>

    <p>But something that went beyond all expectations.</p>

    <p>The moment the arrow fell from her hand.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The arrow actually began to multiply in size in front of everyone!</p>

    <p>The huge arrow expanded to the size of a small mountain and was heading towards Qu Shuling!</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was shocked. He even couldn't help but yelled: "Zhang Linyan! You still said you havenotalent?! How dare you lie to me!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling silently looked away.</p>
