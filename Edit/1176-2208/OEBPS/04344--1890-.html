  <h1>Chapter 1890 Sun Rong Discussion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling can see that the patterns and decorations on the body of the Peng family steward are not possessed by the eternal world. They are very obvious signs of the old world.</p>

    <p>The bottom of the pattern is surging waves woven with gold immortal and blue silk threads. Several tentacles from the old world poke out from the sea, showing a strange arc beauty.</p>

    <p>These tentacles from the Old World are too familiar to Wang Ling. Not long ago, he hunted several tentacle-like creatures from the Old World to satisfy the appetite of the newborn Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Such unscrupulousness is enough to show how domineering and rampant the Peng family is on Penglai Planet.</p>

    <p>There is only some time left before the sun completely sets. Wang Ling, Sun Rong and others' marriage proposal convoy just happened to catch up with the last round of "interviews" today while spending money all the way. Looking at the time, you can tell that they are already the last wave of people today.</p>

    <p>However, the people in the queue at the back knew that it was no longer their turn today, but they did not disperse immediately. The young talents who came to propose marriage got out of their cars and planned to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>After all, the last person being interviewed now is a rich man who used money to get all the way to the front. Many people want to see this rich man being thrown cold water by the Peng family. The gap between the rich and the poor in the world has been huge throughout the ages. But there are also many rich people. So The status of the Peng Family Headquarters on Penglai Planet is definitely something that ordinary upstarts would look down upon.</p>

    <p>So as soon as Wang Ling and others arrived, the Peng family steward's face never looked better. He also observed the fleet of Wang Ling and others for a long time. He actually bought it all the way with money?</p>

    <p>Just when the housekeeper of the Peng family had a look of disdain on his face, he saw Zhang Zhui step forward. He took out a jade box from his sleeves and pretended to be respectful, opened the jade box, and presented it with both hands: "Hello, manager. My young master is here to propose marriage this time. I hope the manager can help guide him. Please be careful. It's disrespectful. Don't be offended if you go to the manager."</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>The general manager of the Peng family showed a contemptuous smile as his contempt only increased.</p>

    <p>Ha. Do you think the Peng family is vegetarian?</p>

    <p>He hates this kind of rich nouveau riche!</p>

    <p>His dignified butler of the Peng family is also a well-known figure on Penglai planet. Many rich people don't take him seriously...</p>

    <p>A mere upstart from another planet dared to stand in front of him...</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>He didn't look closely at the contents of the box at first.</p>

    <p>After taking a quick glance, he realized that this was an elixir. And this was not an ordinary elixir!</p>

    <p>When the elixir in the jade box burst out with a dazzling luster, the manager of the Peng family quickly closed the lid of the jade box almost immediately.</p>

    <p>This vigilance is actually because he didn't want the treasure pill in the box to be seen by other people who are interested in looking at it.</p>

    <p>As the general manager of the Peng family, his eyes are extremely vicious.</p>

    <p>It is clear that this is a Dao Ancestor Pill!</p>

    <p>This is a rare elixir that breaks through the realm of Dao Ancestor! Only emperor-level figures can refine it!</p>

    <p>In fact, among the people who came to propose marriage today, there were indeed many people who came to propose marriage in the name of three-star, six-star or nine-star royal families. But people like this used Dao Ancestor Pill as a stepping stone as soon as they made a move. Even the manager of the Peng family was confused.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't like the upstart in front of him, he still couldn't help but feel a little hesitant in the face of Dao Ancestor Pill.</p>

    <p>To him, such a greeting gift is like giving him a pillow when he is drowsy. Because he has been stuck in the realm of Dao God for a long time. He is only a little bit closer to breaking through to Dao Ancestor. However, he has always lacked understanding. If there is no external force to break through, he is afraid that he will never break through in this life. The realm of the world stops here.</p>

    <p>So the next moment, his expression softened a little. He accepted the jade box in person and stood in front of the door: "Young Master, you're welcome. I accept this gift with a smile. Young Master, please come in. But there are still a few more tests to come. If all of them are passed, then it will be clear that the matchmaker is marrying my young lady. If not, the young master can consider becoming a son-in-law, or leave directly."</p>

    <p>"clear."</p>

    <p>At this time, inside the carriage, Sun Rong took a deep breath. Under the gaze of everyone, she stepped off the exclusive Royal Horse carriage of the Nine-Star Royal Family.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Sun Rong did not feel stage fright. She once fell in love with Wang Ling and tried to learn to be low-key. She also enjoyed the feeling of being in the spotlight.</p>

    <p>But now, we can only return to our old profession.</p>

    <p>As the future young owner of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, she has an innate ability to control the overall situation and confidence. This kind of magnanimity is extraordinary. In addition, Liu Qingyi and You Yueqing's exquisite makeup for Sun Rong. This immortal qualification shocked everyone in the audience just once she appeared on the stage.</p>

    <p>"This...which royal family is this from? How come I've never seen this person before?"</p>

    <p>"Look at the decorations on his body. It combines the styles of the four realms. He must have an extraordinary origin! Maybe he was favored by four emperors at the same time!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my God. Is there such a person in this world?"</p>

    <p>The busybodies on the street immediately started talking about it.</p>

    <p>To be honest, when he saw Sun Rong in person, even the manager of the Peng family was stunned for a moment. He thought that he had vast knowledge. He recognized almost all the famous families in the four major regions, but he didn't even remember that there was such a person!</p>

    <p>The logo pattern of the four domains is directly tattooed on the same robe. This alone is enough to prove that this person's identity is of great importance!</p>

    <p>"Before the young master comes in, please tell me who the young master is?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Wang Rongxia." Sun Rong answered without thinking.</p>

    <p>Her identity is completely fake. It was created by the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception who played the four emperors. Therefore, everything about this false identity has been made watertight.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has already been thought of.</p>

    <p>This is through the name of her character, Xia Zinian, which is a homophone of her own name and the surname of the person she likes.</p>

    <p>"Wang Rongxia..." The manager of the Peng family chewed the name carefully and began to dig through it in his mind. However, he seemed to have lost his memory. He could not remember anything.</p>

    <p>No matter how he searched through the memories of those famous families, he could not find such a person... Of course, he also began to wonder whether Sun Rong was a forged identity. However, even if it was a forged identity, the price It's a bit too big!</p>

    <p>A Dao Ancestor pill serves as a stepping stone. What a wealth. It doesn't look like a fake at all...</p>

    <p>Therefore, the housekeeper of the Peng family finally stopped blocking him and welcomed him in: "It turns out to be Mr. Wang Rongxia. Then please come in, Mr. Wang."</p>

    <p>Anyway, there are still a few levels to come. He feels that Sun Rong may not pass.</p>

    <p>The person in charge of the first level was a middle-aged man who looked like a scholar. He sat in front of a desk. He crossed his fingers and held his chin, looking at Sun Rong. He glanced at the chair in front of the desk and gave a meaningful smile: "Sir, please sit down. If you want to marry my young lady, the first step is to discuss the Tao."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>On the carriage before. Emperor Dongda had actually guessed this link.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man nodded. Then he began to ask the question: "There are thousands of ways to cultivate. How should I find my own way, sir?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a moment and replied: "There is no way in this world. With people, there is a way."</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man was obviously stunned when he heard this: "Young Master, that's a good answer... Then let me ask you, Master, if someone is unable to break through and can't feel the hope, what would you think?"</p>

    <p>"Hope is attached to existence. When there is existence, there is hope. When there is hope, there is light."</p>

    <p>"Good...easy to understand..."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man was completely confused. He scratched his head and continued to ask: "How do you understand life and death, sir?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "The life of death has decayed. I rejoice greatly in this decay. For by this I know that it is not empty..."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man was shocked: "Young Master is young. Why would you say such a thing?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong laughed: "Is this also a question?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man shook his head: "No. It's just my personal question. You don't have to answer it, sir."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "They are all well-taught by their tutors."</p>

    <p>Middle-aged man: "May I ask who your master is? What Taoist sect is it?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled: "There is no family or sect. He is known as Brother Xun."</p>
