  <h1>Chapter 1795 Madam Lawen's Invitation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Shopping is always the key to stimulating the secretion of dopamine in humans. Especially when shopping is free of charge, the secretion of dopamine will increase to a peak value.</p>

    <p>When people from Number 60 High School came to the supermarket entrance with large and small bags to check out, the sales clerk was first frightened by the mountains of goods behind them.</p>

    <p>This... what the hell is shopping?</p>

    <p>Are you sure it's not clearance?</p>

    <p>The sales clerk was a little shocked. He was stunned for a while before he came to his senses. He called several colleagues over to help scan the product barcodes.</p>

    <p>This incident directly alarmed the sales general manager of Walwolf Supermarket and immediately stepped down to direct the work.</p>

    <p>They are very skillful in their actions. After scanning the barcode, they directly put the goods into storage bags one by one. According to the preferential regulations of Walwolf Supermarket, if you purchase goods worth more than 100,000 yuan at a time, you can get free space storage bags for packaging. Storage bags are completely free of charge.</p>

    <p>It took half an hour to sort out the goods. In the end, the total consumption amount that popped up on the monitor was 269 million.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, madam, how do you pay?" the sales manager asked while trying to control his crazy smile.</p>

    <p>"Swipe your card. Also, I want to ask, can I buy your supermarket directly?" Sun Rong took out a crystal card with an unknown limit from her wallet.</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone in Number 60 High School felt that Sun Rong's whole body was glowing... Yes. There was a holy radiance surging all over her body. It was like eight wings descending from the sky. Holy angel.</p>

    <p>The reason why she wants to buy a supermarket. Sun Rong wanted to buy a supermarket was not a temporary idea, but she had an idea.</p>

    <p>At present, Huaguo Shuilian Group has acquired the largest hotel chain Volute in Glio City. If it can continue to acquire Walwolf, it will be able to achieve the joint development of the hotel and supermarket industries.</p>

    <p>And once Wolwolf is acquired, the Huaguo Shuilian Group will have another huge channel for exporting elixirs to foreign countries.</p>

    <p>Of course, Sun Rong also knew very well that the purchase of a supermarket was not something that a sales manager could decide. So she just asked casually while swiping her card, not expecting any answer at all.</p>

    <p>As a result, the sales manager said: "This... the supermarket acquisition. I can't make the decision. But Miss Sun is lucky today. Our boss happened to be inspecting the store today! Miss Sun led her friends to spend a lot of money today. Our boss happens to also want to meet Miss Sun. And..."</p>

    <p>At this point, the sales manager turned his attention to Wang Ling and Wang Muyu: "Our boss said that she knows the two gentlemen with dead fish eyes at the back."</p>

    <p>"Is your boss a boy or a girl?" Sun Rong asked, stunned.</p>

    <p>"Female..."</p>

    <p>"Female?" Sun Rong suddenly became nervous.</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone in Number 60 High School turned their attention to Wang Ling and Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Now even Wang Ling became nervous.</p>

    <p>"No way Wang Ling... Could it be that you, Wang Muyu, and the supermarket owner..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao made a bold guess: "So you are really Wang Muyu's father?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned pale.</p>

    <p>"Stop teasing Wang Ling. You'll scare the child." Li Youyue didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>"Who is your boss?" Sun Rong asked again.</p>

    <p>"I don't know if, has Ms. Sun heard of Mrs. Lawen's name?" the sales manager said.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Wang Ling and Wang Muyu suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>This is the lady they met in the coffee shop yesterday.</p>

    <p>At that time, Fenlei of Glio City also introduced to Wang Ling that this Mrs. Lawen should be a well-known local cultivation variety show producer in Glio City.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't expect that Mrs. Lawen was actually the boss behind this Wolwolf.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"It's right here everyone."</p>

    <p>Finally, the kind-looking sales manager brought everyone from Number 60 High School upstairs to the office on the top floor of Walwolf. Wang Ling indeed saw the Mrs. Lawen whom she had met in the coffee shop before.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Little brother, we meet again. You are so cute!" As soon as she saw Wang Muyu, she couldn't help but feel the brilliance of motherhood.</p>

    <p>Perhaps aware of her gaffe, Mrs. Lawen quickly readjusted herself: "Ahem. Everyone, please take a seat. Come here. Quickly pour coffee for these distinguished guests."</p>

    <p>"Yes." The secretary next to him responded quickly. Then he stepped back to do some work.</p>

    <p>After a while of pleasantries, Mrs. Lawen went straight to the topic: "As expected of the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Miss Sun Rong. Her spending is indeed generous."</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Lawen won the award. To be honest, I was a little surprised. I only heard that you are a famous variety show producer. I didn't expect that you are also running the supermarket business." Sun Rong responded in a low-key and humble manner.</p>

    <p>"Business has always been my strong point. People are destined to have many identities in this life. In fact, even I didn't expect that my identity as a variety show producer would become popular. It also made me a lot of money."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen picked up the coffee cup and said, with a calm and elegant manner like a lady: "I heard. Miss Sun wants to buy my Walwolf?"</p>

    <p>"There is such a plan." Sun Rong nodded: "But Mrs. Lawen's supermarket only uses money. She shouldn't be able to sell it easily, right?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun is indeed smart."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen smiled and said: "I don't care about money at all, money and me are like floating clouds, what do I need so much money for, I can't even use it up. After enjoying life enough, what I want most now is to find some fun for the rest of my boring life. That's why I've embarked on the path of a variety show producer."</p>

    <p>"So. What conditions does Mrs. Lawen have?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, don't worry. Just listen to what I have to say."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen said: "The wise don't speak secretly. Miss Sun should be very clear about her situation now. The church and Chilan Society have successively attacked Miss Sun. As a result, Miss Sun and your classmates have been restricted to Glio City, they cannot return home."</p>

    <p>"If at this time, I sell the supermarket to you, this is actually an act of taking sides."</p>

    <p>"Of course. What I am saying to Miss Sun now does not mean that I am afraid of these two forces. I just want Miss Sun to understand my sincerity."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Mrs. Lawen stood up slowly. Then she looked in the direction of everyone at Number 60 High School with expectant eyes: "I have only one request. That is for all of you, Number 60 High School, to participate in the recording of a variety show together with representatives of the elites chosen by another local cultivation high school in our city of Glio. As long as the recording ends successfully, I will transfer all the shares of Glio City to Ms. Sun. For the rest, I don't want a penny."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong frowned slightly and said with some confusion: "I want to know. Why does Mrs. Lawen take a fancy to our Number 60 High School?"</p>
