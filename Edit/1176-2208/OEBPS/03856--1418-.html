  <h1>Chapter 1418 A text message recorded in history</h1>

  <div>



<p>[Gray Cult decree: All teachers immediately rush to the designated Gray Cult cooperative cafe for important meeting discussions! No absence is allowed without necessary reasons! Otherwise, Gray Cult. will be expelled and regarded as a black fan of classmate Wang Ling!]</p>

<p>This is a text message posted by Sun Rong as a leader.</p>

<p>In fact, it's not a very important meeting. But everyone who attends the meeting can receive a red envelope reward... It's not too bad to say the least.</p>

<p>Giving out money is the most practical thing. This way it can be ensured that most of the grassroots in Gray Cult will not have any objections.</p>

<p>To a girl, money is like dung.</p>

<p>It would be very convenient if Wang Ling could be sent away by Jiang Yingying by distributing money.</p>

<p>Because there is no need to rack your brains to predict operations in advance. Calculate the opponent's action plan and formulate countermeasures...</p>

<p>But for Sun Rong, it doesn't matter if it's a little troublesome.</p>

<p>It's better than watching Wang Ling being harassed by other girls!</p>

<p>When Jiang Yingying received the fatwas, he hurried to the nearby cafe where he collaborated with Gray Cult. There were already Gray Cult clerks waiting there.</p>

<p>These officers are all volunteers. Some of them are not students in the school. They were all attracted by Wang Ling's composition and joined voluntarily.</p>

<p>Having these volunteers working in teaching is actually a good thing for some students who are busy with their studies. Volunteers can help with management.</p>

<p>"What important meeting did the leader announce?" Jiang Yingying hurried to the cafe. She saw many students from schools nearby. They all hurriedly ran out during their lunch break and gathered here.</p>

<p>"What's so important? Did classmate Wang Ling publish some new composition?"</p>

<p>There were both men and women among the people who came, but most of them were literature lovers.</p>

<p>"No. Actually, it's not that important." said a volunteer officer. He is actually the director of this cafe.</p>

<p>The curator had a smile on his face: "Actually, the new leader has come to give everyone benefits. After everyone signs in, they can come to me to receive a red envelope of 1,000 yuan as a creative fund."</p>

<p>"New leader?" Jiang Yingying looked puzzled. He seemed not to know about this yet.</p>

<p>"The handover of the new leader was completed in the morning. The old leader stepped back and became the deputy leader. He felt that the new leader was more qualified than him. He should be the one who can take the position! Moreover, the new leader has strong financial resources. It can also help Gray Cult develop better. "The curator said with a smile.</p>

<p>He spoke in favor of Sun Rong. Of course, he also received benefits.</p>

<p>This is the danger of a money-oriented society...</p>

<p>However, Jiang Yingying is still relatively simple. She doesn't understand why so many things happened when she came to Number 60 High School to register for school in the morning!</p>

<p>"Classmate Jiang. This is yours." The curator distributed the cash red envelopes and immediately registered Jiang Yingying's name.</p>

<p>It wasn't until she received the red envelope that Jiang Yingying realized that she seemed to have been fooled!</p>

<p>She had clearly been hooking up with her classmate Wang Ling in the cafeteria before.</p>

<p>As a result, I suddenly received an urgent message from the leader of Gray Cult...</p>

<p>In addition, the new leader was so generous. This almost reminded Jiang Yingying of the number one enemy she faced after she transferred to Number 60 High School this time!</p>

<p>Sun Rong!</p>

<p>The new leader. It must be her!</p>

<p>"Damn... what a cunning woman!" Jiang Yingying gritted her teeth in frustration.</p>

<p>She wanted to loudly denounce this blatant bribery in the cafe.</p>

<p>But when she saw everyone who received the red envelopes had a smiling expression on their face, the girl immediately understood... She was still too young.</p>

<p>All I can say is that he is worthy of being the future helmsman of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

<p>This method of winning people's hearts is indeed a clever one.</p>

<p>She doesn't have that much money. And Jiang Yingying is too embarrassed to ask her grandfather to help with such a thing.</p>

<p>So I had to find another way.</p>

<p>Jiang Yingying will never give up!</p>

<p>"Sun Rong. Let's see!" Jiang Yingying hummed in his heart.</p>

<p>Then. He put the red envelope back into his pocket...</p><p>...</p>



<p>On the other side. In the student union. It took Sun Rong a long time to calm down.</p>

<p>Wang Ling...actually sent her a text message...</p>

<p>This is the first time!</p>

<p>A first that can go down in history!</p>

<p>She was so happy. Her joy was beyond words. It made Sun Rong have to apply {cooling technique} on herself.</p>

<p>The more times this happens, the less likely we are to be dazzled by victory!</p>

<p>For Sun Rong, the battle now has just begun.</p>

<p>It will be a problem after Jiang Yingying officially enters the school tomorrow.</p>

<p>This is her number one concern.</p>

<p>In addition, the second biggest trouble is the girl from Sun Island. Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

<p>This person. Sun Rong is actually no stranger.</p>

<p>Because the Huaguo Shuilian Group actually has close business dealings with the Jiugong family.</p>

<p>Once at the company's annual meeting. The Jiugong family also sent Jiugong Liangzi to attend. I had a meeting with Sun Rong.</p>

<p>Sun Rong I didn't expect that the Jiugong family would make a decision this year. They sent Jiugong Liangzi to study in Huaxiu. And they also chose Number 60 High School...</p>

<p>Is this a coincidence?</p>

<p>Or is it that Jiugong Liangzi's goal from the beginning was for himself or someone from Number 60 High School?</p><p>...</p>



<p>On the way back from school. Sun Rong stared at the "thank you" message on her phone. She blushed all the way.</p>

<p>This text message was so precious. She had written it down in her "little notebook" to prevent it from being lost.</p>

<p>If mood can symbolize the weather, then Sun Rong behind the car is sunny. But Jiang Xiaoche driving in front is covered in rain...</p>

<p>This strong contrast made Sun Rong feel a little uncomfortable: "Brother Xiaoche hasn't adjusted yet?"</p>

<p>Jiang Xiaoche sighed: "I lost another 300 accounts..."</p>

<p>"I told you a long time ago. I have to change my method! Continuous harassment like this will definitely not work!" Sun Rong was in a good mood. He planned to try to give Jiang Xiaoche some advice: "Who is that girl?"</p>

<p>"Jiang Yingying..." Jiang Xiaoche muttered the name feebly.</p>

<p>"Jiang Yingying???"</p>

<p>Sun Rong thought he heard it wrong. He was stunned for a moment.</p>

<p>She was filled with surprise.</p>

<p>Could it be that this world is really that small...</p>
    
<p>"Brother XiaoChe ... I need to confirm, this girl's Jiang, is not the Jiang of ginger, and the Ying is the Ying of firefly<sup>1</sup>? Also, she has a short head of hair, has a kind of literary girl's breath, looks very quiet. And, and I also ... somewhat like?" Sun Rong asked tentatively.</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(Jiang Ying is "江莹英")</dfn>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>Jiang Xiaoche looked at Sun Rong in surprise: "I also know. She is a student of Jian Shen College."</p>

<p>"It used to be. But maybe not now..." Sun Rong couldn't laugh or cry: "This girl Yingying has now transferred to our school. She even came to the school to register her student status information this morning."</p>

<p>"What a coincidence?" Jiang Xiaoche couldn't believe it: "And Jian Shen College is very good. Why would you want to transfer to Number 60 High School?"</p>

<p>"I guess. She probably likes classmate Wang Ling." Sun Rong replied.</p><p>"..."</p>



<p>Jiang Xiaoche felt that his mentality was completely broken.</p>

<p>How can it be repaired!</p>

<p>Why is it like this again? Dead fish eyes!</p></div>
