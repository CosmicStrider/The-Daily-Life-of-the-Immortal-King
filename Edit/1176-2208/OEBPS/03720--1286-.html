  <h1>Chapter 1286 Does the donor have many question marks?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything is as the monk expected. Cultivators in the divine realm have always been pampered and occupy high positions.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, I have become a bit unmotivated.</p>

    <p>If this continues, it won't be long before cultivators in the divine realm will inevitably become frogs in the well and bring about their own destruction.</p>

    <p>The easiest way to deal with such a group of people is to make them recognize the reality.</p>

    <p>When the monk opened his swastika, the huge meeting hall of Daoxuan Hall was immediately shrouded in Buddha's light!</p>

    <p>This is no ordinary Buddha's light. When it falls on people, the elders in these fields can clearly feel the pressure on their shoulders.</p>

    <p>Some people even bent their knees and fell to their knees on the spot, almost unable to withstand the Buddha's light summoned by the swastika.</p>

    <p>The monk from this earth is more powerful than anyone else in the God Realm. It makes many clan elders and newbies fear him.</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space, several clan elders in the field communicate with each other.</p>

    <p>This is unscientific!</p>

    <p>They clearly remember that the current strongest person on Earth is Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, there is only one True Venerated Immortal level cultivator.</p>

    <p>And whether it is Venerated Immortal or True Venerated Immortal. There is only one.</p>

    <p>And. That True Venerated Immortal was accidentally promoted by eating broccoli...</p>

    <p>God's Domain has been monitoring the situation on Earth, so it didn't take it seriously at all.</p>

    <p>After all, above True Immortal, there is indeed a certain probability of entering such a hidden realm.</p>

    <p>As for the Zhenyuan immortals, this name is not unfamiliar to them. They belong to a relatively primitive group of earth cultivators. They are not too surprised to be promoted to the status of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>So now the question comes. Where did this monk come from?</p>

    <p>"There is no one in the divine realm anymore. The poor monk has never used his full strength."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk faced the elders of the clans in the Divine Realm and showed a kind smile.</p>

    <p>He really didn't use all his strength.</p>

    <p>The power of the Buddha's light summoned by the swastika was less than 10%. Unexpectedly, some of the clan elders in front of them could not withstand the pressure and fell to their knees.</p>

    <p>This made the monk feel very disappointed.</p>

    <p>This boring battle with huge disparity in combat power made him want to yawn.</p>

    <p>However, as an accomplished monk, Jin Deng still strives to maintain the qualities that a high-level cultivator should have.</p>

    <p>Since the fight with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The monk felt that fighting with anyone was boring.</p>

    <p>Although every battle, no matter how big or small, is a process of accumulating experience.</p>

    <p>However, if you ask a level 99 person to fight against a group of 5 scum, even if there is an increase in experience, it will be minimal.</p>

    <p>He would rather waste hundreds more lifetimes of cultivation. Let Wang Ling get slapped a few more times...</p>

    <p>The monk never regretted the showdown with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Wang Ling woke him up. Let him know that his realm is not the strongest yet. There is still room for improvement.</p>

    <p>In fact, what the monk is doing now is also what Wang Ling did to him in the beginning.</p>

    <p>He wants to wake up these narcissistic cultivators of the divine realm.</p>

    <p>"Monk, your realm is so strong. You could have come to the God's Realm a long time ago. What are you doing hiding in a place like Earth where there are so many cultivators?" Zhou Zhentian, the elder of the Zhou family, was also shocked by the aura emanating from the monk.</p>

    <p>In particular, he recognized the "swastika" on the monk's left eye...</p>

    <p>This is the power possessed by the sages of Buddhism!</p>

    <p>"Poor taoist travels all over the world. Where do you want to stay? What does it have to do with you?"</p>

    <p>The monk was speechless.</p>

    <p>He was extremely disappointed with the cultivators of the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>In the spiritual space, Zhou Zhentian, the elder of the Zhou family, communicated crazily with elders of several other clans.</p>

    <p>"I was just wondering why the Wang family, Gu family, and Liu family didn't send anyone over... It turns out there is something fishy going on here!"</p>

    <p>"The descendants of these families have all fled to the earth before. Now that I think about it, I'm afraid there is indeed something inside."</p>

    <p>"Who is this monk?"</p>

    <p>"It's not clear. But it's very strong! There are many people who practice Buddhism, but there are only a handful of people who can derive this swastika. Even in this divine realm, I can only think of a few people."</p>

    <p>During the conversation with several other clan elders, Zhou Zhentian's thoughts changed rapidly.</p>

    <p>He remembered the names of several eminent monks.</p>

    <p>"Tie Ling, Tong Hui, Yin Xian..."</p>

    <p>The grunting sound from Zhou Zhentian's mouth reached the monk's ears.</p>

    <p>"Oh? I didn't expect the Zhou clan elders to have heard of these dharma titles?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng seemed a little surprised when he heard Zhou Zhen Heavenly pronounce these names with his own ears.</p>

    <p>"That's right, monk! It's no big deal that you have a swastika! The three sages of Buddhism in my divine domain also have them!" Zhou Zhentian sneered.</p>

    <p>What's so great about having only one Buddhist sage on this earth?</p>

    <p>They are in the divine domain. But there are three of them!</p>

    <p>However, when he heard Zhou Zhentian's laughter, the monk couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>He looked at Zhou Zhentian and sighed: "The poor monk dare not deceive the Zhou clan elders. To tell the truth, these three Dharma titles given by the Zhou clan clan elders actually belong to the poor monk."</p>

    <p>"This...how is this possible!" Zhou Zhentian was shocked.</p>

    <p>"The swastika requires the power of reincarnation to cultivate." This iron spirit is the name used by the poor monk in 1,000 reincarnations."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Tong Hui. He is from the 1001st and 1999th generations."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Eunhyun was born between 2000 and 2999."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"As for Jin Deng, that is the name that the poor monk uses now."</p>

    <p>The monk explained while performing a Buddhist salute to Zhou Zhentian: "So, the Zhou clan elders said three Dharma names. The three eminent monks are actually all me. Besides, didn't the Zhou clan elders discover that these Dharma names are in gold and silver? The naming of copper and iron originally also has the meaning of reincarnation."</p>

    <p>"The poor monk knows that Elder Zhou and all the elders present have many questions in their minds right now."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed: "But... this is the fact."</p>

    <p>"Monk, don't bully others too much! Don't think that you have the support of the King of the God Realm. We won't beat you!" At this moment, Zhou Zhentian shouted loudly. The elders of the seven major clans in the field could not bear the arrogance of the monk.</p>

    <p>"Take down this arrogant monk!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, the auras of the seven clan elders in the meeting hall were strong!</p>

    <p>Led by Zhou Zhentian, one after another sacrificed their magical weapons. Either swords, knives, axes, or hammers...</p>

    <p>All seven Dao Supremes took action together. The scene was spectacular.</p>

    <p>The monk sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a cultivator from the divine realm.</p>

    <p>It is an anti-world level magical weapon. It is also of the highest grade. It is also unique.</p>

    <p>However, it would be too naive to try to deal with him with such a small trick.</p>

    <p>"Put down the butcher knife."</p>

    <p>The monk's face was like an ancient well. He put his hands together.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the sky, countless golden tentacles appeared out of thin air in the falling Buddha light.</p>

    <p>This is the Buddha's beard. It is summoned by the monk. Say "put down the butcher knife" and you will have the power to disarm!</p>

    <p>The elders of all races actually have no experience fighting against the sage of Buddhism.</p>

    <p>They had just taken out the magic weapon and prepared to take action.</p>

    <p>The magical weapons in his hands were all swept away by these void Buddha beards!</p>

    <p>The speed of these ethereal Buddha beards was incredibly fast. They appeared around them in the blink of an eye, and then took away their magic weapons!</p>

    <p>Then it quickly dissipated and took the magic weapon into the Buddha's light! When they reacted, they couldn't even see the shadow!</p>

    <p>Damn it! Rather than saying "disarm", it's better to say it's an open robbery!</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhenqian's whole body was trembling.</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Supremes were actually humiliated by a monk.</p>

    <p>Where is this face?</p>

    <p>"Everyone, there is something weird about this monk. We can't fight separately. We must gather firepower!" Zhou Zhentian finished speaking. The other clan elders all understood.</p>

    <p>They all put their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. They lined up!</p>

    <p>Use the physical body to transfer spiritual energy layer by layer. Finally, all the power is gathered on Zhou Zhentian who is at the forefront!</p>

    <p>The Ajuan girl who was watching this scene was laughing so hard: "Hey! Monk! Are you trying to catch a chicken?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng, Zhou Zhentian: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>PS: Let's sort out the realms again: Foundation Building, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Itinerant Immortal, True Immortal, True Venerated Immortal, Venerated Immortal, Sage Immortal, Dao Immortal, Dao Supreme, Dao God, Dao Ancestor (after Dao Ancestor) There may be some more. I will add more when I write them), Wang Ling.</p>
