  <h1>Chapter 1912 Seal the Outer God</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"So strong..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was moved, her eyes unconsciously attracted to Wang Ling. Although he now looked like the Great Emperor of the East, the youthfulness in his back view and every move could not be concealed.</p>

    <p>In a blur, she seemed to see the back of Emperor Dongda and the back of Wang Ling overlapping each other.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling's action was magnificent and shocking. It was a true display of divine power. It made everyone in the arena excited.</p>

    <p>The Peng family manager and all the Peng family servants who gathered around him to accept the protection of the Office of Strategic Deception and others were all dumbfounded. They were all stunned. They could almost swallow an ostrich egg in their mouths.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is so fierce. It is simply invincible. The posture of standing on the spot and sweeping all directions is extremely domineering. But the figure that is as solid as a rock and stands motionless shows the color of wind and light.</p>

    <p>This is not the scariest thing.</p>

    <p>Because people who are familiar with Wang Ling know that this is still not Wang Ling's strongest combat power. Because his seal has not been revealed yet. Even if he controls the body of Emperor Dongda with his soul. Wang Ling's power of the soul is maximized at the moment the seal is unveiled.</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Ling still completed the beating of the foreign god in a sealed state.</p>

    <p>And this is still when the Dark Mother Goddess has grown to a mid-to-high-level state. Although she has not completely reached the high-level form, Wang Ling's look of ease has proven that even if the Dark Mother Goddess reaches the high-level form,</p>

    <p>The moment when hundreds of black goats were grabbed by Wang Ling and crushed to pieces with the immortal king's secret power.</p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>The Dark Mother Goddess roared immediately. Its nerves seemed to have been severed, and it roared in agony. Dark purple alien blood gushes out from the damaged parts of its body.</p>

    <p>Although it has strong self-healing ability, it still fell into weakness after enduring long-term abuse from Wang Ling. The self-healing speed was obviously much slower than before.</p>

    <p>This is the effect of the Immortal King's Seal on Wang Ling. Eighty-one forbidden spells are imposed on it at the same time. This directly blocks the possibility of various recovery and resurrection-like forbidden spells.</p>

    <p>However, even in this situation, the Dark Mother Goddess can still heal herself very weakly. This is also something that makes Wang Ling feel a little surprised.</p>

    <p>After all, he has rarely encountered such a durable being.</p>

    <p>But according to Wang Ling's calculation, the hundreds of black goats he just crushed to death were a heavy blow to the Dark Mother Goddess.</p>

    <p>According to its original plan, it was originally intended to delay time by creating these black goats so that it could evolve to a high-level state, and then continuously breed new black goat armies.</p>

    <p>But alas. Its plans fell apart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crushed these black goats to death too quickly. It had only just been summoned. It took only tens of seconds, and not a single one was left.</p>

    <p>In its original judgment, its black goat army would never be that weak. Even summoning two of them would be enough to pester the young man for a while.</p>

    <p>However, it miscalculated. And it will also face the concentrated soul backlash caused by hundreds of black goats exploding to death at the same time.</p>

    <p>Although the Dark Mother Goddess had tried her best to stabilize her body, such concentrated backlash still caused fluctuations in her huge flesh.</p>

    <p>Poof!</p>

    <p>In its body, part of Peng Beicen's body was spit out. Originally, Peng Beicen's whole body was swallowed up. Only a painful and ferocious face was left. The whole person was like a thumbtack deeply embedded in this huge piece of flesh.</p>

    <p>But now, Peng Beicen's upper body has been completely vomited out. This indicates that Sayani Gusi has lost control of Peng Beicen.</p>

    <p>This is a perfect opportunity. Let everyone realize that the next step may be the decisive moment.</p>

    <p>Even at this time, Wang Ling was still so calm. His feet never moved. It was like a strong pine piercing the earth.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>An index finger was raised. It was pointed at Sayani Gusi's body suddenly. With a bang, a shocking sound came. It was like the collision of a bell on the Dao, emitting a dazzling golden light.</p>

    <p>No one could clearly see how Wang Ling's finger guided the outer god. He remained motionless on the spot. From a long distance away, he poked a huge hole in the outer god's body.</p>

    <p>And this is far from over. The aurora at Wang Ling's fingertips carries world-shaking power. Wave after wave of raindrops are as dense as raindrops and are blasted forward. Like divine arrows piercing the sky.</p>

    <p>The foreign god was obviously unable to resist. The huge piece of meat collapsed like meat on the chopping board. Wang Ling used his finger power to accurately segment the outline. As much as possible, Peng Beicen's body was separated as intact as possible.</p>

    <p>"It's done!"</p>

    <p>The moment Peng Beicen completely fell off the huge piece of meat, Jin Deng took action instantly. He swarmed up with the clothes prepared by Sun Rong, Liu Qingyi, and You Yueqing. He was completely unafraid of foreign gods. He caught Peng Beicen who fell off the piece of meat.</p>

    <p>The Outer God has completely collapsed. Therefore, Monk Jin Deng is not afraid of this move. And only the monk who is usually not a womanizer does it himself, so that no one will have any objections.</p>

    <p>What's more, the current monk himself is also playing the role of the empress. This painting looks extremely beautiful from a distance, and there is no sense of dissonance.</p>

    <p>He only waited for the moment when the monk successfully caught Peng Beicen. Wang Ling then nodded secretly and began to prepare for his next move with confidence.</p>

    <p>He jumped up. He was above the void. The impressions of the Immortal King all over his body began to move forward from his body as if they were given life. They gradually gathered in the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's palm moved forward. The huge immortal king's seal turned into a giant net. It directly pressed down from the sky and wrapped all the huge flesh of the Dark Mother Goddess in it.</p>

    <p>This is the "King's Palm" derived from the immortal king's seal. With one palm, all things can be suppressed. Sayani Gusi was already beaten to residual blood and was unable to resist. Now that this palm is used, he will be let go immediately. It's tied up.</p>

    <p>There was absolutely no resistance left. Even the roar was firmly suppressed by Wang Ling in the seal in the palm. When the runes of the immortal king's seal climbed onto Sayani Gusi's body.</p>

    <p>The runes on it immediately began to shrink from all directions, compressing the black piece of flesh infinitely. The body of the Dark Mother Goddess was like a piece of cooked pork filled with water. In the end, only a small block remained.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine that such a powerful alien god could be sealed like that.</p>

    <p>And seeing Peng Beicen being rescued, and the Outer God being completely sealed, Peng Xiren, who had been hiding in the darkroom, finally couldn't hold it any longer. He was trembling with anger, and was about to rush out.</p>

    <p>What he didn't expect was that Wang Ling had already noticed him.</p>

    <p>Before he could move, the land above his secret room was completely lifted open by the young man's wave...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling stood on the edge with his hands behind his back, staring down at him.</p>
