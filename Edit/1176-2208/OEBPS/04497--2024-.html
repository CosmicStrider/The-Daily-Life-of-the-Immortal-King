  <h1>Chapter 2024 Identification of popular spiritual beasts on the Internet</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Liang?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya frowned. Then he showed a look of realization: "So you are the famous science popularizer Dr. Xiao!"</p>

    <p>"Dr. Xiao?" Sun Rong and Wang Ling were confused at the same time.</p>

    <p>"His self-media account is called Infinite Xiaoliang." Immortal Toya replied.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be Teacher Xiaoliang..." Sun Rong was also surprised. It turns out that she herself is also a fan of Dr. Xiao.</p>

    <p>The series of videos on identifying popular spiritual beasts on the Internet have been viewed more than tens of billions on major self-media platforms. He is a very popular self-media author!</p>

    <p>In addition, he has the support of a high degree of education. In recent years, the name "Infinite Xiaoliang" has almost become a phenomenon in the cultivation science circle.</p>

    <p>It even directly led to the fact that no one could remember the real name of Dr. Xiao. Instead, they kept calling him Teacher Xiaoliang or Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>"But Teacher Xiaoliang. I remember when you were live broadcasting, you were still in human form?" Sun Rong was confused.</p>

    <p>Although this teacher Xiaoliang's human form looks somewhat similar to a Tibetan fox... But overall, the unsmiling explanation style is still very interesting.</p>

    <p>"After all, the live broadcast time is not long. You can still maintain it for a period of time by consuming spiritual energy and using the shape-shifting technique to transform into a human form. But it can only last for an hour to two hours at most. So I usually go offline after 50 minutes of live broadcast." Mr. Fox sighed and said helplessly.</p>

    <p>"But this should be your secret. Tell us are you okay..." Sun Rong asked politely.</p>

    <p>"You should call me Mr. Zanghu. No need to use honorifics. Although you didn't recognize me, I recognize you. You are the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group."</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu said: "In my latest video update, I just talked about the tasteless coral. I also mentioned the issue of the Sun family's sacrificial island hundreds of years ago. Of course, I also recognize Miss Sun. Classmate Sun is both good in character and learning. Your character is guaranteed. Of course I believe you will not tell anyone. As for the two people next to you, I recognize Immortal Toya-senpai..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he turned his gaze to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only gave Immortal Toya a look. Immortal Toya immediately understood. He scratched his head and said with a smile, "Don't worry, Mr. Zanghu. This classmate Wang. is my disciple."</p>

    <p>"Eh? When did you accept a disciple? Why haven't I heard of it?"</p>

    <p>"I collected it secretly." Immortal Toya said with a smile: "This counts as me exchanging secrets with Mr. Zanghu. Isn't it?"</p>

    <p>"It makes sense. This way we can even out the situation."</p>

    <p>Zanghu nodded. Then he looked at Wang Ling: "So this classmate Wang. is also a fan of mine?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fell silent.</p>

    <p>He actually doesn't pay much attention to news about cultivation and popular science...</p>

    <p>After all, he wants to check something. Just ask Heavenly Dao directly.</p>

    <p>No matter how sophisticated the science of cultivation is in this world, it is not as accurate as asking Heavenly Dao directly.</p>

    <p>After all, the operating rules of everything in today's world of cultivation are actually derived from Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>All creatures, spells and other things related to cultivation are just branches, branches, fruits and leaves derived from Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling, there was no reply. The situation became awkward for a while. Zanghu actually didn't expect that there would be high school students these days who were not fans of him. He didn't watch his videos.</p>

    <p>"Don't be surprised, Mr. Zanghu. My disciple is usually like this. He doesn't have much contact with the Internet. He is a person who is obsessed with spiritual practice." Immortal Toya saw this and quickly bowed to smooth things over.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the expression on Zanghu's face instantly relaxed a lot: "So that's it. That's very rare! Today's young people are always scrolling around with their mobile phones. They can really isolate themselves from the Internet and calm down. There are indeed very few people coming."</p>

    <p>"Let's not talk about this anymore. Mr. Zanghu."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled and said: "I want to ask Mr. Zanghu. Since Mr. Zanghu came here for the prehistoric spirit whale, is there anything to gain? I am not satisfied with what Mr. Zanghu said. We also came here for this spirit whale. Come.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. What a great relationship! Exploring the secrets together will give you a greater sense of accomplishment! Information sharing!"</p>

    <p>Zanghu said: "And you may not believe it when I tell you. I really saw that guy! But that guy was very fierce. He just pulled my boat apart with his tail... so I was floating on the sea like that."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he stared at the submarine at his feet. The light in his pupils flickered: "Now that we have this submarine, I think it shouldn't be difficult to find that guy!"</p>

    <p>"Does Mr. Zanghu have this confidence?"</p>

    <p>"That's natural. I know the habits of spiritual whales very well." Mr. Zanghu said confidently. He is afraid of sea water. But now that he has this submarine, his path to find this prehistoric spiritual whale has become much more steadfast. point.</p>

    <p>Looking at the huge "black fish" under his feet, Tibetan Fox squatted down and touched it. He couldn't help but praise: "As expected of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. This is the sixth generation of cultivation submarines. Not only is the internal system completely made in Huaxiu." Even the chips are all independently developed and created by our country."</p>

    <p>As a popular science scholar, I can only say that Mr. Zanghu is worthy of being Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Not only does he have a lot of research on spiritual beasts, but he also dabbles in more or less knowledge about the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>"Then Mr. Zanghu knows how many generations the latest one is now?"</p>

    <p>"This is not convenient to disclose. You have to know that the technology that can be used for commercial sales is the latest on the market. But in fact... it is not necessarily the latest. It is usually sold for one generation. Hide one generation and then study the next generation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After entering the submarine's operating space, he was faced with a dazzling array of instrument panels. Mr. Zanghu was also very familiar with it.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zanghu can also drive a submarine?"</p>

    <p>"No. But in fact, the sixth-generation submarine is not difficult to control. Because the system and chips are the latest. Just use artificial intelligence mode to control it."</p>

    <p>He first turned on the power. Then he placed his palm directly on the induction control screen: "Look, now I just need to put my hand on this control screen. I can directly let the control screen read my brain thoughts, thus allowing the submarine to operate. Get moving."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a string of system red text warnings appeared on the electronic glass screen in front of him.</p>

    <p>[Alert! Smart sensor operating system read failed!]</p>

    <p>[Do not place your pet's palm on the sensor screen!]</p>

    <p>For a moment, everyone in the submarine fell into silence.</p>

    <p>"I'll do it. Senior Tibetan Fox..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Okay..." Although he didn't say it, it could be seen that Mr. Zanghu was a little desperate at this time.</p>

    <p>When the submarine successfully entered the intelligent driving mode under the thinking consciousness of Sun Rong, Zanghu suddenly noticed a key question: "By the way, Classmate Sun, does this submarine have enough energy reserve? I think the current The remaining energy can only last for two hours at most."</p>

    <p>"It's okay, senior. We have plenty of energy."</p>

    <p>"Have you brought enough spirit stones?" Zanghu said, "I suggest you go to the energy furnace now to replenish the spirit stones to avoid the problem of insufficient battery life."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard this. He silently pulled out a piece of his hair and handed it to Immortal Toya...</p>
