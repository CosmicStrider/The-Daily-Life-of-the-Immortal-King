  <h1>Chapter 1496 How scary is a jealous girl?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling Almost all the ID photos have a dead look. They always have the kind of expression that is hopeless and never wakes up. It lacks the temperament of a sunny boy. This may be difficult for Wang Ling The problem with change.</p>

    <p>This directly led to Wang Ling being labeled a "melancholic boy" from childhood to adulthood. It was different from the sense of abstinence... I don't know if it was because of the dead fish eyes. It directly caused this Wang Ling looks a bit "virtual."</p>

    <p>When I was in junior high school, Wang Ling remembered that I was given a very excessive nickname. It was called: Mr. Kidney Deficiency...</p>

    <p>He didn't know where this nickname Wang Ling came from.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling is too lazy to pay attention to this kind of childish behavior.</p>

    <p>In essence, giving people nicknames in school is actually an act of violence.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, the nickname incident in junior high school did not last long.</p>

    <p>At that time, many people really felt that Wang Ling was weak and deliberately ran over to find trouble and bully Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For example, when Wang Ling was going to the toilet, he came out of the single room at the back and slapped Wang Ling violently...</p>

    <p>It's okay if I don't shoot him down. After the shooting, all the bullies in the junior high school and senior high school were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>This guy...can he really be called Mr. Kidney Deficiency?</p>

    <p>Let me ask you which family with kidney deficiency can grow a cracked empty seat...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It took about ten minutes. The female police officer finally gave up her resistance completely like the previous photographers who were keen on taking ID photos with smiling faces.</p>

    <p>Such a good-looking young man is actually an autistic boy... What a pity!</p>

    <p>She stared at Wang Ling's ID photo with facial paralysis and sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>In fact, not all police officers who take ID photos have such patience.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it was because he had a lot of free time today, and on the other hand, it was also because Wang Ling actually liked the female police officer.</p>

    <p>Overflowing motherhood may be a common problem among women. I saw Wang Ling. The female police officer felt as if she was seeing her own son. The two of them are also about the same age.</p>

    <p>"I think the photo was taken very well!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was very happy beside him. On the contrary, he thought Wang Ling was quite cute like this.</p>

    <p>"fine?"</p>

    <p>The female police officer chuckled.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...</p>

    <p>The next person to take ID photos is Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong had a passport a long time ago.</p>

    <p>This time, in addition to taking the latest passport photo, I also applied for an extension.</p>

    <p>"It's really troublesome, police officer sister." Facing the camera, the girl behaved very generously and naturally, with a smile that was not stiff, just like those celebrity models who are used to taking pictures.</p>

    <p>The photo taken with this ID card is smooth and smooth. It is much smoother than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The girl's skin was so good that the female police officer was envious. It was obvious that the picture was not retouched. It was as if a beauty filter had been turned on.</p>

    <p>While helping Sun Rong make a new passport, the female police officer took a look at Sun Rong's old photo.</p>

    <p>Then, I was surprised by the dazzling array of stamps from various countries on the passport: "Wow. Have you been to so many places?"</p>

    <p>After all, she is the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. The world she has seen is indeed Guangzhou...</p>

    <p>The female police officer felt another wave of emotion in her heart.</p>

    <p>Money. It really limits people's imagination to a great extent...</p>

    <p>What is the life of a rich person like? Perhaps most people will not be able to experience it in this life.</p>

    <p>In the process. Wang Ling saw the photo on Sun Rong's old passport.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong on this passport. She is still a cute little girl.</p>

    <p>"Did you have a passport when you were in elementary school..." Wang Ling was startled.</p>

    <p>No wonder Sun Rong came here specially to replace the photo today. The changes between elementary school and high school are quite significant.</p>

    <p>And I don't know why. Wang Ling stared at the photo of Sun Rong as a primary school student. I felt a sense of familiarity in my mind.</p>

    <p>It seemed like a long time ago. He and Sun Rong had met accidentally...</p>

    <p>But that memory has become blurry.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Judgment. Maybe it was an accidental encounter.</p>

    <p>As a result, he and Sun Rong had nothing to do with each other.</p>

    <p>By the time everything was ready, it was almost evening before I knew it.</p>

    <p>Boarding time is on Tuesday, December 15th. That is eight o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>As soon as he went out, he saw Zhuo Yi driving his car and waiting at the door with an obedient expression.</p>

    <p>This is Zhuo Yi's personal car. And it's already a relatively low-key one.</p>

    <p>Today Zhuo Yi actually ran around with Wang Ling and Sun Rong all day long and went through various procedures.</p>

    <p>The passport is the last step.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that passport issuance is not that fast. However, the official intervention from Zhuo Yi is the green channel.</p>

    <p>This includes visas as well.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi here, Number 60 High School here, and Jiugong's house on Sun Island. We said hello to each other. There will be no obstacles to getting a visa.</p>

    <p>It can be said that everything is ready now. All we need is the east wind.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling and Sun Rong approached the car, through the car window, Wang Ling suddenly spotted the dapper looking Jiugong Liangzi sitting in the passenger seat.</p>

    <p>The girl put on the familiar gothic-style dark dress. She crossed her arms and frowned. She didn't know what she was thinking about.</p>

    <p>"Come. Disciple, get in the car quickly!" Zhuo Yi smiled and greeted Wang Ling warmly.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently.</p>

    <p>Not even angry.</p>

    <p>Anyway, right now, it's all just acting...</p>

    <p>A good person always does his best. Zhuo Yi helped him take so many blames. Being called disciple Wang Ling felt that it was not really a loss.</p>

    <p>And he also hopes that Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi can really become successful.</p>

    <p>This girl Jiugong is difficult to deal with. If she becomes an enemy, it will be very troublesome.</p>

    <p>Opening the car door. Wang Ling stood aside obediently. Very politely, he asked Sun Rong to take his seat first.</p>

    <p>Then, he went up from the other side.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Wang Ling through the rearview mirror. He seemed to be slightly dissatisfied with this "apprentice": "You, an apprentice, are so rude? You met the master and didn't even say hello?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel. Hearing Jiugong Liangzi's questioning voice, his feet suddenly shook. He suddenly stepped on the brakes in the middle of driving. Jiugong Liangzi's head knocked forward on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Hey." Jiugong Liangzi was hit. Because he was wearing a seat belt, it didn't hurt much. He was just a little frightened: "Can you do it... If not, let me drive!"</p>

    <p>She felt aggrieved.</p>

    <p>Whenever this happens, Jiugong Liangzi thinks of his unsatisfactory plain.</p>

    <p>If it were big enough, it would be two airbags! It would be a good buffer!</p>

    <p>"Are you here to drive? Are you an adult?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiHehehehe. This sounds like a casual saying, but in fact it contains a hidden secret.</p>

    <p>Behind the scenes. Wang Ling, Sun Rong were actually faintly heard.</p>

    <p>They all know what Jiugong Liangzi's secret is.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't mean to say that. I just felt that Jiugong Liangzi was a little hostile to Wang Ling. So he followed the words and said something that made Jiugong Liangzi care.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, after these words were finished, the girl in the passenger seat became much more at ease.</p>

    <p>He just turned his face away and looked out the window. On the surface, he looked like he was sulking.</p>

    <p>In fact, I am also struggling in my heart whether my secret has been discovered by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"But what I just said was probably unintentional..." Jiugong Liangzi comforted himself on the way.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Schoolmates, you will leave early tomorrow morning. Let me treat you tonight. What do you want to eat?" Seeing that the atmosphere was awkward, Zhuo Yi asked after being immersed in the car for tens of seconds. road.</p>

    <p>"Both Wang Ling and I are fine." Sun Rong replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>She knows. Wang Ling is not too picky about food. There is no need to worry about food taboos.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling's physique is really difficult to gain weight. Even if the fat is eaten, it can be rubbed off...</p>

    <p>"Okay. I know a good barbecue restaurant." Zhuo Yi nodded. Then he turned to look at the girl beside him who was still sulking: "Where is Jiugong? Can you accept it?"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to eat barbecue...will get fat..." Jiugong Liangzi murmured.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong is so thin and still afraid of getting fat? I think it's okay for girls to be fat. Just let the fat go where it should go." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's eyes suddenly lit up when he heard these words. Then he quickly returned to calm.</p>

    <p>The girl snorted and turned her head towards the window: "As you wish..."</p>

    <p>Atmosphere. It should have been saved...</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene. Zhuo Yi also breathed a sigh of relief. He couldn't help but lament his own difficulties.</p>

    <p>The master and his wife are in the back seat. My future wife is beside me.</p>

    <p>This pressure is indeed great...</p>

    <p>After all, he and Jiugong will really be together in the future.</p>

    <p>In front of him, apart from the merciless father-in-law, there were six mothers-in-law...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The four of them arrived at the barbecue restaurant successfully.</p>

    <p>In public places. Zhuo Yi doesn't want to reveal his identity, so he wears sunglasses and a cap that keeps his hair down.</p>

    <p>The funny costume made Jiugong Liangzi feel funny.</p>

    <p>After sitting down, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly realized a problem: "Eh? That classmate Wang Xiaoer and senior Jin Deng... aren't they coming?"</p>

    <p>"They will meet at Songhai City International Boatyard tomorrow morning. Don't worry about them." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>In fact, the main reason is that the approval procedures for Wang Ming to go abroad are more troublesome.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi has tried its best to coordinate, whether Wang Ming can go abroad in the end depends on the agreement between the old secretary and President Qi.</p>

    <p>After all, the job that Wang Ming went out for this time was nominally "investigating aliens." And this job was possible even without Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>There are so many experts and scholars who study aliens in the Magic Weapon Academy of Sciences. It really doesn't matter who they send.</p>

    <p>The authorities are still worried about what to do if Wang Ming's true identity is leaked and he is abroad and is forcibly detained for a reason.</p>

    <p>Although the probability of this is relatively small, it is still a potential risk and needs to be evaluated.</p>

    <p>As for this matter, Wang Ling himself is quite calm.</p>

    <p>There is "big luck." I think Wang Ming will pass the trial. There will be no trouble.</p>

    <p>During the ordering process, a graceful waitress came from a distance carrying a tray. She placed the ice lemonade on the tray in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"My name is Aya. This is the complimentary ice lemonade. If necessary, you can call me for a refill at any time."</p>

    <p>The waitress named "Aya" smiled.</p>

    <p>Immediately, she looked at Zhuo Yi: "This gentleman, you seem to look familiar?"</p>

    <p>"Really..." Zhuo Yi pushed up his sunglasses and smiled awkwardly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi glanced at Jiugong Liangzi indifferently. He found that there were dense thorns in the girl's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. Are you Mr. Zhuo Yi..."</p>

    <p>In fact, when she saw the loose curls on Zhuo Yi's forehead, the waitress had already confirmed Zhuo Yi's identity.</p>

    <p>As if on purpose, Aya lowered her upper body very low. Zhuo Yi Wearing sunglasses, you can see the two dazzling lumps of flesh on the waitress' chest that look like white noodles.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi found this barbecue restaurant. It is considered a place he often comes to.</p>

    <p>Although he usually covers it up, most of the waiters in the store know it's him. Under normal circumstances, people won't make such a fuss.</p>

    <p>This Aya is obviously new here. For a moment, Zhuo Yi felt helpless.</p>

    <p>Now that he has been recognized, of course he can only admit it.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi took off his sunglasses. Then he made a silencing gesture towards Aya: "You are right. But I hope you can keep your voice down..."</p>

    <p>"I understand!" The waitress looked excited.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Jiugong Liangzi realized that he seemed to have underestimated the popularity of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Go to public places and be recognized by others even though you are disguised. You really look like a celebrity!</p>

    <p>And usually those who can be recognized are mostly "true fans" who have continued to pay attention...</p>

    <p>This Aya was not polite at all. She took out her phone on the spot, switched it to selfie mode, and then adjusted the beauty level to the highest level.</p>

    <p>"Um... Mr. Zhuo Yi, can I take a photo with you?" She was obedient. She didn't disturb the other diners. She kept her voice very low. There was a little numbness in her shyness. Then he pretended to pull up the collar of his uniform.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This scene made Wang Ling immediately turn his face away with an obedient expression.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was watching this scene as if watching a play. At the same time, he was satisfied with Wang Ling's "don't look at anything inappropriate" behavior.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling didn't know why he turned his face away.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was the instinctive reaction of a straight man. He felt that he should turn around...</p>

    <p>"Sorry. It's not convenient for me to take a group photo." Zhuo Yi smiled at the waitress and refused.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had never refused such a thing before.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the coalition election is coming soon. He needs to pay extra attention.</p>

    <p>After all, Zhuo Yi is still well-known across the country. Taking a group photo is nothing in itself. But I am afraid that people with ulterior motives will use the group photo to do bad things.</p>

    <p>For example, more than a year ago, a photo of Zhuo Yi was used by a restaurant owner for promotion. He said Zhuo Yi was his relative... to attract business.</p>

    <p>After that incident, Zhuo Yi actually became more cautious and rarely took photos with others.</p>

    <p>"No way..." The request was rejected. The waitress named "Aya" looked disappointed.</p>

    <p>She gently rubbed Zhuo Yi's legs with her feet.</p>

    <p>"If you don't mind, I can sign instead."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi raised the corner of his lower lip slightly. He actually knew what the hell this Aya was thinking.</p>

    <p>However. Withstand the temptation.</p>

    <p>This itself is also a test for cadres.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi considers himself a person with strong self-control.</p>

    <p>It's not like he hasn't experienced scenes like this before.</p>

    <p>And it's actually very easy to get rid of this waitress.</p>

    <p>But his focus is not here.</p>

    <p>He was more curious. Jiugong's attitude and reaction.</p>

    <p>In fact, at this time, Jiugong Liangzi's face was already very ugly.</p>

    <p>The girl's face is clouded. Combined with the dark gothic dress, she looks like a witch in an old castle.</p>

    <p>Even if he didn't say anything, Sun Rong could still feel that Jiugong Liangzi wanted to eat the waitress alive.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo Yi. I have always been your fan. Please...just one picture! Okay? I promise not to spread it!"</p>

    <p>But the waitress seemed to be obsessed with Zhuo Yi. She made a arrogant and squeamish voice. She didn't take Jiugong Liangzi seriously at all.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi actually couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>He was about to respond to this matter with a serious attitude.</p>

    <p>As a result, what Zhuo Yi didn't expect at this time was that Jiugong Liangzi couldn't help it anymore.</p>

    <p>The girl's back was straight. She was clearly sitting. But there was a condescending air about her: "Mr. Zhuo said, it's not convenient for us to take a photo. Isn't it fun for you?"</p>

    <p>"I just want to take a group photo. Can't you? No matter how lenient it is..." After being questioned, Aya showed an aggrieved expression.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi sat upright with a look of contempt on his face: "We are here to eat. If this lady wants to show off her charm, she can go elsewhere. After all, there are dirty things when eating, which will affect appetite."</p>

    <p>This is too straightforward to say.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong secretly called it wonderful.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling always fixed his gaze at the previous "look no evil" position.</p>

    <p>There is only one kind of war in this world. Wang Ling may never be able to participate.</p>

    <p>That is. The war between women...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Jiugong Liangzi's aura seemed to be magnified instantly.</p>

    <p>It's clearly only at the level of Foundation Building. But it's as bold as Soul Formation!</p>

    <p>"What do you mean..." Aya seemed to have been poked into some pain point. The expression on her face also looked very ugly.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't mean anything. It just means that you should change places and clean up the dirty things." Jiugong Liangzi faked a smile and glanced at the waitress' lower body pretending to be light.</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The waitress felt that something was not right with her situation.</p>

    <p>Because at this time, she actually got her period!</p>

    <p>The situation was reversed. Aya fled in a hurry with her legs crossed.</p>

    <p>"That's it?" Jiugong Liangzi snorted as he looked at the waitress leaving in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi...what did you do?" Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>"Nothing."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi shook his head and said.</p>

    <p>She was too lazy to continue arguing with the wind in front of her, because doing so would only attract more attention.</p>

    <p>So luckily, she used the power of the replica {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>Because the cause of the riots has not yet been revealed, Jiugong Liangzi knew that there were certain risks in doing so.</p>

    <p>But she just couldn't hold it back...</p>

    <p>So, I summoned a little ghost named "Excavator" and did some tricks.</p>

    <p>This little thing won't be fatal. It just bleeds a little as a warning. It's like the arrival of an aunt.</p>

    <p>"Excavator..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't mean to read minds. I just happened to hear it.</p>

    <p>He suddenly shed a cold sweat. He once again felt the terror of girls...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because Aya went to take care of her personal hygiene issues, a male waiter was replaced in the store to serve their table.</p>

    <p>You don't need to do it yourself. The waiters are professionally trained. They know exactly how long it takes to roast different parts of the meat.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt relieved when he saw that the waiter was a male waiter named "Xiaoguang."</p>

    <p>She didn't regret what she had just done.</p>

    <p>If that Aya hadn't left, she was grilling meat and showing off to Zhuo Yi in front of her. Jiugong Liangzi felt a little nauseous just thinking about it.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the male waiters are much better.</p>

    <p>The waiter just immersed himself in the barbecue. Then he distributed the roasted meat equally to everyone's plates. He remained quiet the whole time.</p>

    <p>There is no harm if there is no foil. Jiugong Liangzi was so satisfied with the waiter that he even wanted to pay for the tip himself.</p>

    <p>While chatting and laughing with Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly noticed that the waiter was grilling an oxtail.</p>

    <p>His movements are extremely skillful. I don't know how many times he has been roasted before he becomes so skilled.</p>

    <p>After being coated with special sauce, this oxtail was roasted to a fragrant aroma.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blinked his eyes. He was looking forward to the waiter grilling the oxtail and cutting it into pieces.</p>

    <p>As a result, the male waiter directly picked up a whole oxtail and put it directly on Zhuo Yi's dinner plate: "Mr. Zhuo, try this. This is our store's signature grilled oxtail. It is a special gift."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is puzzled: "As a gift?"</p>

    <p>The waiter named "Xiaoguang" blushed: "Actually... I am also a fan of Mr. Zhuo. I have been following Mr. Zhuo for a long time... I have always liked you very much..."</p>

    <p>The waiter rubbed his head and smiled stupidly.</p>

    <p>Is this...a confession?</p>

    <p>Or. By a boy?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so scared that he dropped his chopsticks...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, don't move... I'll help you pick it up..." Sun Rong was also very frightened.</p>

    <p>When she bent down to pick up the chopsticks for Wang Ling, she found Jiugong Liangzi skillfully flipping through the replica {Ghost Book} under the table.</p>

    <p>I immediately had a premonition of what would happen to this male waiter.</p>

    <p>As expected...</p>

    <p>The male waiter named Xiaoguang quickly ran to deal with his own personal problems.</p>

    <p>"Men are also okay?" Sun Rong was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>"They're all the same. One aunt and one uncle." Jiugong Liangzi said calmly.</p>

    <p>She secretly cursed Zhuo Yi in her heart for finding this shabby store...it's really full of all kinds of monsters!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>And then. There is no more.</p>

    <p>After experiencing "Aya" and "Xiao Guang", Jiugong Liangzi began to be extremely wary of the waiters who approached their table intentionally. Everyone looked like they were here to express their feelings.</p>

    <p>Anyone who approaches their table and looks at Zhuo Yi for more than ten seconds will be sent to Jiugong Liangzi to deal with personal issues...</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was not in the mood to eat. His eyes were looking around like searchlights.</p>

    <p>She thought that no waiter would dare to come over. But at this time, she saw a smiling old man walking towards them in the distance.</p>

    <p>The girl looked at Zhuo Yi in astonishment.</p>

    <p>I never thought that Zhuo Yi could even attract an old man...</p>

    <p>Smiling is not a good thing...</p>

    <p>That's all. Let's send it off together!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi, wait!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi, who had seen through the little girl's little moves, suddenly stopped her.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "This person is the store manager. I have known him before..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "No way...but I already..."</p>

    <p>When they said this, the old store manager had already walked towards them: "I'm sorry, Mr. Zhuo. I don't know what's going on in my store. It seems that everyone has some problems today."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Zhuo Yi, Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>"The new Aya in our store and Xiao Guang, who came to wait at your place before, are actually boyfriend and girlfriend."..."</p>

    <p>"I knew you were coming, so I arranged for this young couple who are both your fans to wait on you. I didn't expect that today's young people are all frail and sick."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, the store manager's expression suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had an ominous premonition: "What's wrong?"</p>

    <p>Store manager: "Sorry...I have to go too. To deal with some personal issues..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
