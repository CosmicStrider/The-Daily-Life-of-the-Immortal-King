  <h1>Chapter 1465 Youth without games is not youth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After ruling out all possibilities, Sun Rong still feels that Mr. Boss Sun is more suspicious.</p>

    <p>However, this trip to the ancient streets. It is true that she did not inform her grandfather in advance...</p>

    <p>In other words, it is very possible that grandpa already knows about this matter. And it is very likely that he has arranged for someone to protect him on the ancient street?</p>

    <p>However, when I was walking along the ancient street, Sun Rong did not find any other suspicious people.</p>

    <p>So according to grandpa's temper, there is a high probability that he will replace the staff of the ancient street with his own...</p>

    <p>To be honest. Sun Rong's mood at this time is quite complicated.</p>

    <p>Of course she knew that this was Boss Sun's love for her.</p>

    <p>My grandpa has always done the same thing since I was little.</p>

    <p>However, no matter how tough the wings are, they cannot protect the chicks for a lifetime.</p>

    <p>She has grown up. The feeling of being followed by bodyguards all the time is actually not uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>No matter what you do, it feels like there are millions of eyes staring at you.</p>

    <p>It's better to wait until this matter is over and then go talk to grandpa.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought.</p>

    <p>She didn't let this little episode ruin her mood.</p>

    <p>After all, this is also grandpa's feelings for her.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong's intuition was quickly verified.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he saw the girl hesitating in front of the store. The employee of this cold weapon store suddenly smiled at Sun Rong and said, "Miss Sun, won't you go in?"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>She obviously never revealed her name.</p>

    <p>How did this little brother know her surname was Sun?</p>

    <p>He is obviously from the Huaguo Shuilian Group!</p>

    <p>However, the simple shop boy did not realize that he had leaked something.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't see through it either. She pretended not to know anything and walked into the store.</p>

    <p>In the cold weapon shop. In front of the huge Stone Spear throwing field. Chen Chao's throwing results have been released.</p>

    <p>He firmly believed that he could win the first place.</p>

    <p>As a result, when I was throwing it, I realized that the Stone Spear was still too heavy.</p>

    <p>His explosive power was not fully used at all.</p>

    <p>The final score was 96 meters.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations on winning the encouragement award." A female staff member handed over the ticket with a smile.</p>

    <p>Beside. Wang Ling looked at Chen Chao with envy.</p>

    <p>It was his turn next.</p>

    <p>"Very heavy Wang Ling. Be careful."</p>

    <p>Then. Chen Chao handed the new Stone Spear placed on the shelf next to Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>Feather weight.</p>

    <p>So is it really heavy?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't feel it at all.</p>

    <p>His throw, even if it was a water drop, was thrown lightly, it would probably be at least the distance from the earth to the sun.</p>

    <p>The situation is not good.</p>

    <p>We still have to think of a way.</p>

    <p>He holds a spear in his hand and assumes a very standard throwing posture.</p>

    <p>He pulled his right arm back. The amplitude was very large. A draft swept through the room, causing the white shirt on Wang Ling's upper body to be lifted up, revealing his beautiful figure curves and contours.</p>

    <p>The looming abdominal muscles and the perfect mermaid line.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw this scene just after entering the door. His cheeks suddenly felt hot.</p>

    <p>In fact, this was also within Mother Wang's calculation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has actually gained a bit of weight recently. There is a lot of fat on my belly.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has a {Great Weight Loss Technique}. It's no problem to just lift some meat manually.</p>

    <p>So before going out, Mother Wang asked Wang Ling to show off her eight-pack abs. She also showed him a photo of {{Dragon Ball}: "Yes! Super Saiyan! Just face this direction." Just develop!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks eight-pack abs are too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>The last plan I came up with was just to get rid of my fat.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling knows, this actually attracts more attention.</p>

    <p>Even Li Youyue was amazed when she saw it. She couldn't help but hit Sun Rong with her elbow: "Tsk. This figure is simply amazing... Why can a boy have such a good figure..."</p>

    <p>She thinks that any girl would envy her.</p>

    <p>Because in fact. Sometimes reality is just that real.</p>

    <p>Some boys' legs may be thinner than girls' legs. It's entirely possible that this is true.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Wang Ling is not too tall now.</p>

    <p>After all, a 16-year-old boy has not fully grown up yet. If he grows taller, according to Li Youyue's judgment, Wang Ling will definitely be a chopstick master in the future.</p>

    <p>"Hey. What a pity. The famous grass has an owner."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was envious. She envied Wang Ling. She also envied Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushes: "Don't talk nonsense..."</p>

    <p>"Come on. You are the only one who has the patience for such a piece of wood. If it were me, it would be fine if you gave me a year or two. If I don't get a response, it would be difficult for me to persist." Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>Finally, the topic returned to the key word "wood."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked helpless and showed a bitter smile: "How long do you think I have to wait?"</p>

    <p>"Go buy this book and read it for reference." Li Youyue replied.</p>

    <p>"Which book?"Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"{On Protracted War}"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Li Youyue said, perhaps this youthful unrequited love must be transformed into a long-distance love race. It really requires a huge investment of time and energy.</p>

    <p>For Sun Rong, this is a game. A game with "Wang Ling wood."</p>

    <p>The girl raised her eyes and looked at the boy in front of her...</p>

    <p>Obviously, the boy is also playing a game. He is playing a game with the Stone Spear in his hand.</p>

    <p>At the same time, just a block away from the cold weapon store, Zhuo Yi was also secretly playing a game with Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, as long as you give it a try, your bicycle will become a motorcycle.</p>

    <p>Youth without "games" is not called youth</p>

    <p>Sometimes young people should be bolder.</p>

    <p>Originally. Zhuo Yi wanted to tease Jiugong Liangzi again. Then observe the girl's cute reaction.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that the situation is not allowed.</p>

    <p>Because he received a reminder message from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although those Jiugong family members whose origins are unknown, I don't know what their purpose is.</p>

    <p>But since it was a tip given by his master Wang Ling. Zhuo Yi felt that he probably couldn't add it.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is very likely to encounter some danger.</p>

    <p>After turning around the entrance of the alley in front of the ancient street, Zhuo Yi quickly hid his figure.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, a girl wearing a black cloak followed him closely.</p>

    <p>Just waiting for the moment Jiugong Liangzi entered the alley, Zhuo Yi quickly took action. He picked up Jiugong Liangzi and pushed him against a wall. He covered Jiugong Liangzi's mouth with his hand.</p>

    <p>The girl never expected that she would be discovered after following her all the way!</p>

    <p>I immediately wanted to exclaim. But I saw Zhuo Yi making a "silence" gesture with a serious face. Then he gradually let go of her.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Sorry. The situation was urgent. I had to do this as a last resort. I offended classmate Jiugong."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do..." Jiugong Liangzi looked disgusted.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong is going out today. Are you alone?" Zhuo Yi asked softly.</p>

    <p>"None of your business. Why should I tell you?" Jiugong Liangzi snorted arrogantly.</p>

    <p>Now she just wants to find a place to wash her face, because her mouth has been touched by this liar's hand!</p>

    <p>"Because there are people from the Jiugong family right behind you. And they are wearing casual clothes." Zhuo Yi said seriously.</p>

    <p>"From the Jiugong family?" The girl looked surprised.</p>

    <p>This expression actually gave her away.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the girl did not bring anyone from the Jiugong family out today.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi, who got the answer, looked at Jiugong Liangzi and nodded slightly: "I understand."</p>

    <p>"What do you know?" Jiugong Liangzi wondered.</p>

    <p>"The group of people following you now are probably the enemy."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "However, I don't know what the purpose of their actions is yet. Or is it student Jiugong. Do you have any clues?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know." Jiugong Liangzi shook his head.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that if the Jiugong family secretly sent someone to protect her, it would be impossible to hide this matter.</p>

    <p>"So before I know the purpose of their actions, I suggest that Jiugong Liangzi come with me. It's safer this way." Zhuo Yi said seriously. As he said that, he started to hold Jiugong Liangzi's hand.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing...who wants to hold hands with a liar like you!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi panicked: "Who knows. Did you deliberately arrange those people to tease me?"</p>

    <p>She tried to break free. However, Zhuo Yi's hands were broad and strong, trapping her tightly like a pair of pliers.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiugong, it's too late to explain. You must come with me." At this time, Zhuo Yi looked at Jiugong Liangzi with a serious face.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Jiugong Liangzi was shocked by such a serious look.</p>

    <p>Her mind went blank. She was immediately pulled out by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The girl's delicate hands were held tightly by the man. The mixed heat was transferred between the palms. There was still a slight amount of sweat.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>This man...seems really nervous about her?</p>
