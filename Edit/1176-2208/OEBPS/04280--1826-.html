  <h1>Chapter 1826 The sight from the other side</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is no doubt that this is a crushing education. The holy saint of the holy clan was dragged by Wang Ling by his ankles and beaten on the ground like a scarecrow. There is no longer the shining golden statue when he appeared.</p>

    <p>The Uzumaki's face was now bruised and swollen. Yellow blood was constantly spraying out. Even his breath was much weaker. It felt like he was beaten until he was about to die.</p>

    <p>Such crazy output under the hands of Wang Ling can be described as smooth. Seeing Number 60 High School and Uzumaki Emperor's previous classmates who had no idea about Wang Ling were all dumbfounded. It seemed like they were in a dream. They couldn't believe what they were seeing.</p>

    <p>As expected of father...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu teleported himself to the top of the teaching building. It was an excellent place to watch the battle. The view was wide.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was constantly observing the holy lord who was being beaten crazily.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that compared to the ordinary Eternal Ones, the Holy Lord from the Holy Clan is indeed stronger. And the Holy Lord in front of him in terms of combat power alone. Wang Muyu feels that it is stronger than the previous Jingze and Yan?</p>

    <p>In the end, he was beaten severely by Wang Ling. He was beaten so hard that he had no energy left to fight back.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Muyu also knew that this was not over yet. Each race had its own characteristics.</p>

    <p>They know very little about the Saints. Apart from knowing that they have a strange swirling face, there seems to be nothing strange about them.</p>

    <p>He knew. Although Wang Ling gave him a severe blow, since he didn't kill the opponent directly, he still wanted to test what other methods the saint could come up with.</p>

    <p>"I thought that child was not a normal person before. I didn't expect him to be so cruel!" Chen Chao was excited when he saw it. Although he still hadn't fully digested the facts related to Wang Ling in front of him. But this scene was still able to Let him feel a sense of comfort from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Guo Hao nodded. As a good brother, he was also proud of Wang Ling: "We should have noticed it earlier. After all, not everyone can be like Wang Ling. Every time get precisely average score in all exams... In fact, I also suspected that there was something wrong with Lingzi. For example, we could win several large-scale competitions with him. This is very strange! We are obviously not very strong."</p>

    <p>At this moment, for everyone at Number 60 High School, the existence of Wang Ling has completely surfaced like the sun is shining through the clouds.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, the saint in front of him is still a mystery.</p>

    <p>"He can't kill you. Get up and fight again. No matter what, I'll pull out some of his teeth."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling, Wang Muyu and Sun Rong heard a voice from the other side. A giant golden eye opened from the depths of the universe. The line of sight penetrated layers of space. It actually entered directly. In this inherent spiritual realm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed this mysterious sight.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also followed the line of sight that seemed to be transmitted here from the other side of the universe and saw clearly the body of the giant golden eye.</p>

    <p>For a moment, his thoughts were a little confused.</p>

    <p>Because the appearance of this giant eye is very similar to the "Cosmic Embryo" previously obtained from the Palace of the Outer Gods. That Cosmic Embryo is still in the hands of Wang Ling. It is injected by Wang Ling every day Lots of psychic energy.</p>

    <p>However, that "Cosmic Embryo" is like a baby that can never be fed enough. No matter how Wang Ling injects energy, the buds never bloom.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was thinking whether there was a problem in some link.</p>

    <p>In other words, there is another Cosmic Embryo.</p>

    <p>Both must be collected in order to have a sympathetic response.</p>

    <p>He thought that it might take a long time before new clues could be found about this matter. Unexpectedly, he got new information from the Saints at this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling waited on purpose.</p>

    <p>The Holy Lord, who was on the ground with a bruised face and a bruised face, quickly stood up again with a brand-new attitude.</p>

    <p>Powerful self-healing ability. It can also shorten the duration of serious injury effects.</p>

    <p>This kind of recovery method has to be praised by Wang Ling as being much better than Bai Zhe back then.</p>

    <p>"Gui Laoliu. Try to kill him! If you can't kill him, you will cripple him. How can the reputation of my holy clan be lost in the hands of an earthling?"</p>

    <p>The members of the holy race from the other side of the universe are still instigating him again through the Cosmic Embryo in their hands. They share the same hatred and look like they want to skin Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyelids in a lack of interest. He didn't notice these clowns at all. He stood up again while staring in front of him. The saint known as Gui Laoliu said calmly: "Okay. Is it done?"</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu looked at Wang Ling with a gloomy face and said: "You are too conceited! You are so merciful during the battle? If you want to fight, you have to hit the opponent until there is no room for breathing! I admit that it was me before. I underestimated you. But our Holy Clan is not that easy to deal with."</p>

    <p>He hummed and said. As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately stepped on the ground. In the underground cracks that emerged, countless golden tentacles protruded from them, directly holding Wang Ling's ankle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>It's not that this method is surprising. But the moment the golden tentacles tied his ankles, Wang Ling felt through these tentacles that there was a certain amount of Old Dominator's bloodline power in this saint's body.</p>

    <p>The immortal energy on his body, mixed with the power of chaos, shook these golden tentacles away. He originally wanted to scare these golden tentacles back to the ground, but he didn't expect that these tentacles became more and more courageous as they fought.</p>

    <p>More golden tentacles emerged from the ground, and many glazed scales condensed on the tentacles.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked indifferent. He grabbed one of the tentacles and peeled off the scales. Once again, he was shocked to find that the scales on the tentacles were not ordinary scales. They were dragon scales...</p>

    <p>This is not the most outrageous thing.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is.</p>

    <p>Just after Wang Ling pulled off the dragon scales, these golden tentacles seemed to be stimulated by something again. Countless wings actually grew on their bodies.</p>

    <p>Holy. Crystal clear. And extremely sharp. While swinging the tentacles, these wings instantly turned into blades of light and fell off the golden tentacles. They rushed towards Wang Ling overwhelmingly.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the place where Wang Ling was located was bombed on the spot. Smoke and dust rose in all directions. The land was blazing red after being poured out by huge spiritual energy. It was like being scorched by the sun.</p>

    <p>"So strong." Sun Rong sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>After all, this is within Wang Ling's own inherent spiritual domain. He can still be so unbridled in an environment that is not conducive to him. This saint clan should not be underestimated.</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>However, at this point in the battle. Wang Ling slowly raised a question mark in his heart.</p>

    <p>He had imagined the possibility of many saints. But he never thought that the saints were actually a mixed race... Or to put it more bluntly in modern Internet buzzwords.</p>

    <p>Good job.</p>

    <p>This race is simply the ultimate suture monster!</p>
