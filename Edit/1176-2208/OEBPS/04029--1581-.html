  <h1>Chapter 1581 Immortal Sister Wang Nuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The extremely powerful sword light has a spirituality that relieves all pressure. It suddenly forms a confrontation with the countless resentments in the supreme world.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was shocked by the scene in front of her. She never expected that Wang Nuan's tear would actually turn the situation around at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>In the waiting room. Wang Ling remotely observed the battle. At the same time, the scene was shared in Wang Ming's mind.</p>

    <p>Both brothers are paying close attention to the development of the war situation.</p>

    <p>"Did Leng Ming appear...I see..." The moment he saw the green grass appear, Wang Ming felt relieved.</p>

    <p>He was thinking about a question in his mind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is the immortal king. Then Wang Nuan is the immortal sister.</p>

    <p>Then. Ah Nuan's tears are the legendary... Sister juice!</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>Pretend you didn't hear anything.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's appearance was expected by Wang Ling. Because Leng Ming originally had a savior mechanism. Normally, it may be the blood of the sword master that can trigger this effect similar to the "Savior's Blade."</p>

    <p>This is an implicit rule for all sword spirits produced in the Sword King Realm. As long as the sword master is recognized and the sword spirit is needed, the sword spirit will definitely appear.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling doesn't want Wang Nuan to be harmed in the slightest.</p>

    <p>This rule was forcibly modified especially for Wang Nuan. Just one tear can trigger this protective effect.</p>

    <p>The Supreme World. Accompanied by Leng Ming's emerald green sword light, this place full of desolation and death seemed to be rejuvenated with new vitality.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen looked surprised. He didn't take Leng Ming seriously at first.</p>

    <p>It was just a small tomb grass. It didn't deserve any surprise from him.</p>

    <p>However, when Leng Ming appeared, Fenmu Shen had to admit that he was amazed by the growth of this grass.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming was born as if he had just returned from special training. He obviously had the body of a child, but his body was obviously stronger than before. He seemed to have grown a lot taller.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a gray-green training suit with a strap around his waist. His whole body was filled with an aura of agility, like an elf living in the forest.</p>

    <p>When the sword energy surged, Leng Ming's hair naturally floated, exuding a kind of spirituality.</p>

    <p>With Leng Ming as the center, this barren ancient mountain was instantly covered with tender green grass.</p>

    <p>The wildfire cannot be burned out. The spring breeze blows and rekindles it.</p>

    <p>These grasses possess unimaginable resilience. They are constantly being destroyed and resurrected in this supreme world full of resentment...</p>

    <p>"How could he grow so much."</p>

    <p>When the Sword King Realm was in chaos, Fenmu Shen clearly remembered Leng Ming's appearance at that time.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the changes brought about now are too great.</p>

    <p>"In this supreme world of mine, there is no need to be presumptuous."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen began to become angry. The bare ancient mountain in front of him suddenly turned into an oasis.</p>

    <p>It made him feel extra dazzling.</p>

    <p>The dead and rejuvenated grasses were spreading out like geckos. Fenmu Shen exploded with his final power!</p>

    <p>One hundred percent of the supreme world pressure!</p>

    <p>Bomb them all!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the wailing sound in this world became louder. Resentful screams and painful moans came one after another. It was accompanied by a kind of wailing like a collapse of the sky.</p>

    <p>The billowing black gas surged in from the distant horizon, causing this supreme world to fall into unprecedented depression.</p>

    <p>These black energies transformed into people of different shapes and colors as they approached. Their scarlet eyes exuded a light like the underworld.</p>

    <p>They are all the ancient powerful men who were once killed by Fenmu Shen. Now they are all mobilized by the Supreme World and sacrificed to become an undead army.</p>

    <p>Stepping on black clouds, the uniformly black armor of the undead was so eerie that it made the world tremble.</p>

    <p>The vast army of undead rushed from afar and besieged the green ancient mountain where Wang Nuan was.</p>

    <p>It's a dark place underneath.</p>

    <p>The ancient mountain of Wang Nuan has turned into the only oasis at this moment. It is like the last light in a world that is about to be covered by endless darkness.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid. I will protect you!" Leng Ming frowned slightly and stretched out his strong little arms to block Ah Nuan girl behind him. His small body actually looked like a giant at this moment.</p>

    <p>The first battle after returning from practice was like this. This was also a test for Leng Ming himself.</p>

    <p>But he was not frightened by the hellish scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>Instead, he kept thinking about the combat skills taught to him by his master and mistress during the special training.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he is also measuring the gap in combat power between his side and Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>This is the supreme world of Fenmu Shen. In this world, Fenmu Shen can do everything he wants to do.</p>

    <p>"We can't delay here any longer. We have to find a way to split this world apart."</p>

    <p>So, after thinking carefully, Leng Ming said.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen laughed on the spot when he heard this. He held his stomach. It was as if he had heard the funniest joke in history: "Do you think my highest world is a watermelon? Just chop it if you want? Don't forget. You are just a piece of watermelon." Grass."</p>

    <p>"Shut up! How do you know if you don't give it a blow?" Leng Ming was in an extremely high fighting mood and refused to admit defeat easily.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the undead army in the distance was getting closer. The deep and murderous aura of the sea of blood swept in. It came down with destructive oppression.</p>

    <p>This is an unimaginable deterrent.</p>

    <p>The powerful fluctuations deeply shocked Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming had never felt this level of pressure before. Even when he accepted the mixed doubles match between Jingke and Bai Qiao, the pressure he endured did not seem to be as huge as before.</p>

    <p>"Do you feel the difference?" At this moment, Fenmu Shen slowly reached out and curled his fingers. He slowly closed his palms together. With every inch of force he applied, the energy wave became stronger.</p>

    <p>It seems like there will never be an end.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming began to become nervous, but he still persisted.</p>

    <p>He came here to protect Wang Nuan. He also wanted to show off the results of his special training. He didn't want to embarrass his master.</p>

    <p>"Hey."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Nuan slowly crawled over and lay on Leng Ming's back.</p>

    <p>The soft touch carried the fragrance of baby milk. Leng Ming's face suddenly turned red: "Ah Nuan..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Leng Ming felt a sense of peace of mind.</p>

    <p>It's not just Leng Ming. Wang Nuan also feels the same way.</p>

    <p>Because of the appearance of Leng Ming, the pressure on this world brought by the Supreme World is equivalent to being divided into two parts.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan and Leng Ming. At this time, the two masters and servants share the pressure of the world equally. They have suddenly become each other's salvation.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan said nothing. Like a soft plaster, he held Leng Ming's neck tightly.</p>

    <p>At the next moment, the little girl's eyes began to become sharp.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming understood instantly.</p>

    <p>The real counterattack is about to begin!</p>

    <p>Although Ah Nuan girl was just born, her strategic thinking is extremely clear.</p>

    <p>She blessed Leng Ming with her Shadow power. It only took a moment. The tender green grass that was spreading around began to spread outward at an extremely fast speed...</p>

    <p>The speed of this spread was extremely alarming, forming a green wave that collided with Fenmu Shen's undead army.</p>

    <p>"You actually use the shadow of these grasses to offset the effect of withering..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to think that the little girl in front of him and the grass would have such an unexpected effect.</p>

    <p>If this continues, his supreme world will be completely turned green!</p>
