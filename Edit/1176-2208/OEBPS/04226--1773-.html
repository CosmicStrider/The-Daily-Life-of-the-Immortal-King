  <h1>Chapter 1773 The Tengu's Conspiracy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Nine-core Aohai. The sword energy is so powerful. Even if these two Tengu secret whistles are in the Soul Formation state, they are still vulnerable in front of Sun Rong. They are as small as two ants.</p>

    <p>In the Wisdom Tree, several high-ranking Tengu members with high stars dotted on their foreheads stood tall. They were in control of the overall situation. Although they had already expected that the Office of Strategic Deception would have a way to protect Sun Rong, they did not expect the coming person. The strength is actually so strong.</p>

    <p>Seizing Sun Rong is the main line of their plan. In addition to the main task, the Tengu in the Wisdom Tree also decided to complete their previously planned plan to split the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"Strong sword energy. I wonder what kind of masters the Office of Strategic Deception has sent."</p>

    <p>"This red sword energy looks a bit like the master who went to Duobao City to rescue Jiang Yingying."</p>

    <p>"You mean the woman wearing the nine-tailed fox mask and calling her Wang Mei?"</p>

    <p>"That's right...this person is very strong. She is not even afraid of the last straw left by our predecessors."</p>

    <p>"No problem. Just stick to the original plan!"</p>

    <p>The eight-star tengu named "Eight Master" at the head waved his hand: "No matter how lucky this eldest lady is, there are two tasks in this battle. As long as one is completed, we will win."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong relied on Aohai's disguised sword energy to accurately capture the direction of the Tengu's secret whistle. She knocked the two men unconscious.</p>

    <p>However, as the two men fainted, the location of their accomplices was quickly exposed.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked to find that there were not just two people who ambushed them. These two people just showed up to launch missiles.</p>

    <p>In addition, she also felt the aura of at least a thousand people, all of whom were lurking under the sea water around the island.</p>

    <p>The average strength reaches the Soul Formation level!</p>

    <p>A thousand-strong Soul Formation army!</p>

    <p>To describe it as scary is not an exaggeration at all!</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin. What is the island below our immortal boat?"</p>

    <p>"It's the Nantian Islands." Butler Lin quickly replied. He knew the current geographical location information very clearly.</p>

    <p>This is an immortal island in the South Huaxiu Sea of Huaxiu Country. Although the island is not large, it was brutally invaded by Mixiu Country's sea-based immortal team a few years ago because of its rich resources.</p>

    <p>Although this group of people was later expelled, the Nantian Islands are still not at peace in the past few years. In all likelihood, there are people who want to visit the islands.</p>

    <p>Over time, the Nantian Islands also became a controversial immortal island in the South Huaxiu Sea under the leadership of Mixiu Country. It was used by Mixiu Country as a cultivation strategy to achieve the purpose of containment.</p>

    <p>After listening to Butler Lin's introduction, Sun Rong immediately frowned deeply: "Uncle Lin, there are thousands of people hiding under the sea of Nantian Islands...a full army. Is this normal?"</p>

    <p>"An army? Is this what the lady sensed with the magic weapon of that Wang Piaoliang?"</p>

    <p>"That's right...the magic weapon my master gave me is very powerful..."</p>

    <p>"The Nantian Islands are called the maritime border. They are one of the symbols of the territorial waters of our country, Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, the maritime garrison on our island is less than 500 people. Because the nearby seaside immortal ships can be transferred at any time for support. They are stationed on the island in the wind and sun every day. In this way, groups go to the sea and dive into the water. Such behavior...is definitely not their style..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin couldn't help but frown as he spoke. Then soon, cold sweat broke out on his forehead.</p>

    <p>If these cultivators lurking in the sea are not garrisoned at the sea border, then they are most likely invading enemies...</p>

    <p>Things seem to be getting complicated.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin didn't expect that they would encounter such a thing on this green route leading to Mixiu Country.</p>

    <p>"The Nantian Islands are called the maritime border. They are one of the symbols of the territorial waters of our country Huaxiu. They must not be handed over." Butler Lin said: "Miss. The maritime garrison will handle this matter. It is not appropriate for us to interfere."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "So maybe the appearance of this group of people is not aimed at me?"</p>

    <p>Butler Lin: "It's hard to say now..."</p>

    <p>"But they took two shots. It can't be in vain, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, she said: "Let's do this, Uncle Lin. You ask the captain to raise the height of the immortal boat a little more. We will hang in the air and wait and see. If this group of people persists, we can also think of ways to support the defenders." Originally, she only wanted to get rid of the two Tengu bastards under her and join Wang Ling as soon as possible, but she didn't expect to encounter such a thing on the way.</p>

    <p>As a young person who has received modern patriotism education, she now has the strength to defend her home and country. At the same time, she is also full of passion and the chivalrous spirit of a generation of cultivators because of her youth.</p>

    <p>Encountering such a thing, Sun Rong felt that she really couldn't sit back and ignore it.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Miss..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin nodded. He knew Sun Rong's personality. Once she decided to do something, he couldn't dissuade her.</p>

    <p>He had no choice but to agree temporarily and then think of other ways.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important point is that he must find a way to protect the safety of Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>He was thinking in his mind. Then he heard Sun Rong look at him and say: "Uncle Lin, protect yourself. If a fight breaks out, the magic weapon my master gave me may not be used in the immortal boat. I'm sure I'm going out to fight."</p>

    <p>"I...protect myself?" Butler Lin looked stunned.</p>

    <p>"That's right, Uncle Lin. Just protect yourself. Otherwise, I will have to protect you while fighting." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Butler Lin was even more stunned.</p>

    <p>He had never heard of this Wang Piaoliang. If it hadn't been for the kidnapping of Martial Saint's adopted daughter last time, he would never have thought that there was such a person hidden in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>However, there is no doubt about Wang Piaoliang's strength. She can single-handedly rescue Jiang Yingying unscathed... This alone is already strong enough.</p>

    <p>But when did Wang Piaoliang accept Sun Rong as her disciple? Butler Lin was really curious.</p>

    <p>If the young lady really gets into a fight with these invading enemies now, how will she behave?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, after following Fenlei from Glio City, he checked into the hotel where he was staying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling operates the pupil force. The scene of the pupil force being dispersed and released into the void is directly switched to the Nantian Islands.</p>

    <p>This is no longer peeking at the screen. This is looking at it openly.</p>

    <p>Mainly because Wang Muyu also wants to see it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can only follow the little guy's wishes.</p>

    <p>When Glio City Fenlei saw this, he was filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>As expected of Ling Zhenren. Even when peeking into the screen, he is so confident.</p>

    <p>"Is it...Mom?" Wang Muyu shouted excitedly after seeing the picture.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't care much about Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>He was just worried about the little moves by the Tengu. He knew that the Thousand Soul Formations currently lurking in the Nantian Islands were planned by the Tengu. He had a vague feeling that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Previously, although the two missiles that attacked the immortal boat on which Sun Rong was traveling failed, they still attracted the attention of the garrison at sea.</p>

    <p>At this time, a man with a lean figure and extraordinary equipment wearing a blue robe stood up. His name was Li Weiwei. He was the leader of the Nantian Islands Maritime Garrison.</p>

    <p>He stood at the front and shouted to the surroundings with the loudest sound transmission spell: "Those who trespass on the sea border will be killed without mercy!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, the sound was overwhelming. The sound waves spread out and shook the sea surface. The waves were rolled up by tens of meters and swept away in all directions.</p>
