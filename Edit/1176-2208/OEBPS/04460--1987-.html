  <h1>Chapter 1987 Su Xingyue's Reconciliation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the school guard of Number 60 High School. It is also crucial to remember the faces of everyone who comes in contact with Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Campus security is of vital importance. Heavenly Dao now has an unshirkable responsibility as the chief of school security. So almost every day he browses the records of wanted criminals on the Internet and updates the memory bank in his mind. Their appearance is deep in his mind.</p>

    <p>Just a few days ago, he punished a human trafficker who was sneaking around campus.</p>

    <p>At that time, the death of Heavenly Dao directly planted "Heavenly Dao Death Knell" in his soul. It is a seed type spell that can slowly deduct life span. It acts directly on the soul.</p>

    <p>The implanted person will not feel anything. As long as he has the idea of doing evil, his life span will be -1. Once it reaches 0, he will die suddenly...</p>

    <p>In addition, if the evil thoughts are carried out directly, Heavenly Dao's death knell's crisis warning mechanism will be triggered immediately, which will also kill the person.</p>

    <p>The main reason for doing this was Death Heavenly Dao didn't want the trafficker to die directly at the school gate. Otherwise, it would be troublesome for Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>He didn't want people to think that some evil person came to Number 60 High School and died in the workplace. He died on the way...</p>

    <p>Of course, the above-mentioned disciplinary actions are only aimed at those evildoers who violate laws and disciplines and are heinous.</p>

    <p>Treating Su Xingyue. Death Heavenly Dao feels that there is no need to go to this point yet.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Su, what are you doing here at Number 60 High School?" Death Heavenly Dao directly reached out and intercepted Su Xingyue at the door of Number 60 High School. It was about to be the end of school. Su Xingyue chose this time to come to Death Heavenly Dao still felt strange.</p>

    <p>After all, there was a "history" of spying on the combat strength data of Number 60 High School students last time. Heavenly Dao actually didn't have a good impression of Su Xingyue. In addition, Wang Ling had just told him to be careful. Intelligence spies sent by Shengke.</p>

    <p>So it was even more impossible for him to let Su Xingyue in.</p>

    <p>"I'm here to see my classmate Sun Rong... She is the student union president of Number 60 High School, right?" Su Xingyue said politely. She no longer had the same superiority as when she came to Number 60 High School last time.</p>

    <p>She looked at the young man who stopped her in front of her. The expression between her eyebrows was slightly startled. This was the uniform of the chief security officer of 60 High School. She recognized it.</p>

    <p>The last time she came to Number 60 High School, the chief security guard hadn't shown up yet. It seems that Number 60 High School has tightened security recently.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao's human form is very young. He is probably in his early twenties. However, under normal circumstances, cultivators with social experience never judge their behavior based on their appearance.</p>

    <p>So even though the human form of Death Heavenly Dao looked very young, Su Xingyue did not dare to neglect it at all. She had her own intuition. She felt that the young man in front of her was mysterious and unpredictable. There was an indescribable sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>"Then you and classmate Sun, do you have an appointment?" Death Heavenly Dao said without any nonsense and went straight to the topic.</p>

    <p>"That's not the case yet..." Su Xingyue said awkwardly.</p>

    <p>In fact, the last time she came here, she tried to add Sun Rong to WeChat. The result was directly rejected. This made Su Xingyue slightly speechless.</p>

    <p>Since becoming the new president of the Shengke Student Union, Su Xingyue feels that she is actually under a lot of pressure. On the other hand, she actually does not want to have too much trouble with Number 60 High School. Therefore, this time she comes here for the purpose of friendship and communication.</p>

    <p>In addition, she also asked Qu Shuling for mercy...</p>

    <p>Others don't know what happens in the spirit world, but Su Xingyue has her own intelligence network.</p>

    <p>She knew that Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan had a good relationship with Wang Ling, so she wanted to try to communicate with Wang Ling first. If she could get help from Wang Ling, then she could follow the lead and get Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan. Zhang Linyan's letter of understanding. Qu Shuling may not have to face the fate of being hidden.</p>

    <p>Of course. Su Xingyue knew that getting close to Wang Ling was actually not an easy task.</p>

    <p>That's why she came to see Sun Rong now.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing you can do without a reservation. Student Su, you definitely can't go in. If you want to see classmate Sun Rong. Maybe you can wait until she comes out from school and try to find her." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"Can't you just be accommodating?"</p>

    <p>"No. This is my duty. Please don't make things difficult for me, Ms. Su."</p>

    <p>"But your Number 60 High School has always maintained an open and inclusive attitude..."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue was a little anxious. She didn't expect that the attitude of the school guard chief would be so tough.</p>

    <p>"The school spirit of our school has always been like this. It promotes righteousness and has a correct school spirit. But we can't let people who deliberately test the information of our school's students enter the school for the second time, right?" Death Heavenly Dao laughed.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue: "..."</p>

    <p>Her temptation was discovered last time...</p>

    <p>No wonder she wasn't allowed in.</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue sighed inwardly. She thought the last test was perfect. She didn't expect it to be exposed like that.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she knew that Qu Shuling made a big mistake in this spiritual world trial. He had murderous intentions when facing students from the same camp. Although he did not succeed in the end, the Jingmi Institute wanted to hide him. It gave me the most face-saving result.</p>

    <p>Now she is brazenly trying to ask Number 60 High School to help obtain a letter of understanding from Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan... This step may be as difficult as heaven.</p>

    <p>But Su Xingyue still wanted to give it a try as much as possible.</p>

    <p>After all, no one knows Qu Shuling's past better than she does. As someone who came from the same school as him, Su Xingyue felt that she and Qu Shuling should have had a brother-sister relationship that transcended blood relations over the years.</p>

    <p>So she was willing to risk being looked down upon and come here.</p>

    <p>To Heavenly Dao's surprise, Su Xingyue actually raised her head in the next second. The determination in her eyes remained unabated. The light of the setting sun illuminated the maple leaf-style Hanfu on her body red.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I won't bother Mr. President. I'll wait here for classmate Sun Rong to come out." She said to Heavenly Dao. Then she stood upright at the school gate.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao originally wanted Su Xingyue to give up. Girls all want to save face. Besides, Su Xingyue is not an ordinary high school student. Her popularity is no less than that of Qu Shuling. Even if she wears a mask now, as long as she stands at the school gate for a while, she will be recognized quickly.</p>

    <p>If people on the Internet knew that she came to Number 60 High School this time for reconciliation, it would undoubtedly be an epic slap in the face for Shengko itself.</p>

    <p>The principal there issued a letter of challenge to protect the calf. As a result, the student union president came to Number 60 High School to seek reconciliation.</p>

    <p>Netizens will definitely think that Shengke University, which is known as the number one university, is probably nothing more than that.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, how could such a logically confusing decision be made?</p>

    <p>At the same time. Number 60 High School student union office.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at Su Xingyue at the school gate for a long time.</p>

    <p>To be honest, such a firm look in her eyes made her slightly moved.</p>

    <p>If Su Xingyue continues to stand at the school gate, someone will recognize her soon and it will cause further sensation. Then how can classmate Wang Ling leave school quietly?</p>

    <p>Having no choice but to do so, Sun Rong could only sigh in her heart. She immediately sent a message to Death Heavenly Dao: "Senior, please let her in. But school will be over soon. Be careful to stay hidden. Take her directly through the teleportation channel. Student Union Office. Don't cause trouble to classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Got it." Death Heavenly Dao smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>In the end she did this for Wang Ling, rather than to give Su Xingyue face...</p>
