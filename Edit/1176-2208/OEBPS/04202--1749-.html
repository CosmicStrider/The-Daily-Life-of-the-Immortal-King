  <h1>Chapter 1749 Unlucky Jiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The gold-eating bug was originally a miniature creature that appeared in ancient tombs. It was generated due to the special geographical environment. It was also extremely afraid of light.</p>

    <p>The first one to develop gold-eating insects and use them in a commercial model is a well-known construction company in the cultivation circle. It is called Casio Heavy Industries. This is a construction company originating from Mixiu Country. It is also the first to use genetic technology to commercialize gold-eating insects. The gold bug genes are recombinantly modified to make them easy to tame and maneuverable.</p>

    <p>You only need to lock the designated block through a smart device. The gold-eating insect can quickly grow in scale and swallow up all the metal substances.</p>

    <p>At present, in the world of cultivation, gold-eating insects are also mostly used in demolition and other work. The advantage is that it is environmentally friendly and pollution-free. It does not produce excessive smoke and dust. But it also has a drawback. That is, the metal eaten by gold-eating insects cannot be recycled.</p>

    <p>So now the gold-eating bug is also used in some door-breaking operations to rescue hostages.</p>

    <p>Of course. Currently, in the world of cultivation, gold-eating insects also tend to be used by criminals...</p>

    <p>For example, now.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu is well versed in deceiving people. He is extremely confident in the information he just used a few sentences to extract. He also firmly believes that the person in the room is "Sun Rong" herself.</p>

    <p>The daughter of a consortium. Why does she live in such a humble and affordable apartment?</p>

    <p>According to Yin Hu, there is only one answer.</p>

    <p>That is this place. It is the humble residence of this wealthy young lady and her sweetheart!</p>

    <p>This must be the case!</p>

    <p>And when the gold-eating bug silently devoured an entire metal security door, Jiang Yingying suddenly panicked when facing the clinic doctor who suddenly appeared in front of her.</p>

    <p>"Who... are you..." No matter how stupid she was, she knew at this moment that these were two intruders. And they were definitely not the so-called community clinic doctors.</p>

    <p>She tried to shout, but Yin Hu moved very quickly. He just made a silencing gesture at the corner of his mouth. Jiang Yingying instantly felt that her throat was being strangled by an invisible force. She was unable to speak.</p>

    <p>This is the most basic "gag curse."</p>

    <p>Due to frequent use, Yin Hu has been trained to the highest level. Not only can it accurately target silence in an instant, but it can also activate a group "silencing spell" within a radius of ten kilometers.</p>

    <p>If the curse is not removed, the cursed person will enter a state of aphasia within 10 hours and will be unable to make any sound.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, I'm sorry. We have to ask you to come with us." At this time, Yin Hu took the initiative to step forward and used the customized Qiankun bag to completely cover Jiang Yingying. Then the Qiankun bag shrank in his hands. It's only as big as a palm. It's like a Pok√©mon ball.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu held the Qiankun Bag in his palm. He could clearly feel that Jiang Yingying in the bag was struggling with extreme fear. However, the struggle soon disappeared.</p>

    <p>This is not because Jiang Yingying gave up resistance. It is because the Qiankun bag, which is specially used to capture people, has a certain hypnotic effect.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, the Yin Hu and Daishu beside him evacuated the scene neatly and quickly.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, they did not forget to cast a simple illusion on the door of Jiang Yingying's house. They reinstalled the metal door that had been eaten by gold-eating insects.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying gradually regained consciousness. Yin Hu had released her from the Qiankun Bag. She was blindfolded and had her hands tied behind her back. However, she could still clearly feel that she was in a high-speed moving car.</p>

    <p>"I have broken your silence spell, Miss Sun." The Yin Hu smiled and stared at "Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was speechless for a while: "No... no. You have misunderstood. I am not Sun Rong at all..."</p>

    <p>"This is impossible."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu: "My judgment has never been wrong. Ms. Sun, even if you cut your hair short and change the hairstyle that appeared on TV before, we still know that you are Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>"You know who my grandfather is. My grandfather is very powerful. He is Martial Saint..."</p>

    <p>"I know. After all, he is the leader of a group.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun's strength is indeed the same as that of Martial Saint among the ten generals."..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Miss Sun, we will never hurt you. We just need to take you to a place and then take a video for you. You only need to explain clearly to the camera what you have done. Already."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu crossed his fingers and propped up his knees with his elbows. He looked at "Sun Rong" and said, "When all this is done, we will naturally let you go back."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiang Yingying only felt aggrieved. Tears were already welling up in her eyes, gradually soaking through the whole cloth covering her eyes.</p>

    <p>It's not like she doesn't know that she looks a bit similar to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In the past, she even thought that this was a gift given to her by God. Since Sun Rong can pursue Wang Ling, then she can do the same.</p>

    <p>At least in terms of appearance, she and Sun Rong are equal. And who Wang Ling will fall in love with in the end is the result of her and Sun Rong's respective abilities.</p>

    <p>But now when she was once again mistaken as "Sun Rong" and kidnapped. For the first time, Jiang Yingying had the idea of resenting her own appearance...</p>

    <p>Why should she suffer such a sin for Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>It's obviously not her fault!</p>

    <p>Trying to stop the tears and calm down. Jiang Yingying tried to negotiate with Yin Hu again: "That... I can tell you clearly that I am not Sun Rong, my last name is Jiang. You've really got the wrong person. But don't be discouraged... you can start over if you made a mistake... I won't blame you... you're not the first to get it wrong anyway..."</p>

    <p>However, facing Jiang Yingying's words, Yin Hu didn't believe it at all: "Miss Sun, don't pretend anymore at this time. We have already checked your mobile phone contacts. The one named Jiang Xiaoche in it is your driver and... Currently the Secretary-General of Huaguo Shuilian Group?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was stunned by these words and was momentarily speechless.</p>

    <p>"Let me tell you, Miss Sun. As long as you tell your affairs honestly, there will be no problem. Let me ask you a few questions first. You can make a draft in your mind first to avoid stumbling when recording the video later."</p>

    <p>At this point, Yin Hu took out his notebook again: "First question. After the child was born, were any drugs used to induce growth?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "?"</p>

    <p>"The second question. Where did the child come from? Who was born to him? When was he born?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "No... what's going on with this kid you guys are asking about?"</p>

    <p>Yin Hu Haha: "Ms. Sun, what's the point of acting like this now? Your kid can even go down to the soy sauce store."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "???"</p>
