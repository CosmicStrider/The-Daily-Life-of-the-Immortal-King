  <h1>Chapter 1738 Dragon Fist is by my side</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The space enhancement was countered and backfired on the spot, which Ling Yue never expected, the strength of the double was limited by her summoning, although not as strong as the body, but suddenly received this slap, the state of the unexpected Ling Yue is certainly not easy to bear.</p>

    <p>She was beaten so much that blood oozed from the corners of her mouth. There was a distinct fingerprint on her face. There were also faint traces of her face being cut by sharp nails.</p>

    <p>"You Bitch! You always use us to block the knife! I can't stand you for a long time! Hawk Tuah!" Earlier, the space double who had taken the initiative to go forward and hit Ling Yue had not forgotten to spit a mouthful of phlegm on Ling Yue's body after she finished hitting her.</p>

    <p>And how could Ling Yue be a person willing to suffer such humiliation?</p>

    <p>So at this moment, her psychic energy surged again. But the target was not Sun Rong, Wang Muyu or Wang Ming. It was her own substitute.</p>

    <p>Although dragonborn possess the genes of dragon power, half of their genes essentially belong to human cultivators.</p>

    <p>So the facts prove that the fight between women and women is not much different from the fight between dragon girl and dragon girl.</p>

    <p>"Mom, look, there are two aunts here!" Under Wang Muyu's clapping and cheering, Ling Yue and her space double fought fiercely. From the beginning, they pulled each other's hair, and then rolled all over the floor. The posture is very similar to those female stars who compete in variety shows.</p>

    <p>"You can actually break their spatial link?" Sun Rong asked, touching Wang Muyu's little head.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu squinted his eyes and looked like he was enjoying it. After a while, he answered: "That's right! But I didn't know their links were so fragile and they would break as soon as I poked it."</p>

    <p>After several battles, both Ling Yue and the space double suffered a lot of injuries. A piece of Ling Yue's hair was plucked out. Ling Yue advanced from the aunt to the "Fire Cloud Evil God."</p>

    <p>"Aunts, come on! Take back your sovereignty!" Wang Muyu was on the side, looking like he was watching the fun and not taking it too seriously.</p>

    <p>But what he said was to those space substitutes: "The main thing is to defeat this Auntie. You will be free! And when the time comes, the Auntie will become a substitute. You can elect one of you to replace the main body and stay here!"</p>

    <p>Something that makes Sun Rong feel a little surprised. Although Wang Muyu is not very old, he seems to have a good way of provoking troubles.</p>

    <p>"Stand-in aunties! You can no longer be oppressed! You have to stand up! You have to fight! You have to resist!"</p>

    <p>"A double's life is a life! It can't be taken out and used by the body! Who isn't a good aunt with a pure heart?"</p>

    <p>"I resigned from the White Emperor in the colorful clouds, but the Dragon Fist is right beside me! There's always love in the world. Can I give her two punches?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>She didn't even know where Wang Muyu learned his trouble-making ability. But if he hadn't been online frequently, he would never have been able to carry out targeted strikes so accurately.</p>

    <p>Listening to Wang Muyu's words, these substitutes began to get excited one by one. They began to feel angry in their hearts and grew evil. They geared up and stared at Ling Yue, as if they were ready to attack.</p>

    <p>"Don't listen to his deception. This is all their plan!" Ling Yue, who was beaten with a bruised nose and face, began to fight back.</p>

    <p>"Plot? No. I think he is right! Even if we are substitutes, we still have the right to pursue equality!"</p>

    <p>The first space double snorted dissatisfied: "You should know very well what you have done to us when we were stand-ins. In your eyes, we can just be used and abandoned by you at any time, blocking the way for you. It's just a tool of the Dragon Man!"</p>

    <p>"Equal rights! Equal rights! We want equal rights!"</p>

    <p>Ling Yue: "..."</p>

    <p>However, this is not the most desperate. The most desperate thing is Wang Muyu's next sentence: "Come on, stand-ins! I support you! Come here. I will give you some reinforcements!"</p>

    <p>Because he knows how to use space abilities, it is easy for Wang Muyu to use his own means to strengthen these space dragon dragonborn avatars.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Therefore, this battle was not without its cruelty. Under the tide of punches and kicks, Ling Yue was finally beaten to the point of dying.</p>

    <p>These space avatars were also discussed. The one who fought the most fiercely in the queue was chosen to stay here instead of Ling Yue. She became the new Ling Yue and exchanged space with Ling Yue's body.</p>

    <p>The remaining substitutes will each return to their original spaces.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, sisters. I am different from this Bitch. I will never treat you as tools. Just now, everyone's dragon punch was very good! It fully highlights our modern female dragon descendants' pursuit of equal rights and their beautiful yearning for freedom, and in the future, I will continue to carry this vision and work hard with all the sisters to create a better future!"</p>

    <p>After a series of declarations of taking office.</p>

    <p>A burst of thunderous applause erupted from the scene.</p>

    <p>At this point, the action regarding Ling Yue's capture of Wang Muyu has come to an end...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Little Wang!"</p>

    <p>After all the space avatars were pushed away, Xin Ling Yue turned around and bowed to Wang Muyu with clasped fists: "From now on, Xin Ling Yue will follow you, Mr. Wang!"</p>

    <p>"Okay, sister." Wang Muyu smiled and changed his words quickly. For a moment, the whole air fell into a happy atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help laughing in her heart.</p>

    <p>She didn't know how to describe Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>This little guy...</p>

    <p>He is really talking about people and ghosts.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if those words that sounded so sincere were the words he blurted out in a childlike manner or were the result of careful consideration.</p>

    <p>In short, she could feel Wang Muyu's thoughts. He was by no means an ordinary child.</p>

    <p>Not only is he strong in ability, but his ideas are also different from those of ordinary children of this age.</p>

    <p>After the new Ling Yue was successfully recruited, the expression on Wang Muyu's face became serious again: "It's so annoying, Mom. They seem to have sent someone here again."</p>

    <p>"The mission of Bitch in front failed. I'm afraid they already know it. So it's not surprising to send someone here." Xin Ling Yue said. She sensed the person's aura. Immediately, her whole expression changed drastically: "This... Is it the scent of SCB-l001?"</p>

    <p>"Is it that uncle named Jingze?" Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>"It's him." Xin Ling Yue nodded: "He is the first born among all our dragon descendants. He is also the oldest dragon descendant. And now he is also covered with the eternal moon starlight! That was given by the Moon Dragon Lord. The overall reinforcement he exerts..."</p>

    <p>Tian-level laboratory. Several people were communicating and moving at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Huh? But how do I feel? His attention doesn't seem to be on me?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu showed a puzzled expression.</p>

    <p>When he used his space ability to transfer everyone out of the sky-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>Introduce the scene before you.</p>

    <p>It's the scene where Jingze, wearing two diamond gloves and holding a black umbrella, fights a young man in sportswear...</p>

    <p>They were facing each other. The expression on Jingze's face was obviously solemn.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He remembered...</p>

    <p>Before he died, monk Jin Deng asked him to find the young man.</p>

    <p>Oh.</p>

    <p>Now, he has been imbued with the eternal moon starlight and has become stronger.</p>

    <p>Bad luck for him!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Little did he know that at this time. Wang Ling also thought the same way.</p>
