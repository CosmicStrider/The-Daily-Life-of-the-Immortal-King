  <h1>Chapter 1500 Take Wang Ling to climb the mountain</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was half leaning over to look at the second goods in front of him.</p>

    <p>He felt that this was a favor and that he should help.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming rarely came to him specifically for his own matters. On the contrary, he would go to Wang Ming for Talisman's matters from time to time.</p>

    <p>And the root of this matter is. For Wang Ling on the other hand, it is also for his your own consideration.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was born unable to practice. But he is recognized as the most powerful brain.</p>

    <p>Although Zhai Yin is not the strongest brain, he actually has the Nascent Soul state at a young age.</p>

    <p>From a certain perspective, Zhai Yin is actually a genius-level cultivator on earth.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. Because of the relationship between Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Most geniuses pale in comparison to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Zhai Yin's foundation is actually very good. At this age of Nascent Soul stage, there is a lot of potential in the future.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that in terms of growth rate, given time, it will not be difficult for Zhai Yin to surpass the current ten generals in combat power.</p>

    <p>And with such complementarity, the offspring created by Wang Ming and Zhai Yin... from a genetic point of view, should be very strong!</p>

    <p>So after hearing Wang Ming's request.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling began to think about what would happen to the two of them in the future.</p>

    <p>What if Wang Ming still can't solve his Talisman problem? Then there will be a little Wang Ming around in the future. That sounds quite reassuring.</p>

    <p>But having said that.</p>

    <p>"Enlightment" shouldn't be used indiscriminately.</p>

    <p>There is a question of balance that needs to be addressed here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's current physical fitness is indeed very weak. But if he uses 100% enlightenment, it seems to be a bit too strong.</p>

    <p>So after thinking about it comprehensively, Wang Ling stretched out his hand from the bed and gently tapped Wang Ming's forehead.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the golden light that quickly disappeared, the enlightenment technique had been used.</p>

    <p>"Is this the end?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stunned. He felt that his body had not changed much, and he had no special feeling.</p>

    <p>"This is 1% enlightenment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Chuanyin Road.</p>

    <p>Combined with Wang Ming's current actual situation, 1% enlightenment is actually the safest.</p>

    <p>His "attunement technique" can originally achieve the grading of the degree of attunement development.</p>

    <p>It's just a 1% "attunement technique." Wang Ling is rarely used.</p>

    <p>As for whether it is useful or not, we still have to combine it with practical training to know.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming obviously understood something from Wang Ling's beautiful dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, he rushed into the toilet.</p>

    <p>He didn't come out of the toilet until two hours later.</p>

    <p>"Ten ten! Ling Ling. You are too strong!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming jumped onto the bed and exclaimed: "I'm still not weak after damn... two hours..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Only you know your actual situation best.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that Wang Ming's usual highest record is only 20 minutes... and to reach this peak state, it depends on a certain probability.</p>

    <p>But now. Wang Ming found that he had really become stronger.</p>

    <p>1% enlightenment turned him into a real tough guy!</p>

    <p>And he felt that he should actually be able to last longer.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I was in the toilet just now. The two hours are not over yet. This makes Wang Ming a little impatient.</p>

    <p>In the end, I could only take another shower of cold water to force myself to regain my composure.</p>

    <p>"This is so easy to use. It's really powerful."</p>

    <p>As he talked, Wang Ming began to wrap himself around Wang Ling with the quilt as before.</p>

    <p>But the difference is that this time it's exciting.</p>

    <p>He suddenly realized that it was really great to have such a younger brother!</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ming sat up. He looked at Wang Ling with a serious face: "Don't worry, Ling Ling. Your brother will definitely take care of your Talisman problem before you graduate from high school. I'll fix your Talisman problem before you graduate from high school. If I don't. I'll be impotent for life!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned when he heard these words.</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly. Wang Ming finally said something human...</p>

    <p>But this oath was too harsh.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the attunement technique is not the consecration technique. It does not have the ability of Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the research is not done by then, it will become a prophecy.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Wang Ming will regret it for the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>"Then go to bed early, Ling Ling. There will be activities starting at three o'clock tomorrow."</p>

    <p>His request was fulfilled. Wang Ming was satisfied.</p>

    <p>Before he got out of bed, he wanted to kiss Wang Ling secretly. But he found that Wang Ling was already on guard. He retracted his head into the quilt, like a kangaroo.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. Before leaving, he just patted Wang Ling's butt.</p>

    <p>He said good night in a unique way of saying hello between men.</p>

    <p>Then he returned to his room.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming was lying on the bed. He closed his eyes quietly and seemed to be resting.</p>

    <p>But in fact, his mind never stopped calculating.</p>

    <p>That poisonous oath just now. Wang Ming was very serious. And he didn't mean to brag.</p>

    <p>But I do have this confidence.</p>

    <p>Ten years have passed since Wang Ling's first version of Talisman to now.</p>

    <p>In these ten years, the calculations in Wang Ming's mind have never stopped...</p>

    <p>And there was an intuition that told Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He will soon find the answer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong and Zhai Yin are both sleepless.</p>

    <p>That night, the two had an in-depth exchange on the topic of "unrequited love."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin directly moved the big bed from another room and put it together with Sun Rong. The two rolled around on the bed for a while, smiling brightly.</p>

    <p>Originally Sun Rong planned to call two masseuses over for essential oil treatments.</p>

    <p>But when she thought about some relatively private topics to be discussed between her and Zhai Yin, she gave up the idea.</p>

    <p>"Let me help you, Miss Rong." Zhai Yin volunteered.</p>

    <p>"Just call me Rongrong. Miss Rong is too outspoken! Then I'll help Sister Yinzi with her back later." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Zhai Yin agreed readily.</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong unbuckled the belt behind his back and lay down on the spacious bed.</p>

    <p>There are two layers of white bath towels placed under the body to prevent the essential oil from slipping and dripping on the sheets.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin took the essential oil prepared by Sun Rong in advance and poured a little on the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>A strong but not so pungent fragrance came. It was extremely fresh and had a refreshing smell.</p>

    <p>"What a special essential oil. It's actually pink. I've never seen it before." Zhai Yin marveled.</p>

    <p>"This anti-wrinkle, whitening and anti-oxidant aging effect is very good! It can also break down moles and acne!" Sun Rong said with a smile: "This is a newly developed product by our family. If you don't mind it, Sister Yinzi. Later. I'll give you a new bottle."</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong missed something. This newly developed product has not actually been launched yet, because the ingredients in it are not all found on the earth.</p>

    <p>The main extract of this bottle of pink essential oil comes from the Star of Youth that was recycled from the old Rubik's Cube by Sun Rong. It was originally a pink spring water substance called the Fountain of Youth on the Star of Youth.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong knows. Zhai Yin may not know that much so far.</p>

    <p>I didn't go into too much detail.</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much!" Zhai Yin was not polite at all.</p>

    <p>Immediately, she rubbed the essential oil into her palms to warm it. She started from the girl's smooth and white shoulder blades and pushed outwards as if doing Tai Chi.</p>

    <p>"Uh..."Sun Rong couldn't hold it back for a moment and actually shouted out.</p>

    <p>Because it's so comfortable!</p>

    <p>"Why does it feel like Sister Yinzi looks very professional..."</p>

    <p>"In the army, comrades often get sprained during training, so we have some massage techniques."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin smiled and said: "Just enjoy it. My craftsmanship is no worse than that of the teachers and fathers in the shops outside."</p>

    <p>"Haha. Sister Yinzi is amazing..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong closed his eyes. The expression on his face was very satisfied.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's hands are like a pair of magician's hands. Various massage techniques emerge in endlessly. She uses her skill to melt the essential oil on the girl's back little by little.</p>

    <p>This skin is white and smooth. Even at a close distance, it seems that the pores are not visible.</p>

    <p>Seeing this made Zhai Yin feel envious.</p>

    <p>There are no outsiders here. Zhai Yin's technique is so comfortable that Sun Rong almost falls asleep.</p>

    <p>But soon she suddenly remembered that the focus of tonight was not exactly maintenance.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong quickly got into the topic and asked something that he had wanted to ask for a long time: "Sister Yinzi, have you fallen in love with Brother Ming a long time ago?"</p>

    <p>"This... how do you know?" Zhai Yin's fingers paused: "Is it obvious?"</p>

    <p>"No. Just intuition."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head slightly and lay on the bed and said: "Sister Yinzi and I have never met before. I remember that sister Yinzi just came out of the arrival gate today. Your eyes have been looking at Brother Ming. Every minute. , not a second was missed."</p>

    <p>"Is it that exaggerated?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's face felt a little hot when she was told that.</p>

    <p>"Have you? Sister Yinzi, don't you have any idea?"Sun Rong slightly raised the corners of her lips.</p>

    <p>The reason why she could detect the admiration in Zhai Yin's eyes at a glance today.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, this has something to do with myself.</p>

    <p>Because Sun Rong discovered that the way Zhai Yin looked at Wang Ming was very similar to the way he looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of urgency in the tenderness. At the same time, it is mixed with a little resentment of "hating that iron cannot become steel." But more of it is a wanton outflow of love...</p>

    <p>"It was indeed you, Brother Ming, who I paid attention to first."</p>

    <p>With a smile in his eyes, Zhai Yin told his story: "I saw him by chance during a mission."</p>

    <p>"Then you fell in love?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Zhai Yin nodded.</p>

    <p>"What happened later,"</p>

    <p>"And then I was like a nymphomaniac. I've been investigating his leads."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin cried and laughed, "But as you know, Er Ming's true identity is not simple..."</p>

    <p>Er Ming, that's Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>This is Zhai Yin's nickname for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"When I investigated him at that time, I found that his identity was made up of multiple matryoshka dolls. Each one was fake."</p>

    <p>"So I once doubted whether he was a spy sent by other countries."</p>

    <p>"puff!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>I never thought there would be something like this...</p>

    <p>"His identity was kept strictly confidential by superiors. But I was a bit stubborn at the time. I kept investigating secretly and collecting evidence that Er Ming was a spy. After my boss found out about me, he was so angry that he punished me. Several times."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Then I was contacted by President Qi. He happened to be helping Wang Ming recruit guards. My boss saw this as an opportunity and took the initiative to contact me. Then I was assigned. That is, I didn't know until that time. Turns out he is not a spy."</p>

    <p>"That's great."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was full of envy: "If Brother Ming knew about it, he would definitely laugh silly, right?"</p>

    <p>"According to his temper, he will definitely make fun of me! But I think since we are together, we shouldn't have any reservations." Zhai Yin said.</p>

    <p>After saying so much.</p>

    <p>In a daze, Zhai Yin did think of many things.</p>

    <p>She thought of the days when she began to admire Wang Ming. She felt a sense of melancholy in her heart.</p>

    <p>How she got here during those days. Only Zhai Yin knows.</p>

    <p>Now I finally have the fruits of victory. Looking back on all the choices I made in the past, Zhai Yin feels that everything was worth it.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin once didn't believe in love at first sight. Until by chance, he saw Wang Ming's high-spirited look.</p>

    <p>At that moment, she decided that this was the person she was looking for...</p>

    <p>And this secret love experience is actually one of Zhai Yin's most precious secrets.</p>

    <p>She had previously told Wang Ming about exchanging secrets. This experience was the secret she was going to talk about.</p>

    <p>If she doesn't say it.</p>

    <p>Maybe Wang Ming will never know how long he has been liked by a female special forces soldier...</p>

    <p>"It seems like my words made Sister Yinzi think of a lot of things?" Sun Rong lay on the bed and smiled lazily.</p>

    <p>"Sister Yinzi, you have so much experience. I haven't thought of how to say it for a while." Zhai Yin also smiled and said: "But these days are very long. I have plenty of time to talk to you. But you have to keep this matter a secret for me. OK."</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded: "I like listening to stories the most!"</p>

    <p>"Okay. The essential oil is almost dry. My mouth is also dry. Wait for me to drink water. Come and help me." At this time, Zhai Yin gently patted the girl's slippery back and said.</p>

    <p>"No problem."Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>Then, she saw Zhai Yin take his own kettle, and then take a dropper. He slowly sucked a dropper of water from the kettle and dropped it on a piece of test paper.</p>

    <p>The water in the kettle is filled directly from the bathroom faucet by Zhai Yin. This is direct drinking water. In fact, it does not need to be filtered.</p>

    <p>However, for safety reasons, Zhai Yin still has to do a test by himself.</p>

    <p>It seems that this is also an occupational disease of special forces. They are very cautious in everything they do.</p>

    <p>"Sister Yinzi is so interesting."Sun Rong looked silly.</p>

    <p>"When you go out, safety comes first. You have to be careful about everything." Zhai Yin said.</p>

    <p>She looked at the test results of the test strips. She was relieved after it was confirmed to be safe and non-toxic.</p>

    <p>Before Sun Rong gave her an essential oil massage, Zhai Yin looked at her phone again and discovered the message posted by Yingxian Heming in the group chat.</p>

    <p>Then he said to Sun Rong: "It looks like I have to get up early tomorrow. There seems to be some activity."</p>

    <p>"What activity?"</p>

    <p>"The group said that we have to get up at three o'clock tomorrow and go to Tiangan Mountain to watch the sunrise. After having a meal on the top of the mountain, we will go to school to report. I heard that it was the kindness of the sixth lady."</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Six?"</p>

    <p>These words made Sun Rong feel a little more distracted.</p>

    <p>She immediately thought of the air crash that almost happened on the immortal boat. Her eyes showed more alertness.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why Mrs. Six would be murderous towards them.</p>

    <p>However, activities like mountain climbing are actually the most prone to accidents.</p>

    <p>What if this is a conspiracy planned in advance?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>However, as the number one Foundation Building on Earth. Sun Rong should not be afraid.</p>

    <p>I'm just curious. Why did the Sixth Mistress want to kill them twice? She tried to kill them twice...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, December 15th.</p>

    <p>In the early hours of the morning, in front of the door of Madam Six's mansion, a black shadow quietly emerged from an unknown position. It knelt down at the door and bowed its head.</p>

    <p>"Is it all cleaned up."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui's voice came. It had a frightening Queen's voice.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, madam. Everything has been taken care of."</p>

    <p>The black man muttered. He did not raise his head. He maintained his current posture: "The new maid has been brought. And this time, according to the lady's instructions, the team brought four people to serve the lady. They are all professionally trained. Thoughts A simple girl."</p>

    <p>"well done."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui nodded. His voice sounded particularly low: "The two girls who accompanied me to Tianxuan Temple today are both good children. It should be their honor to be chosen as a sacrifice."</p>

    <p>"Madam, you shouldn't tell me these things. I'm just following orders." The expression on the man in black's face was neither sad nor happy.</p>

    <p>"You are very dedicated." Jiugong Xinghui sneered.</p>

    <p>She adjusted the number of sacrifices in the new round to four. The main reason was because the ghost she raised was injured in this operation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, more sacrifices are needed as foster care to restore physical strength.</p>

    <p>All this was just as she expected. There must be a hidden master among the few people from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>"I have read the information of those people. I need you to investigate more carefully. What is the origin of that person named Wang Xiaoer." Jiugong Xinghui said.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>The man in black nodded.</p>

    <p>Then, his figure was like lightning, and he quickly turned into a thunder shadow and disappeared.</p>

    <p>After feeling the breath of the man in black completely disappear.</p>

    <p>In Madam Six's residence, Jiugong Xinghui had the following conversation with another unfamiliar voice.</p>

    <p>"Why do you doubt that person?"</p>

    <p>This voice was high-pitched and long. It was in sharp contrast to the sixth lady's voice. There was a sinister flavor in it.</p>

    <p>"It's said that he's the only one. He's the only one who doesn't send out any psychic waves. And the one who cut off the hair. It was him. If it was just an ordinary person. It's impossible to cut off hair with such power."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui smiled and said: "As for the remaining classmates Wang and Miss Sun, their strength is absolutely real. The eldest lady may be slightly stronger than the average Foundation Building period, but at most the combat power does not exceed the Golden Core."</p>

    <p>"So what are you going to do next?"</p>

    <p>"I organized a mountain climbing operation. At such a height, I can't survive on the Foundation Building alone... When the time comes, we will know after we push it down."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui's expression darkened, he smiled and said, "In such a critical moment, if any of the three of them hides their strength, they will definitely be exposed."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At three o'clock, the sky in Sun Island is still dark.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually didn't sleep at all. He just put his brain into sleep mode. Then he set a timer to turn on his computer.</p>

    <p>Once it reaches the point, his dead fish eyes will pop open automatically.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked over and took a look at Wang Ming's condition.</p>

    <p>He had already set a fixed alarm clock on his tablet.</p>

    <p>From three o'clock to three twenty, a total of 10 alarm clocks are set.</p>

    <p>Set one every minute...</p>

    <p>Judging from the general situation, if all the alarm clocks have not been sounded, they probably will not wake up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling squatted down and was thinking about shaking Wang Ming awake. But suddenly he heard Wang Ming murmuring: "Suppose... the parabola is on the y-axis... then we can get dy, xy, py..."</p>

    <p>Are you calculating in your dreams?</p>

    <p>For a moment. Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>Then about two minutes passed. When Wang Ming's second alarm clock rang.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the tablet computer suddenly sounded a warning sound.</p>

    <p>Then a series of dense data symbols quickly popped up and scrolled on the tablet.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Wang Ling had an ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>He could tell that the scrolling playback on the tablet looked like a smart hacking program.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took two steps back.</p>

    <p>Then there was only a "crash..." sound. The hotel's smoke alarm shower was activated directly. It poured directly on Wang Ming's face and body...</p>

    <p>"How come it's three o'clock so soon..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming rubbed his face, calmly got up from the bed, stretched, and then took off all his clothes in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Ling Ling, please go to the bathroom and bring me the body soap, shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrush. I just want to take a clear bath. Water resources are so precious. Don't waste them!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>As expected of you...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So... ten minutes later we gathered at the hotel door.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ming smelled of the fresh fragrance of having just taken a shower.</p>

    <p>"Since when have you become so clean-minded?" Zhai Yin felt a little unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Wang Ming would calculate some research formula. When he was completely immersed in it, he would forcibly hang himself up with pills. He would stay awake for days and nights. He didn't even have time to take a shower.</p>

    <p>"This is a wet alarm clock plug-in I designed before. I didn't expect it to work. Don't worry. I won't use it in the future."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. Then he whispered in Zhai Yin's ear: "From now on, Yinzi, you will help me wash it. Whether it is the big Wang Ming or the little Wang Ming, I will leave it to you."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin blushed immediately after hearing this: "Rogue..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong looked elsewhere in unison.</p>

    <p>Don't listen to anything inappropriate.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that sometimes having too strong hearing seems not a good thing.</p>

    <p>Not long after, Yingxian Heming appeared at the door. He came from his mansion: "Sorry. Everyone has been waiting for a long time. We will leave now."</p>

    <p>"Where is Teacher Huo Ding?"Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Huo Ding needs to handle the handover of Jiudaohe High School. So I can't participate in today's sunrise activity."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>"But please don't worry. I will follow you all the way. There will be no accidents. I grew up near Tiangan Mountain since I was a child. I am very familiar with it." Yingxian Heming said confidently.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the foot of Tiangan Mountain. The climbing process was not as tiring as Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>He followed the 60th team up for more than two thousand meters. He didn't feel anything at all.</p>

    <p>The main reason was that he also used the {Great Light Body Technique}, which caused him to lose weight drastically.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling even more insensitive.</p>

    <p>The key is. This light body technique. Wang Ling is not enough without it.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he would go mountain climbing with his quality.</p>

    <p>Every step up is like a landslide...</p>

    <p>However, we have only reached one-third of Tiangan Mountain.</p>

    <p>On Tiangan Mountain, there are small rest stops every few hundred meters.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was because he drank too much water. Yingxian Heming felt that he couldn't hold it in any longer: "I'm sorry, classmates. Wait for me here for a moment. Don't walk away. Don't go to dangerous places without authorization. I'll go get it." Just come back to the toilet."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put his pants in his pockets. He came to the fence a few meters in front of the rest stop and stared at the scenery below.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is Wang Ling's deliberate seduction.</p>

    <p>Because before he went up the mountain, he had a premonition that someone was following them with ill intentions.</p>

    <p>"Are you coming..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling thought. Then he felt a strong push coming from his back.</p>

    <p>The whole person rolled down the cliff...</p>
