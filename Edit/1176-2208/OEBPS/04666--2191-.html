  <h1>Chapter 2191 Sweet misunderstanding</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! Wang Ling just wanted to cross the river to the south bank with Sun Rong. Find Lao Huang's home quickly. Even Wang Ling didn't expect that there would be something along the way. There are many troubles.</p>

    <p>During the process of crossing the river, he had asked Jingke to use as much strength as possible. Don't use too much force. Don't attract too much attention... As a result, the surf was still vigorous.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this is not his fault.</p>

    <p>It's entirely Jingke's fault.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he and Sun Rong both wore helmets. Wang Ling also added a layer of restrictions outside the helmet to prevent anyone from seeing his and Sun Rong's faces through video analysis.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if he is photographed, he will not be traced.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling also has double insurance.</p>

    <p>Because this helmet has the logo of the Cultivation Inspection Department printed on it...</p>

    <p>In other words, if there is any emergency, he can immediately put the blame on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But that doesn't mean it's foolproof.</p>

    <p>Although the process of crossing the river was fast, Wang Ling still noticed the construction site on the south bank.</p>

    <p>He made too much noise. It may have caused trouble to the workers who were working hard to build the country of Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>I was thinking about whether to apologize or something.</p>

    <p>As a result, he saw two octopus men wearing human skin masks walking towards him.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling... Isn't this an Earth monk?" Sun Rong was keenly aware of this. He hid behind Wang Ling and asked quietly.</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of acclimatization. The way these octopus people walk is very strange!</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong is correct.</p>

    <p>These octopus men walk with the same hands and feet!</p>

    <p>It seems that they are humanoid creatures, right? Could it be that they have just evolved limbs and have not yet tamed them. Is that why they walk so strangely?</p>

    <p>Wang Tong is here.</p>

    <p>Any disguise is invalid for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But even so. Wang Ling has to praise them. The painted skin masks of these octopus men are very realistic.</p>

    <p>The details of the skin on it are very good. It can deflect many identification magic weapons. It can even fish in troubled waters under the eyes of high-level monks.</p>

    <p>Since the earth was upgraded, it has officially established diplomatic relations with aliens in major galaxies outside the universe. Now on earth, under the leadership of the alien ambassador Guo Ping, a complete database of aliens who have established diplomatic relations has been established.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling previously used it to import a piece of data into my mind.</p>

    <p>After discovering the true identities of these octopus people, he immediately compared it with the database in his mind. As a result, he found that there was no information about these octopus people in the database.</p>

    <p>Is it because it hasn't been entered into the system yet?</p>

    <p>The alien database is updating information every moment. Wang Ling is not sure whether the octopus man in front of him has been missed. After all, now</p>

    <p>Now every word and deed of the Earth monks represents the influence of the Earth in the universe. Wang Ling still pays great attention to the influence. Therefore, all circumstances will be taken into consideration.</p>

    <p>What if I wrongly accuse these aliens?</p>

    <p>And he didn't want to directly read the hearts of these octopus people.</p>

    <p>As a civilized, well-educated monk who has received nine years of compulsory education, Wang Ling feels that he must always regulate himself in accordance with Number 60 High School's standardized behavioral regulations and strict guidelines for dealing with others.</p>

    <p>So, facing these octopus men, he directly stretched out his hand.</p>

    <p>I wanted to shake hands with these octopus people first to show friendship. However, this action seemed to unexpectedly trigger a stress response in these octopus people.</p>

    <p>"He's going to take action! This human monk is going to take action!"</p>

    <p>The two octopus men in the lead obviously didn't have a very good psychological quality. One of the octopus men shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>Immediately from the shed behind him, more octopus men poured out carrying the tools in their hands.</p>

    <p>They were originally a group of aliens working secretly. Every movement of Wang Ling looked so hostile in their eyes. They reacted quickly and incomprehensibly like frightened birds.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for an enemy attack!</p>

    <p>Why is there such a big commotion?</p>

    <p>Straight across the river for surfing?</p>

    <p>This is obviously telling them that they are here to capture people!</p>

    <p>In addition, the octopus man saw that the helmets of Wang Ling and Sun Rong actually had the logo of the Cultivation Inspection Department... Although they had just arrived on Earth not long ago, they still had a strong understanding of the basic organizational structure of the Earth. Some understanding.</p>

    <p>In Songhai City, isn't the most famous one the Cultivation Inspection Department, which gave birth to the city hero Zhuo Yi?</p>

    <p>Good guy.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, they were all in the finishing stage. These two members of the Cultivation Inspection Department wearing helmets and plainclothes came to the door!</p>

    <p>The octopus man was anxious.</p>

    <p>It has reached the juncture of customer acceptance. As long as they receive the final remittance, they can purchase the materials to repair the spacecraft and leave the earth. Therefore, there is no way they can stop here!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling... How do I feel? They seem to have some misunderstanding about us?"Sun Rong feels like there is some misunderstanding here.</p>

    <p>But everything seems to be too late...</p>

    <p>A dozen octopus men were holding various tools. Big hammers, axes, hoes... came from all sides. Wang Ling. Sun Rong were surrounded.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere in front of him suddenly became tense. Wang Ling carefully protected Sun Rong behind him. At the same time, he used sharp dynamic vision to carefully analyze the movements of each octopus man.</p>

    <p>Although they have weapons, Wang Ling does not have any fear.</p>

    <p>After all. Physical attacks are ineffective against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He comes with anti-armor. The harder you hit him, the better the anti-armor effect will be.</p>

    <p>It's just like Sun Rong said now. Everything is not clear yet. Maybe there are some misunderstandings that have not been clarified. Wang Ling can't just watch these octopus people hit themselves. Then He was injured so much that there was nothing left...</p>

    <p>Therefore, as a kind-hearted young man, Wang Ling still sighed at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>He gently tapped a finger on Sun Rong's forehead. A circle of ripples was immediately released from Sun Rong's body. It spread in all directions with Sun Rong as the center.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ling using Sun Rong's body to act as a transformer. Through a small amount of spiritual pressure output, and through the Wang Ling who has successfully united the human sword and received the consecration from the monk Jin Deng. The body of id_00003}} is released by Sun Rong to produce a spiritual suppression effect on the surrounding octopus people.</p>

    <p>The strength. It should be just right. Never too light. But not heavy either.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sun Rong was touched by Wang Ling's finger on the forehead, causing his face to turn red.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's mentality was a bit broken. She didn't expect that at this critical moment, Wang Ling would actually reach out and tap her forehead. This action was a little ambiguous. It immediately made her unable to stop.</p>

    <p>What on earth is this piece of wood doing to her...</p>
