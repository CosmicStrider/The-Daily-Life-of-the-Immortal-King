  <h1>Chapter 1897: Defeat Jing Ze</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment Leng Ming and Wang Nuan arrived one after another, Jingze cursed loudly in his heart, because in just a few minutes, the outer wall of his core world had been breached one after another.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the Eternal Moon Starlight, which has a certain repairing and self-healing effect, now the outer wall of his core world would have been broken into a sieve. Holes everywhere.</p>

    <p>"Ya!" Wang Nuan appeared. The small body contained huge spiritual energy. Jingze was shocked. It was not that he and Bai Zhe had forgotten this. They had long been afraid of the little girl. They have seen it before. It's just because this girl is too young. The two of them think that they can handle it even if Wang Nuan takes action.</p>

    <p>But now Bai Zhe and Jingze have discovered it. They still underestimated this little girl's growth ability. This terrifying little girl's aura is too strong! She is less than half a year old, but she is like a wild beast! Every day, her body is full of energy. Earth-shaking changes...</p>

    <p>If this grows up, then what's the point?</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Bai Zhe secretly gave birth to another illusion. Even though Wang Ling was now designed by him to live in the eternal world, this fear of being dominated by the Old Wang family came up again.</p>

    <p>But he was unwilling to admit this to death. He believed that the person he was facing was just a baby and had nothing to be afraid of. He immediately ordered Jingze: "Seize Wang Muyu and kill her!"</p>

    <p>Seeing a small baby's body blocking another small body, he spoke angrily and without any courtesy, directly issued a death order to Jingze.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan is too strong. Killing her before she has fully grown up is the most logical course of action.</p>

    <p>Just as he spoke, Jingze took action again. The arrow in his hand turned into an astonishing electric dragon like thunder. It flew towards Wang Nuan with a radius as wide as a hill.</p>

    <p>However, all their attention was focused on Wang Nuan. They ignored the green grass that arrived at the same time as Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>During the continuous training in the Sword King Realm, Leng Ming became stronger. His body was stronger than before. He jumped in the void like an elf. He faced Jingze without fear.</p>

    <p>A piece of grass can cut down the sun, moon and stars. Now Leng Ming can definitely do this. And what is even more surprising to Jingze is that as a powerful piece of grass! Leng Ming is naturally not afraid of thunder and lightning!</p>

    <p>He went directly towards the electric dragon. The emerald green sword light burst out from below. It was like an arctic meteor transformed into a huge grass dragon and collided with the electric dragon. Then he directly hit the entire electric dragon with its arrows. Completely swallowed inside.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's strength was once again beyond Jingze's understanding. He had seen this piece of grass before, but it was far less troublesome than it was now.</p>

    <p>In addition, Leng Ming's natural restraint ability made Jingze feel a little at a loss for a while. He knew very well how the five elements restrained each other. He tried to use thunder and lightning to detonate the divine fire to burn Leng Ming. Unexpectedly, Leng Ming was not even afraid of fire. His whole body was on fire. Leng Ming instead exploded with stronger fighting power.</p>

    <p>He continued to display his exquisite body skills in strange arcs in the void. At the end, the sky fire came! It turned into a rain of fire from the sky and fell down.</p>

    <p>Seeing the divine fire coming, Jingze's expression finally became a little panicked. He originally thought that according to the five elements of restraint, Leng Ming would be extremely afraid of flames. But he didn't expect that the spiritual sword turned into a small piece of grass could actually overcome such a weakness. Instead, Use the divine fire burning in your body for his own use.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth and had no choice but to return the bow and arrow in his hand to the form of the black umbrella again to block the shower of divine fire in front of him. The form changes of the black umbrella are time-limited. Each transformation requires a period of time. This also means that Jingze will no longer be able to use that tricky bow and arrow for a while.</p>

    <p>The goal was achieved. Leng Ming landed on the ground and took root directly under the ground. He watched calmly as the divine fire burned his body.</p>

    <p>Is this suicide?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>In the distance, Jingze squinted his eyes. He found that the land where Leng Ming was was burned bare. However, at this time, a gust of wind roared past. The green grass on the ground sprouted again.</p>

    <p>This is the method of rebirth when the spring breeze blows.</p>

    <p>The unique skill that Leng Ming learned from the Sword King Realm. As long as there is land, he is not afraid of any flames. Although the flames do restrain him, including when the divine fire burned on his body just now, the heartbreaking pain is still there. He has cultivated to a level where he can face all this calmly.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jingze felt that he was a little overwhelmed. He couldn't even break through a sword spirit, let alone deal with the baby behind him.</p>

    <p>With Leng Ming helping to cover him, Wang Nuan had already initially taken care of Wang Muyu's injuries. At this time, Wang Muyu surprisingly discovered that his Aunt Nuan's diaper was not a simple diaper. It was simply a mobile method. There is a treasure house. There are all kinds of things in it. She took out various bottles and jars of wound medicine. Without saying anything, she opened the cap of the bottle and poured it into Wang Muyu's mouth.</p>

    <p>These bottles and jars are all elixirs that Wang Ling refines in his free time. Almost all of them taste like dry noodles. Wang Muyu felt a familiar feeling as soon as he took them into his mouth.</p>

    <p>As a dragonborn composed of ten thousand dragon genes, Wang Muyu's biggest advantage is that he has a very strong physical fitness. No matter how many tonics he takes, he will not die.</p>

    <p>Based on this situation, Wang Nuan did not consider the efficacy of the medicine at all. She directly rode on Wang Muyu and fed cans into his mouth.</p>

    <p>This is definitely the most powerful feed in history!</p>

    <p>After all, these elixirs are made by Wang Ling. The efficacy alone is several dimensions stronger than ordinary elixirs.</p>

    <p>So when the power of these tonics collided in Wang Muyu's body, he could feel as if a grand fireworks party was going on inside his body.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that the arrow wounds caused by Jingze previously healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. Wang Muyu even vaguely felt that he was about to break through.</p>

    <p>After pouring the last bottle of elixir, Wang Nuan thought that her preliminary work had been completed. She flew down from Wang Muyu's body, stood upright on her feet, suspended in the void, and stared at Jingze in the void.</p>

    <p>It was a gaze from the Lord of Shadow. It made Jingze feel a little scared.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Nuan had decided to take matters into her own hands. She called Leng Ming to her side with a wave of her hand. Then she climbed onto Leng Ming's solid shoulders and commanded her sword spirit directly as a mount.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's little face was full of care and favor. He completely obeyed Wang Nuan's instructions and completely handed over the command to Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>This was also a disguised fusion of man and sword. It gave Jingze an ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, Wang Nuan took action. She was riding on Leng Ming's shoulders. The two figures arrived almost instantly. They were so fast that Jingze could not react.</p>

    <p>A small slap came forward. It landed accurately on the right side of Jingze's face. The slap caused his teeth to crack instantly...</p>
