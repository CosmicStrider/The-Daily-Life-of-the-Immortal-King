  <h1>Chapter 1210 I admit that I am gambling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As a master of the perception system, Nan Yixiu's perception ability is indeed impeccable. Remote monitoring, range perception, insight into weaknesses, reasoning and positioning... these are all elements of an excellent perception system cultivator. He can represent He came from Nanhai Tianzhong to participate in the national competition as the captain. Naturally, he has two brushes with him.</p>

    <p>"Nan Yixiu's results in Nanhai Tianzhong are very good." Mr. Huang glanced at the detailed information handed over by President Qi. Comparing Wang Ling, almost every item was average. Nan Yixiu's results In this information, almost all subjects taken in Nanhai Tianzhong exams are S level. Some even got SSS.</p>

    <p>However, the results of external examinations are not that good. For example, in physical arts and sword control, Nan Yixiu only got an A grade. Compared with Nan Yixiu's other subjects, this result clearly shows a weakness.</p>

    <p>Mr. Huang understands very well.</p>

    <p>Nanhai Tianzhong is originally a cultivation academy that cultivates cultivators of the perception department. It is normal for the emphasis to be different.</p>

    <p>In recent years, the employment prospects for cultivators in the perception department have also been great.</p>

    <p>Not only are the wages high and the benefits good, but there is basically no need to do front-line or publicity work.</p>

    <p>Many parents send their children to study in the Cultivation Academy of the Department of Perception. In fact, a large part of it is based on safety.</p>

    <p>For a perceptual cultivator.</p>

    <p>The requirements for physical skills and swordsmanship don't have to be too strict. Just be enough.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoye has found a good student." Mr. Huang couldn't help but say after reading Nan Yixiu's information.</p>

    <p>"Principal Ye has been looking for his close disciples for so many years. This Nan Yixiu is indeed a rare talent in the perception department. He has mastered the final stage of {Natural Studies} at a young age. His merits are about to be fulfilled. His future is immeasurable. "President Qi nodded and agreed.</p>

    <p>{Natural Science} is the basic mental method written by Ye Feng, the principal of Nanhai Tianzhong, for all students in the school after he took office. It is divided into 80%. Nan Yixiu reached the seventh level in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>This speed of comprehension is much better than that of Principal Ye Feng back then.</p>

    <p>"Haha. It seems that Xiaoye has indeed found the treasure." Mr. Huang said with a smile.</p>

    <p>{Natural Science} is the basic heart sutra of the higher-level perception technique {Tao Follows Nature}. And the ability of {Tao Follows Nature} is Principal Ye Feng's famous secret skill. For so many years, Ye Feng has been looking for someone who can inherit his mantle. people.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Nam Il-soo is definitely qualified to take up the big position.</p>

    <p>But then again.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu's advantages are outstanding, but its shortcomings are also obvious.</p>

    <p>If such results are matched against Sun Rong and Yi Zhiyang, I am afraid that I will be beaten directly and doubt my life.</p>

    <p>But facing Wang Ling, who has almost all grades of B... it always gives people the illusion that everything is "stable."</p>

    <p>However, those who know Wang Ling also know very well that there are too many uncertainties about this Number 60 High School mascot.</p>

    <p>In the match between the two, although Nam Il-soo has a greater chance of winning, there is no guarantee that something will happen.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, who do you think will win? In the match between Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong just now, only one person answered correctly." At this time, President Qi turned around and looked at the principals behind him.</p>

    <p>"Someone guessed the draw correctly? Who was it?" Many principals glanced back and forth.</p>

    <p>"The answer will not be announced for the time being. This person sent me a private message. After the competition ends, everyone will naturally know the answer." President Qi sold a jar.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Qingxi, who was in Fu Mo Number 1 High School, saw Chen Tianxiang sitting next to him. He saw a sly smile on the corner of this man's mouth.</p>

    <p>It's true. It's this man...</p>

    <p>Although Fumo Number 1 High School was unexpectedly eliminated this time, Li Qingxi always believed that his strategic plan for Number 60 High School was correct.</p>

    <p>He knows Chen Tianxiang very well. This man's calculations are still as good as before. Especially after taking over Number 60 High School. Compared with previous years, the overall level of Number 60 High School has improved significantly, almost like a jumping machine.</p>

    <p>If nothing else happens, Li Qingxi feels that after this national competition, Number 60 High School will soon be upgraded to a city key...</p>

    <p>As the vast majority of principals failed in the last quiz.</p>

    <p>Regarding the result of this game, many principals not only did not restrain themselves, but also showed an attitude of disbelief. "I don't believe it. This game... Can Nan Yixiu lose? I bet that Nan Yixiu wins!"</p>

    <p>"I'll bet on Nan Yixiu too!"</p>

    <p>"If Number 60 High School wins, I will donate money to Number 60 for campus construction!"</p>

    <p>"You donate money? Donating money is very vulgar. I will donate the spirit gathering array!"</p>

    <p>"If I win, I'll donate the playground!"</p>

    <p>"I donate to the canteen!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, all the principals have expressed their opinions. Many principals know that Number 60 High School is about to be renovated. I am here to boast.</p>

    <p>However, there are still some principals who are afraid to express their opinions.</p>

    <p>Principal Chen, who now takes over Number 60 High School, is a master of planning. Who knows if this person has any backup plans for his students?</p>

    <p>Actually, there really is...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carries a tip bag given by Principal Chen. This was stuffed into Sun Rong's hand before the game.</p>

    <p>There is a complete strategy for dealing with Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>He wanted to imitate the fight between Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong and end up in a draw with Nan Yixiu. In this way, he could escape unscathed and not be too noticeable.</p>

    <p>However, as more and more principals publicly stated that they would be fine as long as their side wins...Wang Ling suddenly had the idea of winning.</p>

    <p>Winning. They can have multiple canteens at Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>And what does multiple kiosks mean?</p>

    <p>It means he can buy more dry noodles!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Wang Ling felt like he couldn't calm down... and as long as Principal Chen's tips were there, even if he won in the end, he could still put the blame on Principal Chen.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Are you ready to take the call?" At this time, Nan Yixiu stepped forward and reminded with a smile.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was very relaxed. He looked like he could take down Wang Ling in just 3 rounds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Without saying a word, he took out the tip bag given by Principal Chen directly from the pocket of his school uniform.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Nan Yixiu suddenly panicked. His principal had already told him that Principal Chen of Number 60 High School was very scheming. He might send "Chen Zi Tips" to the students in his school. Now this tip is The moment the bag was taken out of Wang Ling's trouser pocket,</p>

    <p>All the principals showed surprised expressions. They all looked at someone who was calm and composed in the field. They almost said in unison: Chen Tianxiang. Is this also part of your plan?</p>

    <p>No one knows what is written in the bag. But it is obvious that this must be the magic weapon to defeat Minami Il-Soo!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was about to take apart the kit. Nan Yixiu on the other side took action almost instantly. He roared and rushed towards Wang Ling. He almost used up his maximum speed: "Wang Ling. There's no way I'm going to let you succeed!"</p>

    <p>Now he can still defeat Wang Ling. If Wang Ling sees the contents of the kit, the outcome of the battle will be difficult to predict!</p>

    <p>Therefore, Nan Yixiu's first judgment is that he must grab the tip first!</p>

    <p>At the speed of lightning, Nan Yixiu quickly moved in front of Wang Ling. He pulled the kit over and firmly held it in his palm. Then he quickly pulled away from Wang Ling several times. position. To prevent Wang Ling from competing with him.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Your last life-saving charm has been taken away by me. What are you going to do with me?" Nan Yixiu sneered while holding the bag of tips.</p>

    <p>Command Center. When Principal Ye saw this scene, his heart felt cold.</p>

    <p>"Damn it! I fell into a trap!"</p>

    <p>With the layout of Number 60 High School, how could he let the tips easily fall into the hands of others?</p>

    <p>At this time, Nan Yixiu opened the bag of tips. A countdown of explosion characters came into his eyes.</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more...</p>

    <p>Boom! A sound!</p>

    <p>As Nan Yixiu's golden protective talisman was triggered, a huge mushroom cloud rose from the scene.</p>

    <p>Command Center. Everyone turned their attention to Principal Chen. Now the principals present finally understood why this person had a sly smile on his face from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>"Chen Tianxiang. You are so despicable!" Principal Ye stood up and scolded.</p>

    <p>"I think it's fair. If Nan Yixiu hadn't snatched Wang Ling's bag just now, Wang Ling would have been eliminated. It's because you were too suspicious."</p>

    <p>"you..."</p>

    <p>"I admit that I am gambling. But one of Nan Yixiu and Wang Ling must die." Principal Chen smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>The results are obvious.</p>

    <p>He.</p>

    <p>The bet was won.</p>
