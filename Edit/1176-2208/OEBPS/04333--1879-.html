  <h1>Chapter 1879 The long-planned usurper</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facing the female version of Wang Zhen with a dumpling in front of her, Liu Qingyi's expression was extremely complicated. Although having a child was among her follow-up plans after falling in love with Wang Zhen, she didn't expect that it would come so far in advance!</p>

    <p>And the person who is pregnant is not her. It is Wang Zhen himself!</p>

    <p>"The key point now is to find a way to go back... otherwise I will really have to give birth if I stay here for eternity and delay it forever." Wang Zhen said in a dumbfounded voice. He took a few breaths and stabilized the fetal movement. But the mask of pain on his face is still very obvious.</p>

    <p>He had a premonition that something would happen to the child in the near future. If that happens, this is no joke... He, as a man, must really experience the pain of childbirth. This is something Wang Zhen cannot imagine.</p>

    <p>According to the original diary track, as long as the gathering of the Four Emperors can be successfully completed, then they can directly return to the modern world.</p>

    <p>But now the diary trajectory has been disrupted. In other words, the ending of the original meeting of the Four Emperors will also change as a result. It will even lead to many other complicated trajectories.</p>

    <p>By then, even if the gathering of the Four Emperors can be held smoothly, it will still be a question whether they can go back after completing their mission.</p>

    <p>These days, it is precisely because of the child in his belly that Wang Zhen is almost entirely focused on it and has no time to take care of other things.</p>

    <p>No matter how beautiful this Holy Stone Sect saint is, Wang Zhen has no intention of admiring her, let alone having any obscene thoughts about this body.</p>

    <p>Of course, this is also thanks to Liu Qingyi's strict discipline in the past. Although the young couple have passed through the bodies of different people, they still understand each other's personalities very well.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Liu Qingyi has full trust in Wang Zhen. She feels that Wang Zhen will never do anything wrong to her.</p>

    <p>"Hey. That's great." This made Sun Rong feel envious. Although Sun Rong also knew it clearly in her heart. It seems that now is not the time to envy others.</p>

    <p>These two snake girls were just as Wang Ling expected. They were from their side. And they all came from time-travel time.</p>

    <p>As Snake Girl Number 1, Liu Qingyi had already revealed her identity. At this time, Snake Girl Number 2 suddenly laughed and looked at Sun Rong: "Since you have guessed Sister Qingyi's identity, then you can guess mine. What's my identity?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled and replied: "You are Taoist Master You Yueqing, right?"</p>

    <p>Seeing that her identity was revealed, You Yueqing showed a self-seeking expression on her face: "Hey, I have only known you for a short time. How come you know me so well? You can guess me right away."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled: "Daoist You has an elegant temperament. Even if she enters the body of this snake girl, this aspect will not change easily, right? Of course, the most important point is... Daoist You, can you put down the feather duster..."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing smiled awkwardly. Unexpectedly, the feather duster on her hand betrayed her.</p>

    <p>She actually has the habit of shaking off floating dust when thinking about things. This can be regarded as an occupational disease that she has developed as a Taoist monk for many years.</p>

    <p>However, in order to prevent the identity of the snake girl she played from being exposed, she had to endure it these days. But now that the trajectory of the script is completely messy, she can free her nature.</p>

    <p>But she couldn't find suitable dust for the time being, so she could only use a feather duster found in a restaurant instead.</p>

    <p>It was this habitual action that made Sun Rong notice the clues.</p>

    <p>Immediately, Wang Ying used sound transmission to quickly summarize the current situation to Liu Qingyi and You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone fell into deep thinking again.</p>

    <p>Back to the subject. At this time, Emperor Dongda sighed: "I didn't expect things to turn out like this. According to the previous script, King Tiankun will not be beaten to death by me."</p>

    <p>"This is obviously a third party involved."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi analyzed. Looking at this, Dongda said: "And I think. If you really have nothing to hide from us, senior, there is only one situation left."</p>

    <p>"Now that things have happened, I really have nothing to hide. Senior Wang is in my body. He has witnessed everything. I still expect Senior Wang to steal the show for me at the gathering of the Four Emperors. Who would have thought that this would happen? Such a thing." Dongda was very anxious. It seemed that he really had nothing to hide.</p>

    <p>"Then this is actually very obvious. There is a third party who also knows about this diary and intends to deliberately destroy the trajectory of the diary to achieve his or her own ulterior motives."</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi stared straight at Emperor Dongda and said: "Senior, let me ask you again. Are you sure that you are not lying? Do you really know nothing about these mysterious seniors?"</p>

    <p>Looking at Dongda with such eyes, he felt a little angry. She was obviously a girl whose realm was much weaker than his own. But for some reason, Dongda felt that he seemed to be shorter than Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>This is a powerful eye interrogation technique. Wang Zhen is the most knowledgeable about this.</p>

    <p>Ever since Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi became romantically involved, Liu Qingyi had been extremely strict with Wang Zhen's interactions with other members of the opposite sex. She would often interrogate him with this kind of glare.</p>

    <p>So under Liu Qingyi's eyes, lying is useless. Liu Qingyi can keenly catch anything that is a little bit wrong.</p>

    <p>So. After Liu Qingyi stared at Emperor Dongda's eyes for a few minutes, she suddenly withdrew her gaze and touched her chin in confusion: "eh... From what I observed, Emperor Dongda did not lie. He really knows nothing about the unexpected situation that is happening now and the matter of this mysterious senior."</p>

    <p>"So first we have to figure out what this third party is planning to do by disrupting the original trajectory of the diary." At this time, Wang Ying's voice came.</p>

    <p>He used Emperor Dongda's body to snap his fingers. A circle of light suddenly appeared in the void in front of him. What was reflected in it was the scene of Zhang Zhui and Mrs. Shanxiu talking in another room.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui and Mrs. Shanxiu, after testing each other like playing Tai Chi for a while, happened to ask about the key topic about the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>"Madam said earlier that as a reward for my master. Her Ladyship would reveal a secret about the Book of the Nine Realms. I wonder if it's true?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>"This madam's words are naturally true." Mrs. Shanxiu smiled kindly, and said that she gave a wink to Sun Fu on the side: "Fu, take out the things."</p>

    <p>"Yes, madam." Sun Fu nodded obediently. Then she took out a familiar scroll from a storage ring.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui and everyone in the other room were stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>"As you can see."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu narrowed her eyes and said mysteriously: "This is another book. The Book of Nine Realms. And it is indeed an authentic book written by Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>"Then the one we got..."</p>

    <p>"That is also an authentic work." Mrs. Shanxiu said: "There were originally two books of the Book of Nine Realms. One is a yang scroll, and the other is a yin scroll..."</p>
