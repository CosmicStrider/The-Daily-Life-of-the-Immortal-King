  <h1>Chapter 1751 The "scapegoat" of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even the Tengu would not have thought that they were being monitored by the "back door" left by Shou Chong at that time. And they could clearly identify the personnel of their Duobao City underground intelligence team.</p>

    <p>"The biggest leader of Duobao City's underground intelligence trading network is called Tengu. He is a wanted criminal in many countries. He is very cunning. He always wears a Jason mask. But usually the person caught is not Tengu himself." Shou Chong explained to Martial Saint Jiang.</p>

    <p>"What does this mean?" Martial Saint frowned.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei continued Shou Chong's words and explained: "Based on the evidence currently in the police's possession, Tengu represents more than one person. The true identity of this leader is a coalition of many elites. Therefore, in past operations, the police captured It doesn't help to kill one. Intelligence operations continue to be carried out."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong nodded: "Zhenjun is right! In fact, this time for the underground intelligence network, the Municipal Bureau of Xiuzhen Police Department has already united with the multi-national investigation team against Tengu. They have been secretly monitoring for many days, but they have not found a suitable opportunity. Take action. I'm afraid that if I take action, I'll alert the enemy."</p>

    <p>"So. How many countries' investigation teams are coming to investigate this matter?" Martial Saint Jiang asked.</p>

    <p>"In the currently reported list of joint investigation teams, there are a total of investigation teams from nine countries cooperating with us in the investigation."</p>

    <p>"Ten countries... It seems that the Tengu has offended many people."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Lord Martial Saint." Shou Chong said: "And many investigation teams are appointed by the heads of various cultivation countries. They are required to catch all the Tengu."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Shou Chong, who appeared in the avatar on the tablet, suddenly frowned: "But...because the Tengu can escape in every action. At present, in our Huaxiu police, there are doubts about the true purpose of the foreign joint investigation team."</p>

    <p>"You mean. In the joint investigation team, there might be Tengu people?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Lord Martial Saint. But this is just a little suspicion."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said: "So for this operation to save classmate Jiang, I personally suggest that it is best to take private action. Do not use the relationship between the Office of Strategic Deception and the police. This way, it will not disturb the investigation team and the Tengu team. If these people are secretly rescued by their classmates, the tengu will be left dumb eating coptis."</p>

    <p>"Got it."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang nodded: "So. I have one last question."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "Martial Saint, please speak."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang: "You said before that what these people really want to capture is Miss Rongrong. What I want to know is. Why do they want to capture her?"</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>This question suddenly made Shou Chong fall into silence.</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang frowned: "What's going on? Hesitating. Sun Yiyuan and I are also acquaintances. Don't worry. No matter what the reason is, I will definitely not blame him. This is something that can't be helped. It was an accident. No one can I don't want to see it."</p>

    <p>The scene was quiet for several minutes. Finally, Lord Diulei spoke first: "That's it. Lord Martial Saint..."</p>

    <p>He knew. There had to be an explanation.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Martial Saint will never give up.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is taking care of a baby these days...but that little one actually has nothing to do with Mr. Sun's family. He is just the younger brother of one of Miss Rong's classmates."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned. But he decided to explain according to the prepared words: "The result was unimaginable. This child was misunderstood by the intelligence dealer as being born to Miss Sun. So..."</p>

    <p>"That's why the Tengu people had a bad idea. They planned to kidnap Rongrong and use it to coerce information and extort money."</p>

    <p>To Lord Diulei's surprise, Martial Saint Jiang seemed to have known about this matter early on.</p>

    <p>After hearing the previous statement, he curled up his lips and couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Actually, I already know these things Zhenjun said."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei suddenly understood: "So this is... a test?"</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception is getting bigger and bigger now. Head of State is always a little worried."</p>

    <p>"Sometimes testing is necessary." As he spoke, Martial Saint Jiang stood up and faced the video camera: "I am glad that you have spoken truthfully with me about these matters. Then there is no need for you to intervene in the next matter. Utilizing the resources of the Office of Strategic Deception is indeed a bit of a big deal. So I've decided to do it myself..."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint finished speaking and immediately interrupted the link.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei originally wanted to call him out, but was a step too late.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "What happened to Zhenjun?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't laugh or cry: "I was going to say to Martial Saint that there are now people who have gone to attend to the Jiang girl... and they are all private operations."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "Already deployed?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shrugged helplessly: "You know. I am just a unit of measurement of combat power. They never listen to my orders."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "If Martial Saint were to pass by now, I'm afraid we could make up a table of mahjong... Only in this operation, Miss Rong is also there... I'm really worried that if Miss Rong's strength were to be exposed in front of the ten generals, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to tell the truth."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Just like Lord Diulei said. Sun Rong is already on the way to rescue Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know how many times I have rescued Jiang Yingying. But when this familiar scene happened again, even Sun Rong felt a sense of destiny tricking people.</p>

    <p>In the past, when her strength was not that strong, the competitors of the Huaguo Shuilian Group tried every means to hire people to abduct her and cause trouble for her. For example, the former Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>After she gained strength, this group of people would make mistakes when trying to catch anyone. Instead of looking for her, they would look for Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>So after a comprehensive comparison, Sun Rong surprisingly found that Jiang Liuyue's comprehensive business capabilities are stronger...at least. It won't mistake people.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. I don't quite understand why you want to save her? Don't you always hate that Jiang Yingying?" While riding the blue motorcycle transformed by Aohai on the Ring Expressway. Sun Rong suddenly heard Sun Ying'er's voice in her mind.</p>

    <p>"It's true that I hate her. Because she also likes Wang Ling. We are in a competitive relationship. But there is nothing wrong with liking someone. This is a normal thing."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "And she was taken away. It was also because the group of people mistakenly identified her as me. How could I just ignore her? If I leave her alone this time, I will feel that I don't care about her at all. I am not qualified to stand on the same platform as her and like Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"But what if your strength is exposed..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled: "I heard. Zhuo Yi Senior is also on the way."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>Good guys.</p>

    <p>Now, sharing the same pot?</p>
