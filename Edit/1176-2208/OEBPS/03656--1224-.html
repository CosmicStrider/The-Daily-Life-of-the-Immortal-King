  <h1>Chapter 1224 Why is Kuxuan so short?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this time, the International League of Cultivators SBP is holding a secret meeting. Seven groups of black figures appear at the meeting table. This is the messenger of SBP. They can make decisions together and formulate the organization's next action plan by voting.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the fairness of the vote, starting from the day the SBP organization was established, the identities of the seven people selected as emissaries by the alliance were concealed. None of them knew the identities of each other, thus eliminating the possibility of internal bribery.</p>

    <p>As a prestigious investigation organization affiliated with the Alliance, the coordinates of the Dark Ancestor Evil Three Smiles that shocked the world were calculated by these seven people.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that because of a major mistake, their final calculation was a little late and they failed to capture the Dark Ancestor alive.</p>

    <p>In the end, Xie Sanxiao died of pride and trust. He died because he could not withstand the spiritual energy poured into his body by the Tianmai Master Valve... And in order to preserve the reputation of the organization, the seven envoys of SBP finally agreed to launch a hero. And this The hero is the ancestor of Zhuo Yi: Zuo Butong. (For details, please review {Chapter 1105: Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao and Zuo Butong})</p>

    <p>"I, Judgment, invite you here this time to say something." Among the seven, the black shadow in the middle made a sharp and funny sound. Everyone's voices were processed, making it impossible to distinguish between men and women.</p>

    <p>Without knowing each other's names, they can only refer to each other by code names.</p>

    <p>The seats for each meeting are fixed. The person who speaks now and sits in seat 4. Calls himself the judge.</p>

    <p>"What happened?" The person in position 1 asked. His/her code name is Moon. It is a code name that looks very feminine. But this does not mean that the person in position 1 is a woman.</p>

    <p>"Keorn Duncan. has been discovered." The voice of the judge sounded extremely serious. All of a sudden, the scores in the field began to become tense.</p>

    <p>"Keorn was sent to the Huaxiu country 20 years ago. It has been flawless for many years. Why was he discovered?" Everyone was puzzled.</p>

    <p>In order to allow Keorn to integrate better there, they even cut off all contact with Keorn afterwards. They placed all their faith on Keorn, hoping that he could investigate the whole story and eventually return to the Foundation.</p>

    <p>"It's because of the Office of Strategic Deception," said Xingxing at position 2. No one knew exactly where "Xingxing" came from. However, this person was just like his codename. He seemed to have the prophetic ability of an astrologer. He often had the ability to see in his hands. Can get more information than others.</p>

    <p>"Yes." The judge nodded: "Originally, Keorn's method of pretending to be the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother, the ancestor of the killer world, to obtain funds was indeed impeccable. However, in a recent operation, he exposed himself. A man with strange resurrection appeared in Huaxiu country. The weirdo of magic. This man resurrected Evil Three Smiles..."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>At this time, Taiyang in position 3 sighed: "Back then, Keorn was only one step away from annihilating this Dark Ancestor man."</p>

    <p>"This matter. It must be our mistake. We did not consider such an unexpected situation. Keorn lost his mind. He stabbed the Dark Ancestor 862 times in one second, killing him on the spot." Number 4 The trial said: "He made up for the regrets of the past. But at the same time, he also exposed his whereabouts. This finally gave the Office of Strategic Deception an opportunity."</p>

    <p>The discussion ended at this point. At this moment, the black shadow at position 7 suddenly flickered. Then it disappeared on the spot.</p>

    <p>"The Fool. Are you leaving again?"</p>

    <p>"That's all. He does this every time."</p>

    <p>"The signal at home is not good?"</p>

    <p>"The devil knows what he is doing."</p>

    <p>Judgment was already used to seeing the Fool leave the table many times. Then Judgment turned his attention to the chariot in position 5 and the fate of position 6: "You two, do you have any ideas?"</p>

    <p>Chariot's voice was as steady and rough as the code name: "I'm not worried about Keorn leaking the secret at all. He has always been very strict with his mouth. And he doesn't have the guts to tell this secret. The seven of us have placed a seven-level forbidden curse on him. Once the forbidden curse is initiated, everyone in his family will be implicated. He should be very clear about the consequences of speaking out."</p>

    <p>Destiny remains silent. Although he/she is present, there is actually no difference between his/her presence and absence. However, Destiny never misses any meeting, and often mentions some important events at critical moments.</p>

    <p>The remaining people waited for a while. Seeing that Destiny still had no intention of speaking, the judge, as the host, cleared his throat and continued the discussion: "As Chariot said. I also believe that Keorn will not tell the story. We No one in the world can break the seven-fold forbidden spell that we jointly set. What happened 20 years ago was a decision we made. For the sake of the foundation... please also continue to stand firm."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Songhai City Number 1 Prison. Prison guards are on both sides. The security is extremely tight.</p>

    <p>This scale is no less than when the old devil was first imprisoned. In order to prevent unexpected situations from happening, Warden Liang arranged a matryoshka-like assembly outside. A total of no less than fifty patrol teams of 10 people were integrated to patrol around the prison.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei judged that Keorn has a big unknown secret.</p>

    <p>SBP placed multiple forbidden curses on this person. Once the secret is revealed, the whole family will be killed... This level of threat is often directly proportional to the importance of the secret behind it.</p>

    <p>20 years ago, Keorn had been lurking in the Huaxiu Kingdom to conduct secret investigations into something. The Foundation deliberately and deliberately secretly buried this person's purpose of going to the Huaxiu Country. It has to be doubtful.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Keorn. Even if you don't say anything now, we can still capture you for espionage and lock you up here for a hundred, two hundred years. With three of the most famous people in our prison... them Now there is a shortage of three. I have been looking for a long time, but I can't find the right person to imprison." Warden Liang used the microphone to talk to Keorn through the glass wall. He paid close attention to Keorn's expression and watched the other person's micro-expression.</p>

    <p>Inducing confessions is a set of rules that Warden Liang is very familiar with. However, in Keorn's case, this set of rules completely failed.</p>

    <p>He has received professional training from SBP and is of very high quality. Even after the forbidden curse has been removed, he still refuses to say anything. No matter what Warden Liang asks, there is no emotion or emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>Close the dialogue button. Warden Liang looked at Lord Diulei aside. He felt helpless: "What should I do? Zhenjun... Ordinary interrogation seems to be ineffective against him."</p>

    <p>"Everyone has the most fragile thing in their heart. No one is invulnerable."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the young man in front of him through the glass: "If he refuses to say, maybe we can start with him first. Does Warden Liang know where Keorn lived before?"</p>

    <p>"Still investigating. There is only a general scope." Warden Liang said.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Brother Dog happens to be here too. Let him track within the range. Keorn's residence should be found soon."</p>

    <p>The two hit it off immediately.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei is preparing to take Er Ha out to investigate.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, Warden Liang suddenly received an urgent report. A stream of light exploded in front of his eyes, forming a string of characters that greeted Warden Liang's eyes.</p>

    <p>This is news from within Songhai City's local Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen..." Warden Liang stared at the content above, his face full of disbelief.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"</p>

    <p>"The local Huaxiu Alliance in Songhai City asked us to release him."</p>

    <p>"Release... people?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Er Ha were stunned at the same time.</p>
