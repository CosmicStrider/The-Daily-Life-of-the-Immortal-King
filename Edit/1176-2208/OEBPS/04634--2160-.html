  <h1>Chapter 2160 Sword Fighting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Everyone in Sixiangzhong was puzzled by this situation. But everyone was shocked. Snow Tiger's blizzard was directly ignored. The boy not only happily built a thirty-meter-high mecha outside. He even sat on the mecha himself and composed the head himself!</p>

    <p>Is this an operation that normal carbon-based organisms can think of!</p>

    <p>Then a scene happened that shocked Xuehu, Zhu?, and Xiongwu.</p>

    <p>Because in the next second, above their heads, the boy sat on the snow-white mecha he made and began to perform a penetration performance. In an instant, the right hand of the snow-white mecha turned into a spiral and began to burrow into the ground.</p>

    <p>The ground shook.</p>

    <p>Inside the Sixiangzhong base, the ground on the ceiling began to collapse. Large swaths of wall dust shook off. There was a gesture of burying them.</p>

    <p>This boy is so terrifying. He is so strong that he doesn't look like a human being. The most important thing is that they have never seemed to realize that there is such a powerful person on the earth before.</p>

    <p>This is definitely a nightmare!</p>

    <p>How could it be a real person...</p>

    <p>When they were sixteen or seventeen years old, they were still playing in the mud!</p>

    <p>This boy is a high school student of sixteen or seventeen years old. He is already chasing some of their Itinerant Immortals and is starting to hammer him!</p>

    <p>"No. If this continues, the base will collapse!" Xiongwu opened his mouth. He signaled Xuehu to think of a solution quickly.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Snow Tiger pulled out the magic sword that had penetrated the wall in an extremely embarrassed manner. The blizzard on the island also stopped immediately.</p>

    <p>They thought that the Snow Mecha created by Wang Ling would also melt. But what they didn't know was that the Snow Mecha had already been subjected to the latest version of the Great Attunement 3.0 by Wang Ling. Even if the surrounding temperature Return to normal. It will not melt directly.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing we can do, brother. It's me!"</p>

    <p>In desperation, Zhu? finally decided to take action. He had a magic sword named Fire Joy. Any object cut by his sword energy would explode!</p>

    <p>So in this situation, he can no longer care about so many things. The only way Zhu Xi can think of is to use his magic sword's passive ability to cut this snow-white mecha and turn it into an explosive!</p>

    <p>"Sword fighting!"</p>

    <p>There are many spells for controlling spiritual swords remotely. As a sect famous for its swordsmanship, the disciples from the Four Elephants School are all top-notch in swordsmanship. In order to make his sword energy hit the target smoothly, Zhu? object.</p>

    <p>He has spent seven hundred years just practicing this sword fighting technique.</p>

    <p>The {sword fighting technique} that he has mastered for seven hundred years has doubled Zhu?s confidence at this moment. In an instant, a crimson sword energy spread out behind him. The fire filled the air. It was like the sacred bird Suzaku emitting brilliance that illuminated the entire underground. It's bright.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling's electric drill penetrated into the base of the island, a light fire was seen seeping out from below. It was a sword energy rising straight from the ground. It was emitting astonishing heat.</p>

    <p>If I had seen Wang Ling when he was one year old, I might have been shocked. But now he is no longer in trouble.</p>

    <p>On swordsmen with this type of flame. Wang Ling has seen the Dongda Emperor from the Eternal Period. He has the immortal Kongque King Ming Dharma. That kind of brilliance illuminated the entire Dongda Region back then. He himself was the one who shined in one place. sun.</p>

    <p>So compared with the Zhu? in front of me, it can only be regarded as a dwarf.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master, this is to use sword fighting skills to apply sword energy on your Snow Mecha." Jingke analyzed.</p>

    <p>He is the strongest sword spirit. He naturally has his own ability to distinguish various sword skills.</p>

    <p>Just when Zhu Xi was using his sword fighting skills to remotely control his fire joy, Jingke had already seen it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>My heart remains the same as before. There is no wave in the ancient well.</p>

    <p>"--Sword comes!"</p>

    <p>Below the base. Zhu? controlled the Joy of Fire. He planned to suddenly rush out from the underground gap to give Wang Ling a wave of surprises.</p>

    <p>As for the swordsmanship that seeks to survive in the cracks like this, Zhu Xi also gave it a very nice swordsmanship name.</p>

    <p>That is: between coming and going...</p>

    <p>He watched the fierce sword energy rushing out from the ground. He was guarding the gap. The moment he saw the magic sword just emerging like the tip of a bamboo shoot.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his sword fingers together. He pointed down lightly.</p>

    <p>The joy of fire that had just emerged immediately changed its direction and headed towards the owner below the ground.</p>

    <p>"Idiot! This is the wrong direction! It's not here! I'm your sword master! Don't come here!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In just a few dozen seconds, a big explosion occurred underground on the island.</p>

    <p>There was a movement like the eruption of an active volcano. Magma spurted out from the gaps and flowed around the island.</p>

    <p>The Sixiangzhong's base was directly blown up by Wang Ling... Oh no. To be more precise, it should be Zhu? He shot himself in the foot.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling can feel it. Except for Qingjiao and Zhu?, several people from the Four Elephants are seriously injured. Snow Tiger and Xiongwu are still alive.</p>

    <p>Their psychic signals are still there.</p>

    <p>He should have escaped early before the magic sword fell back and exploded.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. In the case of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Escape is ultimately useless.</p>

    <p>He locked onto the direction where Xiong Wu and Xue Hu used magic to escape. He remotely sensed the spiritual signal of the other party's escape from the island.</p>

    <p>Finally, he set his sights on the sea.</p>

    <p>It turns out that they used magic to blast through the rock wall below the base. Did they escape by diving into the seabed?</p>

    <p>To pull out two living people in a vast ocean is simply a fantasy.</p>

    <p>But if the opponent is Wang Ling., the outcome will be different.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling immersed himself entirely in the Snow Mecha and stood on the island. Directly facing Snow Tiger, the direction in which Xiongwu fled.</p>

    <p>They were diving fiercely at the bottom of the sea. Excessive panic caused their legs to swing very fast. Although they did not escape for a long time, they had already swam a long distance.</p>

    <p>This boy is so scary...</p>

    <p>They are not opponents.</p>

    <p>I can only think of running away hastily in this embarrassing way.</p>

    <p>They have swam very far.</p>

    <p>Moreover, there are many biological signals under the sea. It stands to reason that even if this young man is extremely capable, it would be difficult to track them, right?</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, Xuehu and Xiongwu didn't know what kind of player they were facing at this moment.</p>

    <p>The two people who were snorkeling soon discovered that something was wrong with the water around them...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>How could something be wrong with the sea water?</p>

    <p>"Brother, although... but... I just feel like we are swimming backwards..."</p>

    <p>Xuehu said in horror.</p>

    <p>This is definitely not an illusion.</p>

    <p>But it really happened!</p>

    <p>The flow direction of the sea water around us has changed!</p>

    <p>This surprised Xiong Wu extremely.</p>

    <p>At this time, the two of them looked back. They saw that the young man was controlling the Snow White Mecha and was already standing on the edge of the island waiting for them. Both of his excellent hands were inserted into the sea water.</p>

    <p>Snow Tiger and Xiong Wu were both shocked.</p>

    <p>They never thought that this young man would use his own power to change the direction of the ocean current...</p>

    <p>Of course, this scene was not the only thing that shocked them the most.</p>

    <p>Because in the next second, they felt that the sea water around them actually receded, directly revealing a passage. A wide seabed avenue was exposed...</p>

    <p>Damn!</p>

    <p>It's the dividing sea!</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu couldn't help but curse.</p>

    <p>Is this something that normal humans on earth can do?</p>
