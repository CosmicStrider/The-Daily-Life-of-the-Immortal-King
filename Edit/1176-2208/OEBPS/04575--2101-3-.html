  <h1>Chapter 2101 The 3rd Yuan Zun Order</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is "conquering strength with softness." It is another variation of the "drip of water penetrating stone" method in {Wuji Sword}.</p>

    <p>The vernacular is "rebound."</p>

    <p>The sword energy itself does not have lethality. It is more about integrating the Tao of Tai Chi.</p>

    <p>The sword energy is used to tamper with the surrounding airflow, thus causing the flying objects that collide with each other to change their original trajectories.</p>

    <p>This kind of swordsmanship can be used skillfully during Yi Jianchuan's True Immortal period. Now, he is naturally more skillful in using it.</p>

    <p>This is Michu shooting himself in the foot. The railgun has no radiation and will not have any impact on the monk's body. But if it is bombarded on the mainland, a mushroom cloud can still be grown. And at least it will not be affected by the railgun. In the city hit by the cannon, all psychic clay will be disintegrated in an instant.</p>

    <p>The use of psychic clay in modern technology is very complex. It is not just used for making puppets. In fact, in some modern buildings, modern magic weapons, and the Spirit Bus running on the road, many tiny parts are injected with psychic clay. materials or extracts.</p>

    <p>Once it hits the local area, it will directly cause huge damage to the economy of a city.</p>

    <p>When he saw the missile flying over, Mi XiuYuan Zun was completely panicked. The key is that he himself is also mute and eats coptis.</p>

    <p>Because they fired this missile themselves!</p>

    <p>Just on the body of the missile, there is also the Michou mark that symbolizes freedom - a white lighthouse shining with starlight!</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun and all his staff were all frightened. Seeing that the railgun was about to hit the mainland, they had no choice but to activate the interception system to defend themselves.</p>

    <p>This is a big country developed with cultivation technology. It still has the ability to accurately defend against strikes. This time, Mi XiuYuan Zun did not hesitate and issued the Yuan Zun Order again.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Another powerful cannonball was aimed at the void and flew away. The moment the two missiles collided, everyone saw a beautiful mushroom cloud blooming in the blue sky.</p>

    <p>It was a dazzling and magnificent daytime fireworks. Even at an altitude of 10,000 meters, such explosions still shocked the Mixiu Country. Many monks who were doing normal activities heard it. They all looked up to the sky. No. Find out exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>After seeing the cannon successfully intercepted, Mi XiuYuan Zun also breathed a sigh of relief. However, his expression did not calm down.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a mushroom cloud shot towards the mainland. Although it has been intercepted, as the Yuan Zun of a great cultivation country, he still needs to explain this matter.</p>

    <p>Because the mid-term voting for the new Yuan Zun was coming soon. He didn't want this incident to lower his support rate among the local monks.</p>

    <p>What's more, such a mistake will not only affect him, but also severely damage the unity and confidence of the entire Michu monks. And the most important thing is... he feels that Huaxiu has developed an "ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device" "This matter with the technology of "pure mechanized monks" must never be known to the local monks!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Yuan Zun..."</p>

    <p>In this situation, all the staff under Mi XiuYuan Zun naturally knew what his next order would be.</p>

    <p>It's also an old practice...</p>

    <p>So in the next second, the Misu Yuan Zun pressed the red button for the third time and issued the third Yuan Zun order.</p>

    <p>This time, it's not an attack. It's not a shelling either.</p>

    <p>It's "defense" on another level.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, there is a large underground laboratory in Jinghua City. This is a new cultivation and magic weapon experimental base newly established underground, led by Wang Ming and Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's identity has not been announced to the public until now. The most powerful brain in the history of Huaxiu does not care at all about his anonymity. As long as he can contribute to his country behind the scenes, then everything will be worthwhile.</p>

    <p>This experimental base also has a nice name "Cause and Effect." Full name: Cause and Effect Base.</p>

    <p>One of the characters is taken from Zhai Yin. The other character is fruit. It represents the goal that Wang Ming, as a scientific researcher, will never pursue. He hopes that his research will produce "results." After the two are combined, it is named.</p>

    <p>The safety of the Karma Base is self-evident. It is built 3,000 meters underground. The internal area is very large. It has cutting-edge equipment for trying all kinds of experiments.</p>

    <p>In terms of security, the Office of Strategic Deception provided all the technical support. In addition, now Shou Chong has joined the team. And Wang Ming himself has obtained part of the power of the divine brain. After the entire causal base is established, the level of cultivation technology begins Developed rapidly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming was sitting on a chair with a sense of technology. He was wearing a helmet on his head. Unlike many science fiction movies, the helmet was connected to many data cables and interfaces.</p>

    <p>This is purely wireless. Even three thousand meters underground, Wang Ming can still sit here and spread his thoughts.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of the divine brain, Wang Ming's current deduction ability and mental strength have been greatly enhanced. His head will almost never overheat. Zhai Yin sadly lost the opportunity to fry steak on Wang Ming's forehead...</p>

    <p>But what he got in exchange was that Wang Ming was now able to cross half the world on his own, using the mental amplification helmet he was currently wearing, to control the powerful ability of ten thousand mechanical monks at the same time!</p>

    <p>Controlling 10,000 Mechanicus at the same time. This is equivalent to opening 10,000 high-load running programs on one computer at the same time. Without huge memory space and smooth cutting-edge processors and other cutting-edge equipment, it is simply impossible to do it. If there is a problem in one link, it will crash immediately.</p>

    <p>This is also the first time Wang Ming has made such a bold attempt. Zhai Yin was worried at first. It turned out that Wang Ming's body temperature was actually normal.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Miss Zhai. Wang Ming will be fine." Shou Chong's voice came at this time. He is no longer an avatar. Wang Ming has even developed a pure mechanical monk. His new body is naturally No problem.</p>

    <p>A body made of immortal lotus root that was attuned to Wang Ling. Modern technological components installed by Wang Ming himself were added to it. The appearance of Shou Chong now is the same as when he first saw it, but the style is completely different. How can I put it...it's quite cyberpunk.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin wasn't used to Shou Chong's appearance at first, but now she has completely accepted it.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's too risky..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin frowned slightly. He looked at the huge projection in front of the base. The pictures were transmitted from different perspectives from multiple mobilized mechanical monks.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the atmosphere in the restricted area was still tense. She was worried about whether a battle would break out.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, it is inconvenient for anyone to take action first. Zhai Yin has seen too many such stalemates.</p>

    <p>She was worried that if she continued, something might happen...</p>
