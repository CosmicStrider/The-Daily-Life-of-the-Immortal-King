  <h1>Chapter 2040 Beating the Blood Demon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the process of being bombarded by countless rays, Wang Ling discovered that these blood demons were by no means as immortal as Sun Ru said.</p>

    <p>They were born due to the curse. They came after the curse. Until the cursed person could no longer breathe, the blood demon would never stop his killing spree.</p>

    <p>When the rays from the fingertips of the Palm of Law burst through these blood demon spirits from the fingertips of Wang Ling, Wang Ling's eyes almost immediately looked to somewhere in the ancient battlefield.</p>

    <p>He jumped directly into the air. Countless rays were shot out from his fingertips continuously. While moving at high speed, he was also quickly destroying the blood demon.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was stunned to see this scene.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is so handsome. All the combat movements are so smooth that it is unimaginable. Especially the way he moves and shoots at the same time. It looks like a game skill "Icathia Heavy Rain!"</p>

    <p>"Did the head of the family discover something?" Sun Ru was very curious. She wanted to follow him and have a look. But at the moment, she could only stand where she was and cooperate with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These blood demons are still mainly chasing her. If she changes her position now, she is worried that it will cause trouble to Wang Ling and reduce Wang Ling's hit rate.</p>

    <p>But it turned out that Sun Ru was overthinking it. Because Wang Ling's fingertip rays were automatically tracked. It was precisely because of this that he could perform the amazing operation of shooting with his fingertips while moving at high speed.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru, don't worry. I think Ling Zhenren must have discovered the secret of the blood demon's continuous resurgence." Immortal Toya analyzed.</p>

    <p>His premonition was very accurate. Almost at the moment when the guess was made, Wang Ling came to a crater on the battlefield. This was a completely collapsed ground. It looked like a huge crater.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The King's Eyes bloomed with Lotus. A Dharma Seal shot out from the center of the pupil. It was an engraving that had already been drawn. It continued to enlarge during the flight. The final bang sound was like a seal. It was solid and facing the huge mouth. The crater fell down.</p>

    <p>One beam after another rushed up as the engraving fell. The endless light superimposed. It seemed to be resolving some evil force buried deep under the pit.</p>

    <p>At the end, a burst of wailing whimpering from ghosts and gods was heard. It was so shocking that it made people cover their ears unconsciously. It almost felt like they were separated from each other.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya, Sun Ru's eyes widened in surprise. They tried hard to block their ears and stabilize their minds.</p>

    <p>Then. Deep in the pit, a huge black claw covered with barbs and with bright red demonic runes shining on its entire hand poked out from the bottom of the pit.</p>

    <p>The spiritual energy brought by Wang Ling was too strong, forcing the mother body of the Blood Demon, which was buried deep in the ancient battlefield and had never been discovered, to crawl out of the hole at this time.</p>

    <p>The blood demon mother body is different from the normal blood demon. It is always in a sleeping state. This is also the reason why the blood demon mother body is difficult to find.</p>

    <p>As long as the blood demon's mother body is not destroyed, he can use a strange brain wave to infinitely construct ordinary blood demons during his sleep, and use what ordinary blood demons see to restore everything in the real world in his dreams. Perform remote control operations on these small and medium-sized blood demons in dreams.</p>

    <p>This kind of trick is actually somewhat similar to the Void Creatures and the current Bai Zhe. But it is just childish in front of Wang Ling after all.</p>

    <p>As soon as the blood demon mother body stretched out a hand, Wang Ling turned into a ray of light and rushed down. It stretched out its palm and grabbed a barb on the palm. Then it yanked hard.</p>

    <p>This ugly black giant, which was more than thirty feet long, was pulled directly out of the pit and into the soil of the ground by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no expression on his face. Still holding the barb, he repeatedly beat the Blood Demon's mother body back and forth. It was as if such a huge volume could not feel its weight in Wang Ling's hands.</p>

    <p>This was half a year ago. Wang Ling might have taken some effort. But now his fighting power is becoming more and more fierce. This can also be seen from the shorter and shorter time Talisman maintains.</p>

    <p>Normally, Wang Ling has to be careful when he is on the earth. This time, although he is in the ancient battlefield of the Sun family's ancestral land, it is still an alien space. This makes Wang Ling unable to use his fists and kicks. Too much consideration.</p>

    <p>Don't worry about the surrounding buildings being destroyed by yourself.</p>

    <p>In fact, after Wang Ling threw the first round, the mother body had already died. But just in case, Wang Ling threw a few more rounds, and then suddenly threw it into the void. Raise your hand and aim at the mother body and fire another 2% Law Palm.</p>

    <p>A red shock wave roared out from the palm of Wang Ling. Like a giant dragon, it caused an explosion in the void and directly exploded the huge blood demon mother body.</p>

    <p>As soon as the mother's body was destroyed, all the small and medium-sized blood demons dissipated simultaneously. Black energy emitted from Sun Ru's body, indicating that the curse had automatically broken down.</p>

    <p>She looked at this scene in disbelief. She didn't expect that the head of the Sun family of this generation would be so strong...</p>

    <p>This is the mother body that even the founder of the family did not discover back then. It was unexpectedly discovered by this generation of the Sun family head so easily.</p>

    <p>Everything was solved. Wang Ling fell from the air with his trouser pockets inserted. His face was still expressionless. It was as if he had just stretched his muscles.</p>

    <p>"Lord Sun Ling! You are so strong!" Sun Ru expressed her sincere admiration. She changed from her previous cute look. In such an astonishing scene, her expression management was completely out of control.</p>

    <p>However, this greeting made Wang Ling feel frightened.</p>

    <p>Mr. Sun Ling is okay...</p>

    <p>Because Immortal Toya called him Ling Zhenren. And Sun Ru thought he was the real head of the Sun family. So did she just think of his name as Sun Ling?</p>

    <p>Anyway, without Sun Ru knowing about it, Wang Ling thought it would be okay to be called out like that.</p>

    <p>And he himself didn't want Sun Ru to know too much about him.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru, does he know how to enter the next map?" At this time, Immortal Toya asked instead of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Huh? Don't you know how to enter the next map, Master?"</p>

    <p>"After all, I have just succeeded...I am not very familiar with the situation in the ancestral land. Senior Sun Ru should have seen it. Ling Zhenren is obsessed with spiritual practice and hardly pays attention to other things." Immortal Toya said awkwardly. He just took over this rhetoric. It's not like I was lying to Sun Ru. Because this restriction was indeed revised just now.</p>

    <p>He thought his explanation was far-fetched. www.uukanshu.net But Sun Ru believed it completely. She showed her cute and innocent look again. She nodded repeatedly: "I understand. This is why the head of the family is so strong. In that case, let me lead the way."</p>

    <p>In ancient times, because of constant wars, there were not so many restrictions in the ancestral land. As long as the descendants who were famous in the Sun family could freely enter the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>There are countless family rules in this family today. They were all added by successive family heads after the death of Ancestor Immortal, the founder of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as a person from ancient times, it is not surprising that Sun Ru is very aware of the situation in his ancestral land.</p>

    <p>And because Wang Ling took action and easily solved the relationship with the blood demon mother body. She didn't even have any doubts about Immortal Toya's words.</p>

    <p>One is the ridiculously powerful current head of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>The other one is the descendant of Laojun who has the best relationship with the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>You can't lie to yourself, right?</p>
