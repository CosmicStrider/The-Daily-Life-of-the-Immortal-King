  <h1>Chapter 1279 The Autistic Star Lord</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the monk appeared on the Heavenly Dao star. The Lord of the Heavenly Dao star was receiving treatment.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Psychotherapy.</p>

    <p>This is the aftermath of the last battle with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao star originally relied on devouring other planets and forcibly absorbing alien civilizations into its star core to expand in the universe.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that Heavenly Dao Star Lord's plan was finally completely canceled by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As an academician of the Academy of Magical Science and one of Guo Hao's uncles, Guo Ping also assumed the role of ambassador for the establishment of peaceful diplomatic relations.</p>

    <p>Responsible for the peaceful establishment of diplomatic relations between the Earth and Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>It is said to be a peaceful establishment of diplomatic relations. In fact, it is Heavenly Dao planet unilaterally assisting the earth and providing more alien technology.</p>

    <p>He was a majestic alien overlord back then. Now he was forced to go into business and became a wholesale alien black technology boss in order to survive. Such a sense of disparity made Heavenly Dao star master heartbroken...</p>

    <p>Now the monk appeared directly in front of the Heavenly Dao Star Lord. The Star Lord, who was undergoing psychological treatment, was so frightened that he almost lost his breath.</p>

    <p>This situation made the monk sigh.</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, this is caused by insufficient cultivation.</p>

    <p>He was also beaten by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although the monk was reflecting on himself after being beaten, he was not yet autistic.</p>

    <p>Being able to fight against strong people. The biggest benefit is the summary after the battle. The stronger you fight, the more you can discover your own shortcomings.</p>

    <p>If you blindly stare at the side of your failure, it is natural for your Taoist heart to collapse.</p>

    <p>Previously, the monk also heard about Wang Ling's battle on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that the Heavenly Dao Star Lord's mind would be so fragile.</p>

    <p>"How long has he been like this?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng looked at the star Lord Heavenly Dao who had passed out with a listless face, and asked the little girl with naturally curly hair next to him.</p>

    <p>He used his only remaining swastika to see through the little girl's true identity. She was an eight-winged god.</p>

    <p>The king's chair that was originally used by the God Realm to guide the Star Lord's work was split into two halves...so they sent a lovely eight-winged god to assist the Heavenly Dao Star Lord in his work.</p>

    <p>The monk sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>There is nothing so autistic about having such a lovely girl by your side day and night.</p>

    <p>He has always had the idea of accepting a female monk as his disciple.</p>

    <p>"He has been like this for a long time. Ever since he lost, he has become worse every day. I give him psychological counseling every day, but it is useless." The girl with natural curly hair sighed.</p>

    <p>"How do you do tutoring?" The monk was curious.</p>

    <p>"Just show him the video of himself being beaten over and over again! This is called aversion therapy!"</p>

    <p>"..." The monk was shocked.</p>

    <p>This girl with natural curly hair looks extremely cute, but she is obviously not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>"Are you sent by Ling Zhenren?" the girl with natural curls transformed by the Eight-Winged God suddenly asked with her big eyes flashing.</p>

    <p>She was wearing a snow-white robe. Her whole body exuded an immortal aura. To use the words of young people on earth to label her... she was like a little angel!</p>

    <p>"As expected of someone sent by Heavenly Dao." The monk nodded and made a Buddhist salute to the naturally curly girl.</p>

    <p>He can see through girls with natural curly hair, which is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>At least it has a pivotal position in the divine world.</p>

    <p>And the wings behind the girl have not fully grown yet...</p>

    <p>In the divine world, strength is determined by wings. There are gods with hundreds of wings or even thousands of wings.</p>

    <p>But this thousand-winged god is not enough to Wang Ling drive his sword spirit to strike with a sword...</p>

    <p>As for the girl in front of me.</p>

    <p>The monk saw tens of thousands of pairs of wings through the swastika...</p>

    <p>In an instant, the monk had a rough guess about the identity of this girl with naturally curly hair.</p>

    <p>He faced the girl. He smiled and said, "I didn't expect that this poor monk would be able to meet the Lord Boundary King during this trip. He is really lucky."</p>

    <p>The girl pursed her lips and wrinkled her beautiful eyebrows: "You saw through me at a glance. You are not an ordinary monk."</p>

    <p>The so-called master's every move is fatal, nothing more than this.</p>

    <p>The monk and the King of the Divine Realm met for the first time. They had already figured out each other's identity and purpose.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the Lord Boundary King already knows the purpose of this poor monk's trip." The monk clasped his hands together and maintained the Buddhist ritual.</p>

    <p>A string of rosary beads hangs from the tiger's mouth of his right hand. Each bead exudes powerful spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>"Don't call me Lord Boundary King. It's weird. Why don't I call you Monk. Just call me Ajuan." The girl with natural curly hair was unexpectedly approachable and approachable, which surprised Monk a bit.</p>

    <p>"That poor monk is more respectful than obedient. Miss Ajuan." The monk smiled.</p>

    <p>Ajuan nodded: "We need to upgrade the earth. The amount of work is huge. And many factors must be taken into consideration."</p>

    <p>"Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang founded Heavenly Dao and then created the Divine Realm. The current culture of cultivation on earth actually originated from the Divine Realm."</p>

    <p>"However, the vast majority of cultivators on earth now don't know the existence of the divine realm."</p>

    <p>"This, the poor monk knows." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>"So. Once the earth is upgraded, after years of accumulation, the earth's cultivation civilization will eventually merge with the divine domain." It is no longer that kind of subsidiary relationship. And this matter will also involve the interests of many big families in the divine domain."</p>

    <p>"Haha. Miss Ajuan is right."</p>

    <p>The monk completely agreed with the girl.</p>

    <p>However, he also has his own opinions and views on the merger: "The civilizations between the gods and the earth have the same origin. Even if there are short-term differences, the merger will be completed sooner or later. In the opinion of the poor monk, this is the best for now. opportunity..."</p>

    <p>Regarding this matter, the monk and the girl actually knew it well.</p>

    <p>Once the ancient Golden Men in the Unspeakable Land are unsealed, it will be a huge blow to the entire cultivation civilization.</p>

    <p>By that time, it will not only be the earth that will suffer. Even the divine realm will be implicated.</p>

    <p>Therefore, God's Domain will have to intervene sooner or later.</p>

    <p>As for the interests of the big families in God's Domain, this point is actually easy to resolve.</p>

    <p>If you feel unconvinced, then discuss it...</p>

    <p>The children of the big families in God's Domain are now studying at Number 60 High School. In addition, there is Gu Shunzhi, the Heavenly Dao orderer. Several big families lead a rhythm. Even a vote can determine the winner.</p>

    <p>If you don't want to discuss it, you want to use force to solve it.</p>

    <p>The monk thought it would be easier to do.</p>

    <p>At that time, a competition will be held directly in the God's Domain. The name will be: The First God's Domain Beating Competition!</p>

    <p>Who can survive 10 palms! This matter can be discussed again!</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl with natural curly hair raised her eyebrows: "Of course. If this is Ling Zhenren's decision and he wants my help, I won't refuse. But before that, I have a request."</p>

    <p>"Is Miss Ajuan's request related to the Star Master?" the monk guessed.</p>

    <p>"There are a lot of procedures for upgrading the earth. I can't be responsible for all the steps alone. Someone has to do it for me!" the girl said.</p>

    <p>"I understand, poor monk." Hearing this, the monk nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Star Lord. It seems to be the Star Lord. In fact, the entire Heavenly Dao Star is developed from the God Realm as a civilization.</p>

    <p>This is similar to the relationship between the divine realm and the earth...</p>

    <p>The so-called Heavenly Dao star master is actually more like a servant of God.</p>

    <p>This is the God Realm imitating what Dao Ancestor Wang did back then.</p>

    <p>I want to use this method of expanding the planet to make my own civilization flourish.</p>

    <p>"In that case, then the poor monk dared to give it a try." The monk stared at the fainted Heavenly Dao Star Lord and smiled helplessly.</p>

    <p>"I knew you had a way, monk!" The girl with natural curly hair applauded.</p>

    <p>No way. Just consecrate it.</p>

    <p>The monk put his hand on the heart of Heavenly Dao Star Lord.</p>

    <p>Spiritual consecration is also within the scope of consecration.</p>

    <p>However, monks usually do not use it on people.</p>

    <p>Because the effect of spiritual consecration is too strong, sequelae are prone to occur.</p>

    <p>The advantages are obvious. There are also disadvantages.</p>

    <p>The advantages are: it has the effect of enlightening people, suddenly becoming enlightened, and getting rid of distracting thoughts...</p>

    <p>Disadvantages: Will enter sage mode for a short period of time.</p>

    <p>The sage mode of earthly cultivators usually involves clearing all their cloud disks, formatting their hard drive data, and deleting all seed files...</p>

    <p>For some fat people, this kind of spiritual consecration is a bit too cruel.</p>

    <p>But there is one thing to say.</p>

    <p>After clearing the cloud disk hard drive.</p>

    <p>It is true that the body can get better (funny).</p>
