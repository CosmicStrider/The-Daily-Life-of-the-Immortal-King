  <h1>Chapter 1954 The plot begins to develop according to what is not in the script</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The existence of Heavenly Dao is something that normal cultivators cannot touch. Even the {Wuji Sword} comprehended by General Yi. As one of the ten generals, this path is essentially just a branch of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Only by reaching the realm of Venerated Immortal can one touch what Heavenly Dao is. However, the number of Heavenly Dao understood by the realm of Venerated Immortal is also limited.</p>

    <p>After all, no one is like Wang Ling. He is a monster with ten thousand universes and thirty thousand Heavenly Daos...</p>

    <p>This is something that is incomprehensible. Therefore, the existence of {Great Luck Technique} is completely a super problem for Teng Luchen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cast the {Great Luck Technique} to temporarily change the luck of Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan. This was something Teng Luchen could not have predicted no matter how he calculated.</p>

    <p>He had no idea what kind of man he was fighting against...</p>

    <p>Even though Teng Luchen thinks Wang Ling is a very strong genius, his upper limit knowledge of Wang Ling is still limited. He may feel that Wang Ling has achieved an extraordinary level at this age. But it is far from the realm above True Immortal.</p>

    <p>He would never have thought that the Heavenly Dao owned by Wang Ling would be a dimension-reducing blow to him.</p>

    <p>"Boss, our mission has been completed. Have all the debts of this sect been paid off?" Li Changzhe rubbed his hands with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>They had only been in the mine for less than half an hour. They had already completed the task ahead of schedule.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the high-grade fire spirit stone. With only the ultimate fire spirit stone, they can not only directly help the sect pay off its debts, but also make a lot of money from the boss.</p>

    <p>At this time, both the mine owner and the mine manager were confused. The script they received was a villain role. They wanted to play this kind of cunning and dirty boss who tramples on other people's personalities with money.</p>

    <p>As a result, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan dug in like this. The plot started to develop according to what was not in the script...</p>

    <p>This made both of them extremely nervous.</p>

    <p>According to the contract signed in the previous plot, they need to pay back. But they are just actors after all, and they don't have that much money!</p>

    <p>But soon, Li Changzhe put forward a condition: "Let's do this, boss. We don't want the money we make anymore. You just let everyone here be free."</p>

    <p>The mine boss looked confused. He thought carefully. It seemed that he had no choice. In the end, he could only nod and agree: "Okay. You did a good job..."</p>

    <p>"Everywhere. It's all thanks to the boss." Li Changzhe smiled slightly. Then he threw away the mining pick and led the collective liberation of many people trapped in the mine.</p>

    <p>Everyone's faces were filled with smiles of happiness and joy. They rushed out of the dark, cramped and damp mine...</p>

    <p>Although for Wang Ling, their experience in the mine only lasted half an hour, the joy of regaining freedom was very real.</p>

    <p>Especially in this atmosphere, it is easier to appreciate this hard-won feeling of freedom.</p>

    <p>"Did the options pop up in your eyes just now?" At this time, Zhang Linyan asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes! So I went directly to the mine boss and said I didn't want the money. I wanted freedom." Li Changzhe responded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was listening to the conversation between the two. In his heart, he felt that the three of them had a good understanding this time.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also received a new choice just now. This time the choice was very convenient. He also chose to give up money to liberate the workers in the mine.</p>

    <p>Integrate all the resources you have.</p>

    <p>Counting the choices just made. Wang Ling already has three high-grade spiritual weapons and one privilege card in his hand. Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan each have two high-grade spiritual weapons.</p>

    <p>And now, these spiritual weapons are in an unextracted state. The rewards for the spiritual weapons are random. When needed, you can directly turn the electronic bracelet on your wrist to select and extract according to the projected image.</p>

    <p>The magic weapon flow is still easy to understand. The only thing that he can't understand at the moment is the privilege card in Wang Ling's hand...</p>

    <p>According to the rules of this trial, all cultivation resources can be brought back to the real world. This includes magic weapons, elixirs, and various rewards of heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p>

    <p>But only the privilege card can be used or saved. He just doesn't know what the purpose of this privilege card is.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling actually has a privilege card. The explosion rate of this thing seems to be quite low. It is not given in every mission." Li Changzhe was suspicious.</p>

    <p>"Since it is a privilege card, what effect does it have?" Zhang Linyan asked.</p>

    <p>"I think it's better to keep it first. Don't use it lightly."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe said using the team communication technique. Then he looked at the eldest brother of Haoren Peak. He bowed respectfully: "Elder brother, we have paid off the sect's foreign debt. Can we go all out to develop the sect next?"</p>

    <p>"This is... natural. Now our next task is to collect as many resources as possible." The senior brother wiped his sweat. The expression on his face was extremely wonderful. He didn't know how to deal with the situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>The development of any sect is a long-term plan. Compared with other sects here, the Haoren Sect is really lagging behind. Even the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Formation at Haoren Peak is close to being exhausted. But the old headmaster Hao Jian has always refused to move.</p>

    <p>This is also an issue that Li Changzhe and the others need to consider. If they want the Haoren Sect to develop, it is actually crucial to repair the sect's spirit gathering formation.</p>

    <p>But how easy is it to repair a large formation to maintain the sect with just the resources they have?</p>

    <p>"Please let us...let us also join the Good People Sect!"</p>

    <p>Just as everyone in Wang Ling was communicating with their senior brother, a stout man with a beard among the rescued miners suddenly stood up and said.</p>

    <p>As soon as he spoke out, the remaining dozens of miners also shouted: "Yes! Please let us help too! We want to join the Good People Sect!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "You want to join the Good People Sect? Aren't you going to go back to your own sect?"</p>

    <p>The big man named the leader said: "My name is Tieyi. I originally came from Wuxiang Peak. The brothers behind me are also disciples from other peaks. We were sent here to mine. There is no end. The sect said it was to let us know that we are cultivating here. But in fact, they just want to use us as cheap labor force... In this case, I think we might as well join the Good People Sect directly! It is you who gave us freedom!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling instantly understood. This is the cause and effect of the plot. Because they made the choice to liberate the miners, the Good People Sect suddenly gained a team of seventy-six cultivators.</p>

    <p>Developing a sect still requires manpower. Especially when one's own strength cannot be exposed. The more people there are, the more cover they can provide for themselves.</p>

    <p>Moreover, manpower is also crucial to repair the sect's spirit gathering formation!</p>

    <p>Now the human resources have been solved. The key is to repair the sect's materials. How to solve it.</p>

    <p>At this moment. Three more options appeared in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>[Choice 1: Listen to the follow-up advice of Senior Brother Haorenfeng. Slowly collect supplies. Mission reward: a random high-grade spiritual weapon.]</p>

    <p>[Option 2: Ask the miners about ways to quickly collect materials. Mission reward: a random high-grade spiritual weapon. A random third-level advanced spell.]</p>

    <p>[Option 3: Go directly to Phaseless Peak to rob! Mission reward: a random high-grade spiritual weapon. A random fourth-level advanced spell. A box of crispy noodles!]</p>
