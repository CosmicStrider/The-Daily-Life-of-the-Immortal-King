  <h1>Chapter 1988 The Immortal King's Daily Life Animation Season 2 starts tomorrow</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong does not like Su Xingyue. The reason is very simple. Simply because Su Xingyue's first rude test left a very bad impression on her.</p>

    <p>However, under such circumstances, she actually dared to come alone to ask for reconciliation. This kind of courage is still very admirable in Sun Rong's view.</p>

    <p>A genius in the number one university. He is also a wizard in alchemy. If Su Xingyue was also in Number 60 High School. Sun Rong feels that she and Su Xingyue should be very good friends.</p>

    <p>It's just a pity that so far, they are still on opposite sides of each other.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. What do you think of Su Xingyue?" At this time, Sun Rong in the student union office looked aside to Jiugong Liangzi, who was sitting on the sofa and slowly sipping tea.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's appearance. In fact, Sun Rong did not ask her to come. In addition, because of her status as an exchange student, Jiugong Liangzi's class at Number 60 High School is actually very casual. It doesn't matter whether she comes or not. It's so famous. Just come to experience the rigorous learning atmosphere in Huaxiu...</p>

    <p>Suddenly his name was called. Jiugong Liangzi was holding tea. He pretended to be cold and snorted: "Let's talk about it first. It's all because the guy Zhuo Yi is worried that Shengke will do some tricks. Let me come here."</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded and smiled slightly. She was already very familiar with Jiugong Liangzi's character: "There is a saying that the authorities are confused and the beholder is clear. I have Liangzi as a strategist to help me give advice. I can't thank you enough."</p>

    <p>"Well. It's good if you know." Jiugong Liangzi nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Liangzi. I never asked you before. Have Jiudaohe ever had any dealings with Shengke?"</p>

    <p>"That's natural. After all, Jiudaohe is also a famous high school on Sun Island. There is no shortage of international exchanges in previous years. Shengke has been the number one high school cultivation academy for many years. Of course, there are also exchanges of feelings between our two schools."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said while thinking: "I remember that the last class before Jisaki became the student union president... he was sent to communicate with Shengke."</p>

    <p>"What happened next?"</p>

    <p>"At that time, Shengke specially renovated an on-campus training hall and designed it into a demon-erasing hall. There were dedicated teachers and safety consultants. Some captured ghosts would be placed in the demon-erasing hall. Then representatives from the two schools would be inside. Competition to eliminate demons."</p>

    <p>"It sounds quite generous. It's very thoughtful."</p>

    <p>"Yes. We thought Shengke was very attentive at first. But who knew that after the seniors of that class entered, not a single ghost was caught. Instead, they were treated as ghosts and beaten up."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"I don't know the specific situation. But I heard from the seniors of that class that the Shengke students who were chasing them were very excited at the time. They shouted loudly, such as "defeat the Japanese", "the father's debt must be paid by the son," and we are not qualified to ask for forgiveness from our ancestors. Ah and stuff like that. I actually still don't quite understand what it means."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, sweat began to form on Sun Rong's cheeks. After being stunned for several seconds, he said: "Then... what happens next?"</p>

    <p>"Then they said it was a misunderstanding. An accidental injury. Shengke paid for the medical expenses and a bunch of material supplements. The matter was settled."</p>

    <p>"That's it..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong showed an expression of realization.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that Shengke would actually do quite well in patriotism education.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that in order to demonstrate their inclusiveness and international status, the top-ranked universities are usually deeply influenced by the West in some aspects...</p>

    <p>Now it seems that she still has some misunderstandings about Shengke.</p>

    <p>Although the principal is a lunatic in everyone's eyes and the president of the student union is a pervert with a twisted mentality... he cannot beat all the students to death with a stick.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had heard about the Spirit World Trial Field before. Because of Qu Shuling's performance, Shengke's participation in the Earth Center Project may be canceled directly.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong guessed that Su Xingyue came to see him this time. On the surface, it was to seek reconciliation for Qu Shuling. In fact, he also wanted to preserve Shengke's original plan for participating in the Earth Center Project.</p>

    <p>If Jingmi Academy directly excludes Shengke from the list, their status and face as the number one university will be gone.</p>

    <p>Dong dong dong</p>

    <p>At this time, there was a gentle knocking on the door of the student union office, directly interrupting Sun Rong's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Come in. Student Su." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Su Xingyue was still nervous before entering the student union. She had participated in countless international competitions, but she had never been as nervous as she was today.</p>

    <p>Of course, when she entered the student union gate and saw Jiugong Liangzi sitting in the office, she immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Of course Su Xingyue also understands the grudge between Jiudaohe and Shengke.</p>

    <p>Although she had heard about it before. The eldest daughter of the Jiugong family came to Number 60 High School as an exchange student. But she never expected that she would appear on this occasion...</p>

    <p>So is this to seek revenge for the "Japanese Incident" that year...</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce you to Mr. Su. This is Ms. Jiugong Liangzi from the Jiugong family. She is currently an exchange student at Number 60 High School." Sun Rong got straight to the point. He said directly without hesitation: "But I think the same goes for Mr. Su. I have already done a careful investigation. Even if I didn't come here in person, it should be included in Shengke's data pagoda, right?"</p>

    <p>This was a straight punch. And it was the kind that stabbed straight into the heart. Su Xingyue couldn't hold back on the spot.</p>

    <p>She quickly bowed and apologized: "As classmate Sun said, I know Miss Jiugong Liangzi. I am very sorry about the last time I came to your school to test for information. Before I came here, I had asked the Data Pagoda in the name of the President of the Student Union. The staff of Number 60 High School cleared all the information. It is a great sincerity for me to come on this trip..."</p>

    <p>These words sound quite pertinent.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi nodded secretly at Sun Rong. After the two women looked at each other, Sun Rong took the initiative to make tea for Su Xingyue: "Student Su, don't be so nervous. Sit down first. Come on. Let's talk while drinking tea."</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue promised. But in fact, she knew very well that now was definitely not the time to enjoy tea leisurely. It was already very difficult for her to come to Number 60 High School this time.</p>

    <p>God knows if there will be a chance to meet Sun Rong next time...</p>

    <p>"I know the purpose of Student Su's trip."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong pushed the tea cup in front of Su Xingyue: "I think this is the best arrangement for the punishment of Student Qu to preserve the face of Shengke. And this is also the best arrangement for the managers of Jingmi Academy. There is a consensus. No matter how rich and powerful we are, the Sun family or the Jiugong family, they can't get a word in."</p>

    <p>"No...Classmate Sun. You misunderstood."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue had no intention of drinking tea. She just kept circling with her two index fingers. This was a sign of extreme nervousness: "That's it... I just want to ask... It's just that... I wonder if Mr. Sun can help me." Move classmates Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan...as long as they can issue a letter of understanding..."</p>

    <p>"But I'm not familiar with them..."</p>

    <p>"I know." Su Xingyue said: "But classmate Wang Ling is very familiar with them... Plus you are very familiar with classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi both understood.</p>

    <p>Good guy. I'm here to do math problems for them...</p>
