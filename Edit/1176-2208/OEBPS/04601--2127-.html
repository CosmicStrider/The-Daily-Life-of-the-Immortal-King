  <h1>Chapter 2127 Changing Fate Against Heaven</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A novice general from a small town with 300,000 blood... this time made Sun Rong feel unreal.</p>

    <p>She was very surprised.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling himself was also surprised.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, I only had 300,000 drops during my continuous recitation of the Heart Sutra.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>After all, it was because I spoke slowly.</p>

    <p>But this thing can't be made fast. After all, the verses he recited need to be recognized by the system. If he reads too fast, the system will not be able to recognize them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know if this is considered as forcing a debuff on myself. But after all, I am only in Novice Village now.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if 300,000 blood points Wang Ling is more or less. It should be enough, right?</p>

    <p>It's a pity that his character level is still not enough. Because he was "lucky" to trigger hidden tasks from beginning to end. And hidden tasks have no experience rewards. Except for rare identities, equipment and specific inheritances, his character level is still the same. Only level 1.</p>

    <p>And this is the key to making Sun Rong feel twice as outrageous.</p>

    <p>A level 1 general... has 300,000 drops of blood! This is not justified!</p>

    <p>But now Sun Rong is also clear. Now is not the time to complain.</p>

    <p>The demon caves around Fuyun Town were about to launch an attack here. This level 1 general just walked out on his own with 300,000 drops of blood.</p>

    <p>What a righteous and awe-inspiring leader who cares for the people.</p>

    <p>Although this was just an NPC in the game world, at this moment Sun Rong suddenly felt that the mysterious Fuyun Town general wearing a mask in front of him looked very much like a real person. All of this was too real.</p>

    <p>"General. Wait for me!"</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling drifting away. Sun Rong hurriedly followed up wearing a heavy suit of armor. She ran very slowly. By the time she caught up with Wang Ling, there was already a faint sound coming from the south of the town. The sound of demonic spirits making trouble.</p>

    <p>These screams with a terrifying atmosphere are like the wails of ghosts. The sound becomes more and more intense from far to near. This is a strategic deterrent. From the sound to the body feeling, it is extremely real.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling squatted half-crouched and touched the ground. He felt the distance of these five hundred demon spirits from far to near. He was fighting against five hundred demon spirits by himself. It was unrealistic to kill all these demon spirits. And it was too far. Waste of time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling's fighting idea was clear from the beginning. Capture the thief first and capture the king. There must be a commander of the Demon Cave among these demon spirits.</p>

    <p>Five hundred demon spirits. That is at least the demon power gathered from the ten demon caves around Fuyun Town. And what Wang Ling needs to do now is to lead these ten caves.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was completely dumbfounded. He never expected that this general could be so brave and fearless. The look in his eyes couldn't help but overlap with the image of the young man in his mind.</p>

    <p>Impossible...</p>

    <p>She must have been dazzled by what she saw. But the general's back as he walked past her often overlapped with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>What if this person is really Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>For a moment Sun Rong was a little distracted and imaginative. But she didn't dare to think about it in detail. She was afraid that she would make a mistake in judgment this time.</p>

    <p>What if the real classmate Wang Ling came out later. Wouldn't she be embarrassed herself?</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The voices of five hundred demon spirits were approaching. They all had different shapes. Most of them were walking beasts. Their images were ferocious. Wang Ling showed no fear and only stared at the largest monster as it walked over. This monster was obviously Different from other demon spirits, Yue is three to four feet tall. His body is covered with thick scales, like a pangolin.</p>

    <p>Its eyes were scarlet, with a hint of ferocity. It seemed that it did not expect that this person with only level 1 would take the initiative to approach it. After being stunned for a moment, it used its eyes to signal the little monsters around it not to attack immediately. Gu Gambling</p>

    <p>This is the plot development.</p>

    <p>According to the current game plot, players need to kill the bosses of these ten holes within a limited time. The surrounding monsters will not take action. If the task is not completed within the time limit, not only will the leader be resurrected with full blood, but the surrounding monsters will also riot instantly.</p>

    <p>This is the leader of the Ten Cave. Sun Rong looks at the blood volume of this leader from a distance. Ten thousand drops of blood!</p>

    <p>It takes a lot of effort for players to form a group and challenge together. Even if this is the initial boss of the Novice Village, it is still difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>But what Sun Rong didn't expect now is that since this general as an NPC went up on his own, did he need to help?</p>

    <p>Or is it because he joined the general's mansion. This npc general is here to help him pass the level?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels like he is a bit lucky.</p>

    <p>But the general of Fuyun Town is only level 1. No matter how much blood he has, how long will it take to grind out these 10,000 drops of blood!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong seriously doubts this.</p>

    <p>But the facts proved that Sun Rong was overthinking himself after all.</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling walking past so calmly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling's power value continued to soar. A faint golden aura began to linger around him. This was a sign that huge spiritual energy rushed out of the body.</p>

    <p>In addition to superimposing HP through the passive layers of {The God Descends to Earth}, Wang Ling also explored the operation of the technique by reciting formulas and also figured out other techniques that can be used in conjunction with the {{God Descends to Earth}'s technique.</p>

    <p>At this moment, what he had realized before in the General's Mansion, {Changing Fate Against Heaven}, played a vital role.</p>

    <p>This is a skill that has a relatively simple passive ability, but can create miracles.</p>

    <p>"Skill Name: {Change Fate Against Heaven}"</p>

    <p>"Level: God level."</p>

    <p>"Instructions: 1 Whenever the current enemy's level is ahead of yours, the passive ability of this skill will be triggered. For every level ahead, you will be deemed to automatically gain 5 attribute points, which will be added evenly to each of your attribute points. When you are besieged by multiple people. It is determined by the level leading number of the person with the highest level."</p>

    <p>"2 You gain additional passive abilities. This passive ability will be based on your current health status. For example, your level is lower than the enemy. But you are stronger than the opponent in a certain attribute (including health and psychic energy). This stat will automatically be compared to the current enemy's. The difference will be treated as your current temporary strength value."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In other words. Wang Ling's current level is indeed very low. But this is also the result of Wang Ling's deliberate suppression of level.</p>

    <p>Now his level is lower than the leader of the Ten Cave Demon Spirits. However, his blood volume is 290,000 higher than the other leader.</p>

    <p>This also means that the total temporary strength points he has currently obtained are 290,000 points!</p>

    <p>So. He walked over so calmly. Faced with a monster with such a huge difference in size and level, the expression under the mask did not change from the beginning to the end.</p>

    <p>"goodbye."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed softly.</p>

    <p>A finger poked the big toe of the leader of the Ten Caves.</p>

    <p>Then. A jaw-dropping scene happened. The leader of the Ten-hole Demon Spirit was stabbed by Wang Ling's finger and took off directly on the spot. It flew backwards...</p>

    <p>The body as big as a mountain made a roar. It moved directly backwards, plowing ravines on the ground. Huge spiritual energy attached to its body and burned. The defense of the scales was powerless to stop it. The leader of the ten cave demon spirits was unable to stop it. Disintegrated in public. Not even a single scale was left...</p>
