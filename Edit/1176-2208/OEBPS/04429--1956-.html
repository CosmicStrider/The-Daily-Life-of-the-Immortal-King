  <h1>Chapter 1956 Crusade against Phaseless Peak</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he should have seen it clearly a long time ago. Teng Luchen's goal is to test him. So no matter what he chooses next, the final plot trend will develop towards the plot of "Conquering Wuxiang Peak."</p>

    <p>But fortunately, Wang Ling was already prepared for this matter. It was impossible for him to be led by Teng Luchen all the way...</p>

    <p>At the same time. In the holographic Internet cafe of the Office of Strategic Deception. Sun Rong, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Gu Shunzhi, Zhen Yuan and Lord Diulei were gathered here by Bai Qiao in the name of testing a new game.</p>

    <p>They all wore Number 60 High School uniforms. They all used their identities at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>This time, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were brought to play. It was actually proposed by Lord Diulei, because he thought it would be more interesting. Of course, Lord Diulei had already mentioned it to everyone in the whole sect. He would not let Chen Chao and Guo Hao know their true identities.</p>

    <p>However, a group of disciples were shocked by the appearance of Chen Chao and Guo Hao. Sun Rong needless to mention. The eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group is very famous in the Office of Strategic Deception. And the Huaguo Shuilian Group She is also one of the partners of the Office of Strategic Deception. It is not surprising that she appears here.</p>

    <p>But who are these two people... They can actually play games with Gu Shunzhi, an immortal at the level of a great elder! Even Sect Master Diulei is kind to them!</p>

    <p>A group of disciples were a little confused. Could this be the treatment that normal high school students could enjoy? There must be something extraordinary about these two people!</p>

    <p>"Don't you understand? These two were invited by Elder Bai Qiao to play games in our Office of Strategic Deception holographic Internet cafe before. I remember them. But you newcomers, I'm afraid you don't know." An old disciple looked like he was in control.</p>

    <p>"Senior brother, do you know their origins?"</p>

    <p>"They are unusual. It is not something you or I can interfere with. You should do your job honestly. Also tell other disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception. If you see these two coming to the Office of Strategic Deception in the future, you must be more polite."</p>

    <p>"Yes..." A group of disciples remained silent. They were surprised by the appearance of Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>On the other side, after Bai Qiao tested that all the equipment could operate normally, she immediately motioned for everyone to sit in the holographic cabin.</p>

    <p>"I thought the previous cultivation simulator was quite fun. What type of game are you testing today?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh. I won't let you down." Bai Qiao deliberately let it slip.</p>

    <p>Then the start button was pressed and the hatch was closed.</p>

    <p>In fact, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were invited together this time. What they participated in was not a game at all.</p>

    <p>Rather, it was designed by Sun Rong, Wang Ming and Wang Ling from the beginning.</p>

    <p>They will conduct a temporary soul exchange with the Gray Cult disciple who is responsible for supporting the spirit world based on Wang Ling's Wang Ling Wang Ling pre-arranged {{Great Spirit Replacement Technique}.</p>

    <p>During the soul exchange period, the party whose soul is exchanged will fall into a closed state and have no memory of what happened during the soul exchange. It is like sleeping.</p>

    <p>Of course. It will not cause any damage to the body.</p>

    <p>In order to successfully perform the {Great Spirit Substitution Technique}, Wang Ming had developed a spare electronic bracelet in advance. As soon as he entered the Internet cafe, he tricked Chen Chao, Guo Hao and others into wearing it.</p>

    <p>This is a secondary bracelet of the electronic bracelet. It is associated with the wearer of the main bracelet whose soul is replaced. It can accurately locate the location of the person who needs to exchange the soul.</p>

    <p>Once the spell is activated, it's almost like entering the holographic game world. It's just that you use someone else's body.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Deep in the dense forest. Wang Ling pretended to be too nervous. He sat cross-legged and began to adjust his breath. In fact, he was waiting for a signal.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling's appearance, Tie Yi couldn't help but laugh: "Classmate, Wang, are you okay? You don't have to be so afraid of disturbing the mountain guard. With a few brothers leading the way, there won't be any problem."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling rolled his eyes silently in his heart. He didn't believe a word of what the actors in these scripts said.</p>

    <p>These bad old men are very bad.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has already guessed their subsequent plan. If they follow Tieyi and continue walking along this dense forest path, they will definitely alert the mountain guard.</p>

    <p>But the guarding mountain spirit only needs to move.</p>

    <p>The Wuxiang Peak side must also know that their resource areas have been invaded by outsiders. At that time, they will inevitably make a certain degree of defense. A big war is inevitable.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling just sat down and rested on the spot. In fact, it disrupted Tie Yi's rhythm. However, he didn't urge him many times after he reminded him.</p>

    <p>Otherwise the traces of the script would be too obvious.</p>

    <p>He is a professional actor. Of course he must impress the audience with his natural performance.</p>

    <p>While waiting for Wang Ling to rest, Tie Yi also kept looking at Wang Ling. He felt that the young man in front of him was actually very real.</p>

    <p>It only has the strength of the Foundation Building stage. Facing the peak of Golden Core in the later stage and even reaching the peak of Nascent Soul in the early stage. It is very real to feel scared.</p>

    <p>After only walking so long, I was already so frightened that my legs could no longer stand and I needed to sit down cross-legged to meditate and adjust my breathing.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe didn't push it too much. They had a certain fondness for Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>In addition, among the three of them, Wang Ling is indeed at the lowest level. The two of them will naturally have a sense of empathy to take care of the weak...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also discovered it. He seems to have the talent to be a "group favorite."</p>

    <p>He was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Among the many branch skills of Heavenly Dao, there is no such ability as "Big Group Pet Technique."</p>

    <p>Why does he try every means to distance himself from other people. But those people will get closer and closer to him?</p>

    <p>About twenty minutes passed. Just when Tieyi was getting impatient, Wang Ling, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Are you here..." He looked up at the sky, as if he sensed something.</p>

    <p>Buzz...</p>

    <p>Centered on this dense forest and the nearest Phaseless Peak. I don't know why everyone in the deep forest seemed to hear a charging sound similar to the sound of a horn at this moment...</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>"Crunt against Wuxiang Peak! Capture the leader of Wuxiang Sect alive!"</p>

    <p>Along with the sound of charging, there were also the roars of many people. It seemed as if some large-scale battle was going on.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>In the end, even the earth-shattering explosions were heard, not far from the dense forest.</p>

    <p>Tie Yi and others instantly cast their sights in the direction of the Phaseless Peak.</p>

    <p>Can't go wrong!</p>

    <p>This huge explosion came from the location of Phaseless Peak!</p>

    <p>Someone is attacking Phaseless Peak!</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>This isn't someone's problem...it's a bunch of people attacking Phaseless Peak!</p>

    <p>"What's going on..." All the miners led by Tieyi were dumbfounded at this moment. Because this was something that was not written in the script at all.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that Wuxiang Peak would be surrounded and suppressed at this time.</p>

    <p>"Roar!" At the same moment, deep in the dense forest, the shaken guardian mountain spirit let out a roar that shook the sky.</p>

    <p>It no longer cared about the small army of Wang Ling in the dense forest. It headed straight for the gate of Wuxiang Peak.</p>
