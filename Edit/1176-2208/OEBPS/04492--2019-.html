  <h1>Chapter 2019 The Ancestral Land of the Sun Family</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For a family that has always had a certain reputation in the world of cultivation, the importance and confidentiality of the family's ancestral land is self-evident.</p>

    <p>Whether it is the Sun family who built the Huaguo Shuilian Group through elixirs, the Xiang family who made their fortune through Talisman, or the Jiugong family who is famous for exterminating demons on Sun Island, almost all of them have their ancestral home.</p>

    <p>However, the existence of the ancestral land is a secret. Only a few people know its existence. Because for these families, the ancestral land is an important place for the family's lifeline.</p>

    <p>Not only does it contain important information that can be used by a large family at critical moments, it is also an important place in the family's feng shui and lifeline. If a hostile outsider knows the location, it is very likely that they will do harm.</p>

    <p>Once the ancestral land is destroyed, it may directly affect the future destiny of the entire family.</p>

    <p>Of course, the fewer people who know such an important secret, the better. And the family also has family rules for such top secrets. Anyone who leaks it is a traitor to the family and may be directly removed from the family and driven out. family.</p>

    <p>So after hearing about Immortal Toya inquiring about the Sun family's ancestral land, Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"I know. The matter of the ancestral land is of great importance. If Miss Sun refuses to talk, I will understand." Immortal Toya sighed and said.</p>

    <p>He had actually expected this result. The so-called filial piety comes first. Respecting ancestors is also a manifestation of filial piety. What's more, the big cultivating families who own the ancestral land have rules. Such rules cannot be easily broken.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. Toya-senpai and... classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's expression was also quite helpless. Wang Ling could clearly feel that she was nervous. Even her heartbeat speeded up involuntarily: "Only this matter. Even if I know about it, I can't tell you in detail. Said. Although I know that Toya-senpai and classmate Wang Ling definitely have no ill intentions..."</p>

    <p>Regarding Sun Rong's answer. Immortal Toya was obviously a little surprised.</p>

    <p>"Then what Miss Sun means, can it be understood that you don't know about it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, senior."</p>

    <p>"But apart from you, the Sun family should have no other heirs, right?"</p>

    <p>"The ancestral land is of great importance. Even the heir, as long as he has not ascended to the position of the head of the family, is unaware of it. I don't know what the rules of other families are. But the rules of the Sun family have been like this since ancient times."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "Generally speaking, the location of the ancestral land will be handed over by the previous generation head of the family in the form of a secret document only when the succeeding head of the family is confirmed. On the day of the succession ceremony."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded secretly. For most casual cultivators who are used to practicing independently, sometimes they really don't understand the situation of the family very well.</p>

    <p>In particular, the cultivation family has experienced many generations of evolution. In fact, there have been obvious changes between the ancient family and the modern cultivation family. There are many detailed issues that are difficult for people in the family to know the details.</p>

    <p>"As for the news about the ancestral land, does Miss Sun know anything?"</p>

    <p>"They are just some rumors..." Sun Rong said with an embarrassed smile: "Anyway, I heard that the ancestral home of the Sun family is a palace."</p>

    <p>Palace?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows: "No. Water Curtain Cave?"</p>

    <p>"Aiyou. I found Wang Ling that you are quite humorous sometimes." Sun Rong couldn't help laughing immediately.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Although Shuiliandong is the ancestral property of my grandson family, it is just a real estate. And the place is too hidden. It is not suitable to use it as ancestral land. The ancestral land is a place where family secrets and heritage are sealed."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said this. He also became curious. He looked at Immortal Toya and Wang Ling and asked, "I know that classmate Wang Ling and Toya-senpai will not be surprised at the ancestral land of my Sun family. But I am still very curious... looking for those alien beings that have sneaked into the earth and the Eternal Ones who have sneaked in using soul planting methods. What does it have to do with the ancestral land of my Sun family? Why do seniors want to inquire about this matter?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya heard this. He glanced at Wang Ling first. After Wang Ling nodded, he calmed down and spoke.</p>

    <p>"That's it, Miss Sun. I wonder if you still remember the Yin-Yang Death Tribulation."</p>

    <p>"Of course!"Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>That memory. She can never forget it to this day. The evil Heavenly DaoGolden Men, the Buddha Golden Lotus, the unspeakable place and... the end of the sky, the top of the palm. She wrote all these things clearly in a small notebook .</p>

    <p>And the diary Sun Rong also made a decision.</p>

    <p>That is, once he succeeds as the head of the family, he will directly seal this diary into the family ancestral land forever.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought that the Yin and Yang Death Tribulation had long come to an end. Unexpectedly, the revival of the old incident was still related to it. And it was also a major event related to the ancestral land.</p>

    <p>"It's not that the seal of the Unspeakable Land was loosened so that the evil Heavenly DaoGolden Men could take advantage of it. Moreover, classmate Wang Ling also took action in time."</p>

    <p>"That's right. But the old man who foretold the Yin-Yang death disaster has not been found yet, hasn't he?"</p>

    <p>"I remember the old gentleman guessed that it was... Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a guess. But the specific identity is not yet known."</p>

    <p>"So. How does this relate to our Sun family's ancestral land?"</p>

    <p>"This is Ling Zhenren's idea. Although I don't know how Ling Zhenren came to this conclusion." At this time, Immortal Toya looked at Sun Rong. He said seriously: "But since it is Ling Zhenren's statement. That should be an inference. Ling Zhenren suspects that the ancestor of the Sun family may still be alive..."</p>

    <p>The scene was silent for a long moment.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's pupils began to tremble violently and contract.</p>

    <p>The Sun family... the ancestor?</p>

    <p>Still alive?</p>

    <p>If this was the inference made by others, it would be impossible for Sun Rong to believe this. But this is the conclusion reached by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is also a brand-new speculation of Wang Ling based on this soul planting incident.</p>

    <p>He has been looking for Dao Ancestor Wang all this time. And he can confirm that Dao Ancestor Wang is indeed still alive in the universe.</p>

    <p>Because the spirit of his Dharma.Zheng. is still alive in the universe.</p>

    <p>If Dao Ancestor Wang splits, then Zheng will naturally cease to exist.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling had suspected that the person who proposed the yin-yang death calamity to Sun Rong was Dao Ancestor Wang himself. As for why the old man's focus was now shifted to the ancestor of the Sun family. In fact Shang is also inseparable from Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>There is one thing that Wang Ling did not mention to Sun Rong because it involves too many things. The more Sun Rong knows, the more dangerous it will be.</p>

    <p>Because now he is very doubtful.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Dao Ancestor Wang used the method of soul planting a long time ago and became an earth cultivator.</p>

    <p>According to the deduction results of various Heavenly Dao spells of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If Dao Ancestor Wang uses soul planting to change his identity, the most suitable body on earth for Dao Ancestor Wang to plant is the founder of the Sun family who was sealed in the Sun family's ancestral land ten thousand years ago...</p>
