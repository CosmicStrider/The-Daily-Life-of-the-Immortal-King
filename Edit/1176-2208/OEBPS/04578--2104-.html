  <h1>Chapter 2104 Itinerant Immortal Child Magic Ring</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Cloud Disk..."</p>

    <p>When Zhai Yin heard this, she was stunned because she thought she had misheard... After all, it was ranked as a miracle of the universe.</p>

    <p>It took her a long time to roughly understand it under Wang Ming's explanation. Although she was not too clear, it was not simple.</p>

    <p>For the time being, all the miracles of the universe that appear now can be regarded as puzzle pieces of the will of the universe. Each piece of the puzzle has its own special way of doing things.</p>

    <p>That is beyond the dimensional plane. It is far better than the existence outside the earth. The result is good now. It can be used directly as a cloud disk as an intermediary to process data, which is okay.</p>

    <p>Is this an operation that normal carbon-based organisms can think of...</p>

    <p>Maybe others can't. But with Wang Ming's thinking ability, Zhai Yin thinks it's not absolutely impossible.</p>

    <p>"How to do it specifically?" Zhai Yin asked. She was very curious. Tiandaoyun was directly used as a cloud disk... Is it really not allowed to have any objections?</p>

    <p>This is a cosmic miracle... a miracle!</p>

    <p>"Break the wall directly. It's too obvious. We have to do it quietly. We just need this Tiandaoyun to cooperate with us." Shou Chong said calmly; "I think. It will cooperate."</p>

    <p>After all, Tiandaoyun's action was to prove himself. He took the opportunity to join Wang Ling. As long as he can prove himself, whether he wants it to fight or be a processor.</p>

    <p>In fact, cosmic miracles are part of the will of the universe. To intervene in the consciousness of the monks on earth, not only Tiandaoyun can do it. Other cosmic miracles can also do it.</p>

    <p>But he didn't know why, but Shou Chong felt a very familiar feeling when he heard the name Tiandaoyun.</p>

    <p>And compared to other cloud disks, the biggest advantage of Tiandaoyun is that it has almost unlimited cloud storage space. And there is no speed limit even if you don't have a membership!</p>

    <p>After listening to a series of detailed explanations by Shou Chong, Zhai Yin's mouth twitched. Sure enough... unlimited storage space and unlimited speed are the key!</p>

    <p>It has to be said. The use of the cosmic miracle Tiandaoyun serves as an intermediate intervention point, allowing hundreds of millions of monks in the entire country who are affected by the wall of spiritual consciousness to directly break through the wall and see the reality clearly.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling heard such an operation, he would have to say secretly that his imagination would be opened.</p>

    <p>At this moment, although Wang Ling is still struggling in the Sun family's ancestral land and is about to touch the truth, he is also always paying attention to changes in the external situation.</p>

    <p>Two brothers, one solves internal problems and the other solves and stabilizes external conflicts. This is an invisible tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ming wants to operate it, and it is theoretically possible, all it takes is Wang Ling to say so, and it will be done.</p>

    <p>He immediately sent instructions to Tiandaoyun, asking Tiandaoyun, as a miracle of the universe, to cooperate with all the work proposed by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Serving an ordinary person. This is not the original intention of Tiandaoyun. But this is the meaning of Wang Ling. So Tiandaoyun itself has to do it.</p>

    <p>As for the subsequent task arrangements, Wang Ling also has a general understanding.</p>

    <p>After all, Tiandaoyun is a miracle of the universe. It is not a real cloud disk. Even if Wang Ming coordinates the process, there may still be a certain degree of risk in forcing the intervention to break the wall.</p>

    <p>This must be done beautifully. It must also be done quietly. The team at Mixiu's Emperor cannot get any clues.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming immediately thought of another person.</p>

    <p>That is Bai Qiao, who is engaged in game development.</p>

    <p>Since {Cultivation Simulator} has been well received, Bai Qiao has actually been working hard to develop his next top-notch masterpiece.</p>

    <p>Just a while ago, the large-scale stand-alone game {Itinerant Immortal} she developed has officially completed its phased testing. It has not yet been directly made public. Wang Ming feels that it is the perfect medium to serve as a medium to protect the Tiandaoyun.</p>

    <p>In other words, in the end, all the Mixiu monks who are restricted by the wall of spiritual consciousness will enter this game and use their own strength to break the wall of spiritual consciousness.</p>

    <p>This is a situation broken by the Mixiu monks themselves. It is expected that Mixiu's Emperor will not be able to find any other loopholes or handles.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Sun family's ancestral land, the second restoration work on the second map of the ancestral land, Ice Purgatory, has begun again. With the experience of the previous restoration, Zhenyuan Immortal is obviously more skilled this time, and the progress is faster than the last time.</p>

    <p>Because the modeling to restore the ancestral land has already been archived. It can be taken out and used again. There is no need to recalculate.</p>

    <p>Er Qiao's injuries were basically cured by Sun Rong. But Mr. Sun, the boss, was still in a deep sleep... It was the {Little Sleeping Technique} personally performed by the Immortal Zhenyuan. This is one of the branches of Heavenly Dao magic. It can put qualified practitioners into deep sleep for 24-72 hours.</p>

    <p>All in all. Another strange spell derived from Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>The main reason is that she is worried that after Boss Sun wakes up, if something happens to the newly repaired ancestral map again, Boss Sun's heart may not be able to bear it.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, {Little Sleeping Technique} was taught to Zhenyuan Immortal by Wang Ling. It is a concentrated Heavenly Dao spell separated from {Great Eternal Sleeping Technique}.</p>

    <p>The power of {Great Eternal Sleep} is obviously greater. It can make qualified practitioners sleep for 2.4 billion to 7.2 billion years...</p>

    <p>Well, that means he will soon be asleep forever.</p>

    <p>Basically, after waking up from sleep, no one is there.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling will not easily perform this skill, nor will he easily teach it to others. Of course, in the eyes of Wang Ling, this Heavenly Dao skill is quite useless to him.</p>

    <p>There is basically no chance to use it. Secondly, even if there is a chance to use it, for those powerful dragonborns, this Heavenly Dao, which is very similar to a spell, will probably be ineffective.</p>

    <p>Their realm is higher. They also have the ability to compete with Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling is strong not simply because of Heavenly Dao. It is because he has a variety of Dao abilities at the same time. He can also reproduce them skillfully. After learning and using them.</p>

    <p>Under Sun Ru's guidance, Wang Ling passed through a map of Zhang Zudi as gently and quickly as possible. He was extremely fast and did not make any stops. Even if he encountered Dao Ancestor Wang who was suspected to have stayed behind on purpose. He didn't even pick up the equipment. He didn't bother to pay attention to it. He moved forward all the way. Just to verify the truth in his heart.</p>

    <p>"This is it."</p>

    <p>Finally. On the forty-ninth map of the Sun family's ancestral land, within the space of all phenomena, the huge Broken Finger Mountain comes into view. Before the Broken Finger, this mountain should have five fingers. Now, this The thumb of the mountain is broken. It crosses between the jungle ahead. It is covered with moss and has obscure inscriptions of the Ancient One.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling moved with the wind. He moved directly sideways. Just under the foot of Broken Finger Mountain, he saw a golden coffin.</p>

    <p>"This is the place where the remains of the ancestor are kept..." Sun Ru looked distracted. Even though it was only the second time she came here to worship, the excitement in her heart was self-evident.</p>

    <p>Thinking of the first time she came, she was not qualified to stand in front of him at all. She just looked up from a distance.</p>

    <p>Now she was brought to such a close location by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Facing the golden coffin in front of him.</p>

    <p>Now, it's time to reveal the truth...</p>
