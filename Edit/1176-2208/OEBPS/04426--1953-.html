  <h1>Chapter 1953: How can I punish the senior brother?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The manager next to the mine owner looked like a rich man and spoke extremely arrogantly about the sponsorship of the sect competition.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and others then realized that Haoren Peak had taken out a loan to participate in the sect competition...</p>

    <p>"You guys need to know that cultivation is always hard work. Don't look at the hard work in this mine. In fact, it requires the most physical strength and patience. If you dig out a fire spirit stone of good quality, there will be additional Bonus. That manager Ma looks fierce, but he is actually not such a bad person." The good senior brother said to the Wang Ling three people with a sincere look on his face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling The three of them looked at each other. They all had the same intuition. That was that this senior brother was probably being raped by the manager of the mine.</p>

    <p>And why is this routine of taking out a loan to participate in a sect competition and then being deceived into working part-time because the money is not paid so familiar?</p>

    <p>You must know that any loan carries interest. And the wool comes from the sheep... Just by digging the fire spirit stone to pay back the money, you will never be able to pay back the snowballing interest of the other party.</p>

    <p>However, the senior brother also said a way. That is to unearth high-grade fire spirit stones of excellent quality. However, being able to unearth such high-grade fire spirit stones really depends on luck.</p>

    <p>In a mine, the areas where high-grade spiritual stones can be excavated are generally deep in the mine. Even in shallow layers, there is a certain probability of shipment, but this is very slim.</p>

    <p>Now several of them are arranged to mine in the shallow layer. It is obvious that the black-hearted owner of this mine did this deliberately. In this way, they may not be able to pay off the sect's debts after digging here for a lifetime.</p>

    <p>Don't mention it. Wang Ling thinks this script arrangement is quite educational.</p>

    <p>You can get a loan, but first you have to measure your repayment ability. If you have no source of income, you definitely can't take this path. Secondly, you must go to a formal banking institution to be more reliable.</p>

    <p>If you meet a shady lender, you won't be able to bear the snowballing interest. Those living in Amway, the real world of cultivation, are often ruined by shady loans.</p>

    <p>Without any training, Wang Ling and others started working in the mine just with the guidance of the good man Feng Senior Brother.</p>

    <p>The props the mine owner gave them were a bamboo basket and a mining pick.</p>

    <p>They kept knocking for a long time. Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan were covered in sweat. However, they found nothing.</p>

    <p>Mining in the real world is too difficult. It is not as easy as they imagined. If it is in the game, just click the mouse on a certain place.</p>

    <p>"Our main task should be to revitalize the sect and win the sect competition, right? Why did you come to mine? And it consumes too much energy. Will we still have enough energy to fight on the day of the sect competition?" Li Changzhe used team communication Technique. Take the initiative to speak to Wang Ling and Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan deeply agrees with this.</p>

    <p>She felt that this situation was very wrong.</p>

    <p>Originally, because the three of them were working together on a collective mission, the starting sect was already weaker than the others.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling felt comfortable. He joined the wealthy Wuxiang Peak. They clocked in to work in suits to recharge their batteries... They actually wanted to go to the ground to mine. What's the point of this?</p>

    <p>Therefore, the top priority right now is to pay off the sect's foreign debt as soon as possible. Only when they are freed from work in the mines will they have more possibilities.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling naturally thought of this.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the environment here is dim. There is gray smoke emitted by the Fire Spirit Stone everywhere. Under the cover of the smoke, Wang Ling quietly applied a layer of temporary "Great Luck Technique" to the mining picks of Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>He hasn't used this Heavenly Dao spell for a long time. Because such an extreme spell will seriously destroy the game's balance. But now it's for a battle of wits and courage with Teng Luchen. At the same time, it's also to relieve the current deadlock. Wang Ling had to resort to such means.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the spell was finished, Li Changzhe swung the mining pick and struck it with the next blow.</p>

    <p>"Nail!"</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a crisp sound of impact on the rock wall, a red-gold spirit stone about the size of a basketball appeared in the gap in the rock wall.</p>

    <p>It emitted a dazzling light. Li Changzhe was shocked: "It's... shipped! The best fire spirit stone!"</p>

    <p>These are not high-grade fire spirit stones. They are the best among fire spirit stones! One piece is worth ten high-grade fire spirit stones!</p>

    <p>The senior brother of Haoren Peak was also shocked. According to the contract signed before, as long as eight high-grade fire spirit stones are dug in exchange for the commission, the sect's foreign debt can be paid off.</p>

    <p>Now this top-grade fire spirit stone not only allows them to pay off their foreign debts, but can even make a small profit from the black-hearted boss.</p>

    <p>"Junior Brother Li...you are really lucky." The senior brother was shocked. Because according to the original script, they will complete the collection of eight high-level fire spirit stones tomorrow. Everything is designed in the script.</p>

    <p>However, Li Changzhe has now overfulfilled his task. This makes the senior brother of Haoren Peak completely unable to deal with him.</p>

    <p>At this time, the eyes of everyone in the mine were attracted by the appearance of this top-quality fire spirit stone.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that Zhang Linyan would also ship goods at this time!</p>

    <p>And it was pure golden light. It was far more shining than the one Li Changzhe dug up!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the whole mine was in a panic. Not only the senior brother of Haoren Peak, but also the mine manager and mine boss who came to inspect the work were confused. They were just confused.</p>

    <p>Damn it! The ultimate fire spirit stone!</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, the value of this fire spirit stone is one level higher than that of the best fire spirit stone. It is exuding golden light! And after the light dissipates, the entire fire spirit stone appears to be a diamond version of the material. The red stone There is an indescribable transparency in his body.</p>

    <p>This natural beauty attracted everyone's attention in an instant. Many people fell unconscious when their mining picks fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>This ultimate fire spirit stone is worth as much as 100 ultimate fire spirit stones!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, in front of the surveillance camera of Jiutian Jingmi Courtyard, Teng Luchen was also stunned.</p>

    <p>He quickly turned to look at the staff on the side: "What's going on with this shipment rate? Didn't I ask you to set up a guaranteed mid-level fire spirit stone for every 100 knocks? How could they complete it so quickly? Debt repayment work?"</p>

    <p>This is the thinking of most card game companies now. They provide a guarantee, but they cannot give it completely. They must give players the feeling of giving a sweet date with a stick, so that the Kryptonians can continuously add money into it.</p>

    <p>According to Teng Luchen's original plan, he wanted to exert pressure in such an extreme environment. Let's see the true level of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now, everything has been broken by Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan's sudden good luck.</p>

    <p>He was reprimanded. The staff was also very aggrieved: "Teng Lao... we don't know where the problem is! Logically speaking, the shipment rate of the best fire spirit stone is very small. It can only be struck 100,000 times with a mining pick. The ultimate fire spirit stone must be struck at least 1 million times before it is guaranteed... Their luck is really scary!"</p>
