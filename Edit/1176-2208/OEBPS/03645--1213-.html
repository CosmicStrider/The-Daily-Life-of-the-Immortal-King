  <h1>Chapter 1213 Hard Currency</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At noon, Wang Ling received a large box of things. These were all prepared by Chen Chao and the others. Although Wang Ling saw the condolence list last night, when so many things were placed in front of him I still feel dizzy when I do it.</p>

    <p>There are all kinds of things in the box. But there is no elixir.</p>

    <p>Everyone's mind is like a mirror. Sun Rong's own family produces elixirs... Maybe the chicken blood tonic elixirs you buy in the market are produced by the elixir-making company under the Huaguo Shuilian Group. So I gave you the elixirs. It doesn't make any sense.</p>

    <p>The gift Xia Ming gave was a USB flash drive. He knew that Sun Rong actually had a bad image of him. So he took out the video of the last duel between himself and Wang Ling and took out all the things he had been beaten about. The scenes were cut out separately to make a ghost video.</p>

    <p>What Li Youyue prepared was a love lunch box. All the food was packed in antiseptic and insulated lunch boxes. You could smell a fresh fragrance through the lid Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao gave two women's pink dumbbells as a gift. They showed his true nature as a straight man. However, these things may have been what Chen Chao subconsciously thought was the best gift.</p>

    <p>The thing Guo Hao sent was quite special. He carefully selected a seven-color butterfly in the cocooning state from his spiritual animal shop. This silkworm chrysalis was next to the branch of the incubator. It seems that it has the meaning of breaking out of the cocoon. The beautiful meaning of butterfly is.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi and Wang Zhen have just arrived on Earth. Apart from working for Lord Diulei, they don't have much savings. And they don't know what to give to Sun Rong. So these people come from outside the Earth. The experts worked together to buy hundreds of masks.</p>

    <p>It's flu season. Masks have become hard currency. Front-line medical workers are in short supply. The daily consumption is huge.</p>

    <p>These people were able to buy these masks with the salary they received from Lord Diulei and Wei Zhi. This is already a huge sum of money...</p>

    <p>Everyone sent something. Wang Ling felt that he would be a bit stingy if he didn't send anything. He thought about it for a long time. Finally, he made up his mind and stuffed two packs of original crispy noodles into it.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of others, the value of crisp noodles is definitely not as good as the current masks. But in the eyes of Wang Ling, this is the hard currency that can be exchanged with him for everything.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Wang Ling took out the storage bag prepared in advance. Put all the supplies in this box into it. Now we are ready to hit the road.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Mother Wang threw a cotton mask far away to Wang Ling: "Put it on when you go out! The urban area is not like that in Jiulong Mountain. It is very strict now. Although you are indeed different from others. But You still have to wear a mask."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was about to ask Mother Wang what made him different from others. Mother Wang's next sentence made Wang Ling speechless: "Others are afraid of viruses. You are afraid of viruses."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This is actually no wonder Mother Wang. Because viruses in the world of cultivation are indeed terrible. Especially in the era of universal cultivation, it is most likely to produce that kind of super virus.</p>

    <p>Once the virus is produced in the body, the test is the self-recovery ability of the cultivator, because ordinary pills are not effective at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is different.</p>

    <p>The blood flowing in his body has the ability to self-clean. Viruses will be killed if they are inhaled into the body... And when Wang Ling is walking on the street, his whole body is simply like walking to purify the air. device.</p>

    <p>So the mask that Mother Wang gave to Wang Ling is just to prevent Wang Ling from being stopped when taking transportation. In fact, this mask is very breathable and will not hinder Wang Ling's breathing.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "The flu in Songhai City has been very serious these past two days. Others are just making contributions by staying at home. You have strong abilities and great responsibilities. If you have nothing to do, go for a walk on the street to purify the air."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Taking the Spirit Bus on the way to the hospital where Sun Rong is located. Wang Ling saw that the streets were indeed under martial law. There were far fewer people traveling.</p>

    <p>The reason why we took transportation there was that Wang Ling was deliberately delaying time. The time now was just at noon. Sun Rong was probably still eating there.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks that he should use the teleportation technique to cross paths.</p>

    <p>He was afraid that he would be left there to eat together. So he would rather delay the trip. It was already two hours before he arrived at the Qixing First Military Medical Hospital in Songhai City. Wang Ling According to the address Guo Hao inquired about, he got there from the hospital. Enter through the south entrance.</p>

    <p>Through the large ornate iron gate Wang Ling, I suddenly saw the snow-white building behind me that didn't look like a hospital at all.</p>

    <p>From a distance, it looks like a castle where nobles live.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stayed at the door for a moment. An old guard wearing a mask came out of the security room: "Young man, who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>After he asked this question, he looked at Wang Ling up and down. Finally, his mind suddenly shook: "Aren't you that... that... what's your name... Oh, by the way! You are that A Grain of Ash in Time!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is necessary to upgrade his shielding technique.</p>

    <p>Although people can't call out his name under the influence of the Great Shielding Technique. But the problem is that they have found other nicknames to replace his name... Being called "A Grain of Ash in Time" every day is too outrageous. Angry!</p>

    <p>"Are you Miss Sun's classmate? Miss Sun has greeted me before. As long as there are classmates coming today, we will let them go." The old man smiled and patiently explained the route to Wang Ling: "Young man, you Go in along the main road. It's the first building. It's the first room on the first floor."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Before I could say thank you, the old man had already opened the big iron door.</p>

    <p>He had just stepped forward when he heard the old man say from behind: "This classmate doesn't need to worry too much. As far as I know, Miss Sun's health is not serious. She is here just to live and play. Miss Sun lives here." That building is full of recovering patients. There will be a doctor's meeting in the afternoon. No outsiders will pass by. And the soundproofing is very good! No one will notice anything you do!"</p>

    <p>"???" Wang Ling felt like this old man was hinting at something.</p>

    <p>When I walked to the door of Building 1, a mechanical eye poked out from the door. This is a medical detection mechanical eye. When the medical staff are not around, there will be a mechanical eye on duty to guide, deliver medicine and disinfect entrances and exits. Work.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt like his body was illuminated by a purple sterilizing light.</p>

    <p>Then, the mechanical eye quickly moved out of the way and guided him to the ward of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>When I came to the door of the room, Wang Ling saw a quiet girl, wearing a light blue hospital gown. She was leaning half sideways and looking out the window with some boredom.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that the girl did not want to stay in the ward.</p>

    <p>But as the future successor of the family, it is also her responsibility to obey orders.</p>

    <p>The sound of footsteps startled Sun Rong's ears.</p>

    <p>The girl turned back. At this moment, her eyes met Wang Ling standing at the door.</p>
