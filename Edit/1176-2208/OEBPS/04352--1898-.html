  <h1>Chapter 1898 Beat Jingzeâ‘¡</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It's hard to imagine. The palm is only as big as a baby. It looks as soft and waxy as cotton. But in fact, it is really merciless when it hits people.</p>

    <p>This small slap caused Jingze to move backwards for a hundred miles in the core world. His whole body slid on the ground with his face directly plowed out an abyss.</p>

    <p>It was just a simple slap. Jingze was already dizzy from the slap. A trace of fear finally appeared on his face. It was a fear originating from the depths of his soul.</p>

    <p>Because this slap was so familiar to him. It was like a memory engraved in his bones since the last slap, making it difficult for him to forget.</p>

    <p>When he got up from the bottom of the abyss, even though Jingze had tried very hard to convince himself that the other party was just a little baby and there was no need to be afraid at all, his body could not stop trembling.</p>

    <p>As a result, Jingze suddenly erupted. He used all his spiritual power to fully open his dragon wings. The crystal clear keel showed a rich luster under the swirling thunder and lightning.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan knows clearly that this is a kind of fear. Even though she is not old, she still has the ability to perceive emotions. And everyone faces fear in different ways. Jingze's apparent explosion is actually a cover-up. He roared and charged at the front, spreading thunder to every corner of the core world.</p>

    <p>During the roar, one after another Thunder God Whips broke out of the ground. Tens of thousands of Thunder God Whips broke out of the ground. They were like tentacles, swinging back and forth throughout the core world.</p>

    <p>"The power of the old world?" Leng Ming frowned. His masters had previously warned him to beware of the resurgence of the old world. This was also the focus of Jingke and Bai Qiao's previous training for Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>As the future successor of the Sword King Realm, Leng Ming studied very seriously at that time. He also had a certain degree of understanding of the knowledge of the old world.</p>

    <p>It was a mysterious and terrifying history. It symbolized darkness and devouring. No one would hope that the power of the old world would resurface in a peaceful era.</p>

    <p>Not only the modern world of cultivation, but also the Sword King Realm and other realms need to beware of the emergence of this power. The biggest symbol of the old world is the mysterious tentacles. Wang Nuan had eaten a few of them herself before... It doesn't taste good.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, they had done their homework in advance. Neither Leng Ming nor Wang Nuan had any fear in their hearts. They thought that Jingze's outburst would come up with something more interesting. In the end, it was only at this level. Wang Nuan was very disappointed.</p>

    <p>As a younger sister, she wanted to surpass her brother, but her brother was too strong. It would take an unknown amount of time for her to surpass Wang Ling based on her talent... The key was that as she grew, her brother would grow too!</p>

    <p>If both people grow, when will the gap catch up?</p>

    <p>So Wang Nuan's goal is very clear. Although she was only born less than a few months ago, her small body already has big ambitions! She has thought very clearly. To surpass her brother. The only way is to keep fighting so as to win the championship. Strengthen herself in battle!</p>

    <p>The Dragonborn should be considered a good opponent. But what disappointed Wang Nuan was that the Dragonborn she faced was the first Dragonborn besides Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, what he resorted to at the critical moment was still such an inferior method. He can be described as a bastard.</p>

    <p>If you just look at Wang Nuan and look down on Wang Nuan, and think that you can defeat Wang Nuan with a weird magic that transcends Wang Nuan's age structure, then you would be a bit underestimated of the youngest of the Wang family.</p>

    <p>She is the Lord of Shadow. Wherever there is light, there is shadow. And using shadow to counterattack is Wang Nuan's best method.</p>

    <p>The electric light released by Jingze actually created excellent environmental conditions for Wang Nuan. She took her time, riding on Leng Ming's neck, and began to use all her spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The surface of the core world emerged. Countless pitch-black tentacles protruded from the ground. These were the shadows engraved by Wang Nuan. Their power was equivalent to these lightning whips. At the moment of generation, they formed the same shape as the tentacles summoned by Jingze. Reciprocated suppression.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Nuan took advantage of the checks and balances and struck again.</p>

    <p>"Yaya!"</p>

    <p>Only this time, what touched Jingze's face was Wang Nuan's little feet.</p>

    <p>The moment this little flying kick hit, the huge force formed directly exploded in Jingze's face, distorting the void and completely tearing open the space.</p>

    <p>The seemingly innocuous flying kick was actually too violent. At that moment, Jingze felt as if his face was swept by a huge mountain. He flew away in the air immediately, vomiting blood. His eyes were filled with an unbelievable look.</p>

    <p>So strong...</p>

    <p>Even Leng Ming was stunned. Although he knew that Wang Nuan was very strong, he never expected that Wang Nuan could be so strong and domineering.</p>

    <p>For a time, as Wang Nuan's sword spirit, Leng Ming felt that he was under a lot of pressure.</p>

    <p>Unknowingly, he has been involved.</p>

    <p>In order to become a sword spirit worthy of Wang Nuan, Leng Ming felt that he needed to work harder.</p>

    <p>"Ahem..." Jingze got up from the ground for the second time. This was the second time he was attacked in the face. He was covered in blood. He looked in very bad condition. The dragon wings on his back were broken. Even the dragon scales were damaged. Wang Nuan caused several bald patches.</p>

    <p>He kept coughing up blood, but the expression on his face still showed no sign of giving up.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Nuan also had no intention of letting Jingze go.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Muyu was injured. Although he drank a lot of tonics, Wang Nuan felt that it was difficult to relieve her anger after just two blows.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after beating Jingze twice, she was actually waiting for Jingze's injuries to recover. After all, with the Starlight given by Bai Zhe, Jingze's injuries could be healed quickly.</p>

    <p>And this is excellent news for Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Because Jingze's rapid healing symbolizes two things.</p>

    <p>One thing is that it can make her play more heartily.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, points are also a very special way to gain combat experience.</p>

    <p>Although Jingze is not strong, his health bar is thick enough!</p>

    <p>Although the strength is too weak, as long as the body is strong enough, it can barely be considered as an opponent.</p>

    <p>So Wang Nuan calculated that Jingze had almost recovered, and took action again. The endless spiritual energy in her body exploded at this moment, and turned into endless thunder! This was the method she learned from Jingze using Shadow's ability.</p>

    <p>This is the true way of giving to others in return.</p>

    <p>"Thunder and lightning are ineffective against me." Jingze laughed. He laughed at Wang Nuan for actually trying to use thunder and lightning against him.</p>

    <p>But soon, he was slapped in the face again by Wang Nuan at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>Because the next second, the headbutt mixed with the power of thunder hit him again. And it was still aimed at his vital parts. He was hit accurately on the spot...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Jingze felt as if his body was struck by thunder. He screamed in pain instantly.</p>
