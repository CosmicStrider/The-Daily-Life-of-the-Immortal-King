  <h1>Chapter 1316 Controlling Wang Nuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know why. A good prairie dog wants to die.</p>

    <p>And he also surprisingly discovered that his unborn sister seemed to have the attribute of "brother controlling."</p>

    <p>After all, Ah Nuan went berserk after hearing the marmot's cry.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling feels extremely melancholy.</p>

    <p>The former brother controlled Wang Xiaoer. The latter brother controlled King Ah Nuan...</p>

    <p>The DNA of their Old Wang family is truly amazing!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Able to launch a shadow riot on the far side of the moon from such a long distance.</p>

    <p>Only the founder of Shadow can operate with such skill.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has learned Shadow, it is true that he is not as proficient as his sister.</p>

    <p>After all, this is what Ah Nuan learned in the womb. And there are many new features that have not yet been released.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only learned a rough outline. It is far from reaching the essence.</p>

    <p>Learning the Way and fully integrating the Way are two different things.</p>

    <p>My sister is very strong!</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling feel happy in his heart!</p>

    <p>When Wang Nuan grows up, he may have no shortage of opponents to practice with!</p>

    <p>The groundhog is still struggling.</p>

    <p>His body was completely restrained by Shadow. He was tied to the back of the moon and could not move.</p>

    <p>"You brothers and sisters are really useless..."</p>

    <p>The word shameless hadn't been uttered yet. The marmot's mouth was immediately sealed by a shadow again!</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan controls well." Wang Ling gave high praise to Wang Nuan's operation.</p>

    <p>Although his sister has not yet been born, she is obviously a natural fighting talent!</p>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling felt the tacit understanding between them as brother and sister.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan is control.</p>

    <p>He is the output!</p>

    <p>It's so convenient to work together!</p>

    <p>Now. This groundhog is resurrected at full status. Wang Ling knows that he will definitely not be able to deal with the opponent with an ordinary palm strike.</p>

    <p>And now the chaotic gray mist on the opponent's body has returned to its peak.</p>

    <p>Therefore, continuous blows are necessary to kill this prairie dog.</p>

    <p>So consider all the circumstances.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling begins to accumulate power.</p>

    <p>Because the groundhog has been controlled by Wang Nuan. This provides Wang Ling with a lot of time.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>About ten seconds later, a red light emerged from Wang Ling's palm and then covered the entire palm.</p>

    <p>A god-destroying blow.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure that this groundhog can be exterminated. Wang Ling showed such a palm technique for the first time.</p>

    <p>This is the condensed power of Three Thousand Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling was condensing, the surrounding space was shattered with one blow. Countless thunders of divine punishment appeared and exploded crazily all around.</p>

    <p>"Not good..." At this moment, the groundhog felt a real scalp numbness!</p>

    <p>This palm is extremely powerful!</p>

    <p>Even if he is protected by the chaotic gray mist, he may not be able to survive it!</p>

    <p>You have to find a way to break free!</p>

    <p>At this time, the prairie dog was racking his brains to think of a way to escape from the confinement of the shadow.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, he heard a faint cry coming from the universe.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is accumulating strength while looking for the source of the cry.</p>

    <p>He began to think it was a prairie dog crying.</p>

    <p>It turned out not to be.</p>

    <p>Finally he found the owner of the voice. It turned out to be the spirit of the moon.</p>

    <p>The moon spirit shed tears in pain. He was extremely frightened: "Ling Zhenren. On the surface, I have a lot of holes... I just suffered a penetrating wound. With your palm, this woodchuck is gone. I also It's gone!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was slightly startled when he heard this.</p>

    <p>This is considered a mistake on his part.</p>

    <p>He has forgotten that there is such a thing as a planet spirit...</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling raised his left hand again and pointed in the direction of the moon.</p>

    <p>The entire moon lit up with a "buzz" sound. Suddenly it turned into a huge red moon!</p>

    <p>Moon Spirit: "Ling Zhenren this is?"</p>

    <p>This is "permanent enlightenment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used this move to strengthen the moon. It turned into a "super moon!"</p>

    <p>Considering that we may have to drag some difficult enemies out of the earth to fight in the future. Wang Ling feels that the surface of the moon seems to be quite suitable!</p>

    <p>So he used permanent enlightenment on the moon!</p>

    <p>Let the surface of the moon become solid. It will not be easily destroyed by the power of your own palm...</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>Bad. It may still be broken!</p>

    <p>But since it has been enlightened.</p>

    <p>Then when you clean up the battlefield, just repair it.</p>

    <p>Although it has been "strengthened" by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, the moon spirit stared at Wang Ling. Still feeling frightened.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's palm "God-Destroying Blow" accurately hit the back of the moon!</p>

    <p>Before the groundhog could scream, the moon spirit was already screaming.</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist was furious: "Why are you yelling so loudly?"</p>

    <p>Moon Spirit: "Hit me. Even if I don't break, it still hurts!"</p>

    <p>The huge palm print, covering tens of thousands of hectares! Even the palm prints on the palm were infinitely magnified in an instant. The overwhelming destructive power was directed towards the back of the moon!</p>

    <p>Groundhog. Once again shot to pieces...</p>

    <p>Under Wang Nuan's powerful control, he simply couldn't break free!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And at the same time. Buddha Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>The girl saw this unprecedented battle near the moon through the Office of Strategic Deception's satellite.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is still very good." Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>Although I can't understand the atmosphere of the scene, but just from the picture analysis, it is obvious that the prairie dog is not an easy enemy to deal with.</p>

    <p>"I heard that this groundhog is a mythical beast. It is stronger than any cultivator on earth except Master." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Where's Senior Jin Deng?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"It's said to be a tie."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said with a smile: "However, as long as we wait for Master's sister to be born, I'm afraid there will be one more person on earth who cannot be defeated by this groundhog."</p>

    <p>"I heard about it before. My classmate Wang Ling's sister!" Sun Rong said with a smile: "I also have a sister! But in fact, my sister is not a relative. Only she herself doesn't know. I've been thinking about whether I should tell her the truth."</p>

    <p>"No matter if they are close or not, as long as the relationship is good enough, they are still good sisters. Sun Rong, the school girl, is so smart. She will definitely find a good way to deal with it." Wen Yan. Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I will."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. Then she suddenly asked: "Ah, by the way, Senior Zhuo! What do you think Sister Wang Nuan will like?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought for a moment and quickly raised his head: "Quick-frozen dumplings?"</p>

    <p>"Quick frozen dumplings?"</p>

    <p>I am very surprised by this answer. Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure they're not quick-frozen dumplings with crispy dough fillings?"</p>

    <p>"Sure. It's just ordinary quick-frozen dumplings..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help but laugh: "What do girls like? Sun Rong's schoolmates should know better than me."</p>

    <p>"No!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head firmly: "The DNA of the Old Wang family is so amazing. I really can't figure it out..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi smiled evilly in his heart.</p>

    <p>There is a saying: What kind of bicycle do you want?</p>

    <p>He felt.</p>

    <p>Sun RongSchool girl can send herself there...</p>
