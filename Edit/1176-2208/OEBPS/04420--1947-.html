  <h1>Chapter 1947 A new way to make money by working</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling... Why did you suddenly change positions?" Looking at the scene in front of her, Jiang Yingying couldn't believe it. At this moment, her mentality was completely shattered.</p>

    <p>She spent all her belongings to get closer to Wang Ling. Unexpectedly, not only did this wish not come true, but she became further away from Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying's heart was shattered. She looked at Wang Ling packing his things and preparing to move them to the place in the middle of the classroom. She felt a little mixed in her heart.</p>

    <p>What the hell is going on?</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang Yingying, you'd better give up on this idea... it's all destined."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao spread his hands and said with a smile: "I really don't blame classmate Jia Jun and Wang Ling for this matter. It wasn't even Boss Sun who decided it for him. It was Teacher Pan."</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan?" Jiang Yingying was startled.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Wang Ling is very likely to play on behalf of our school soon. The position in the middle of the classroom is the part with the strongest aura of the Spirit Gathering Array. Of course, he must be given special treatment." Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"But... but he suddenly moved to the middle. Isn't it too sudden? And classmate Wang Ling has been leaning against the window. He is suddenly surrounded by people. He won't be used to it, right?" Jiang Yingying wanted to cry. No tears. She feel like she don't know what to say.</p>

    <p>"This is no problem." Guo Hao said mysteriously: "All desks and chairs will soon be equipped with partitions. This means that everyone will have independent partitions in the front, back, left and right. With partitions, it should be no problem. This is also good for epidemic prevention and control!"</p>

    <p>"If you're standing in front... how can you teach in class!"</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. The front partition has a built-in double-sided LCD screen. It can directly project the picture of the podium. Then the teacher can also observe our expressions through the night view screen on the back. It is no different from usual." Chen Chao said Added on the side.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was stunned. She had never thought that such black technology existed.</p>

    <p>Although Chen Chao and Guo Hao always looked at Jiang Yingying and Wang Ling with the mentality of watching a show. They also knew that the fierce offensive against Jiang Yingying would definitely be counterattacked by Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>But this incident happened suddenly. And there is a story. It really has nothing to do with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling's position was suddenly moved in front of Chen Chao. This made Jiang Yingying feel desperate.</p>

    <p>And even if it was adjusted back later, the desk was still going to be a black technology baffle... This also made Jiang Yingying feel desperate.</p>

    <p>Of course, this baffle is still limited to the elite class internal testing stage and is not directly open to the outside world. After all, the existence of the baffle will still cause a certain blind spot in the field of vision. The teacher cannot see the small movements of the students inside the baffle.</p>

    <p>But the students in the elite class have always had strong self-discipline. So there is no need to worry about these elite students doing some illegal things inside.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was actually very irritable. But at this time, she felt an inexplicable balance in her heart. Because she felt that adding this baffle would also be inconvenient to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But it turns out that she is still young.</p>

    <p>Student Union Office. Sun Rong made a call to Rokume Akahoko. She communicated with her in fluent Sun Island language: "Classmate Ma Jiao. Yes! I am Sun Rong. Our school has installed desk barriers. board device. So I want to ask you. Can you develop a plug-in..."</p>

    <p>"I understand. This black technology bezel has been tested internally by our school before. I happen to have a program here that allows you to freely choose to link the screen inside the bezel to other people. This way you can observe the one you like!" Ma Jiao replied.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face turned red immediately after hearing this. She never expected that Ma Jiao would express her thoughts so directly.</p>

    <p>But this feeling of being understood makes Sun Rong really feel good.</p>

    <p>Of course. Sun Rong also noticed a strange point. That is, this set of desk baffles has even been tested internally by Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, it turns out you have experienced it too." She asked immediately.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao knew everything and answered directly: "Yes. But the test results are actually very average. There are blind spots inside the baffle. Everyone is doing their own thing. The teacher is also very distressed. But black technology is indeed black technology." This baffle was developed by Wuyang Mansion."</p>

    <p>"I seem to have heard of this name!" Sun Rong thought thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>"It's the independent magic weapon research laboratory that works among various cultivation countries."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao said: "So this time they laid the baffles they designed directly in high schools. I think there is actually a problem. They have never cooperated with high school cultivation schools before."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Classmate Ma Jiao is suspicious. Maybe Wuyang Mansion is related to the group of criminals who attacked Jiutian Jingmi Courtyard before?"</p>

    <p>"It's just my suspicion. And it's still a guess without evidence. I think the possibility is very high. Because their purpose is the same. It seems to be targeting a certain high school student."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why she had a vague feeling.</p>

    <p>She feels that Wang Ling seems to have been targeted by many forces...</p>

    <p>If this is true, it will be an unprecedented and huge crisis faced by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After finishing the call with Ma Jiao, Sun Rong felt as if she had noticed something terrible again. However, at the moment, she did not have any evidence in her hand that showed that Wuyang Mansion was directly related to the attack on Jiutian Jingmi Courtyard.</p>

    <p>As an independent laboratory recognized throughout the world of cultivation and dedicated to the research of cutting-edge magic technology, Wuyang Mansion has a great reputation. It was even regarded as a competitor by Wang Ming at the beginning.</p>

    <p>As for the gang of criminals who suddenly broke into Jiutian Jingmiyuan, they have now been classified as a terrorist organization. If the Tangtang Wuyang Mansion is related to this group of people, it will be big news around the world.</p>

    <p>So the new information that Sun Rong needs now is that we must investigate the structure of the Wuyang Mansion and find out who the director is.</p>

    <p>With this doubt. Sun Rong seemed a little absent-minded all day today. In the evening, she put on the fox mask and met Jiang Yingying at the Office of Strategic Deception exclusive training ground.</p>

    <p>Both of them actually have thoughts in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Rarely, the two people who were absent-minded during the entire training process surprisingly remained silent.</p>

    <p>Finally, it was Jiang Yingying who opened the situation: "Pretty sister, you don't seem too happy today?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned for a moment. Then she replied: "My boyfriend is being followed by many people. I feel very sad."</p>

    <p>"Is it a gambling debt?"</p>

    <p>"It's not... other reasons. He's too good."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiang Yingying also sighed: "My future boyfriend's seat was changed today. I originally paid a lot of money to sit behind him. But today, when he left, he was further away from me..."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she looked at Sun Rong and asked sincerely: "Pretty sister, can you tell me. Is there any way to make money quickly?"</p>
