  <h1>Chapter 2180 The double game between reality and illusion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A dragon god skull was selected from the body of the three orthodox leaders of the Dragon Clan, Dragon God, and then spliced together into a corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu frowned. He was deeply surprised. He could directly transform the original summoned creatures inside the Chaos Device. He also perfectly embedded a piece of Dragon God's skull into the body of the corpse dragon. This was definitely not something that normal monks could do.</p>

    <p>Even he couldn't do it himself. The operation is too difficult and involves many laws and regulations. Although Wang Muyu knows the theory, there is often a big difference between theory and practice.</p>

    <p>If you are not careful during the entire process of splicing the corpse dragon, the law will collapse, causing the chaos device to be directly destroyed. Not to mention reshaping the corpse dragon in the coffin board, even the coffin board will be missing!</p>

    <p>But among Wang Muyu's current limited knowledge, he can think of two people who can do this.</p>

    <p>One is my father Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The other one, probably only Bai Zhe, the current leader of the dragon clan, can do it.</p>

    <p>Although Bai Zhe, the leader of the dragon clan, is self-proclaimed and has not been recognized by Wang Muyu. But now almost all the dragon descendants are created by Bai Zhe. Jingze, Yan?, Qiao Yanyuan... these were trained by Bai Zhe The Dragonborn who emerged as a top subordinate. Now they all follow him to the death.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, today's battle may be very dangerous."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu felt the crisis.</p>

    <p>This is the second form of the Corpse Dragon. It directly releases the breath of the Dragon God. After getting rid of the shackles of the Chaos Device itself, it breaks away from the shackles of the sealed state. It even directly takes over in his core world, turning the surroundings into a Cage.</p>

    <p>Dragon God's Cage!</p>

    <p>This is the suppression of a curse circle. It is entangled with the power of various obscure laws.</p>

    <p>In fact, even if Wang Muyu didn't say anything, Yi Jianchuan also knew how risky this battle was. As the first human being to reach the holy realm, Huaxiu Sword Master. Although he stood at the realm of dragon descendants like Wang Muyu, Corpse Dragon, and Qiao Yanyuan. But after all, I have lived for thousands of years. Thousands of years of mental polishing and tempering are all real.</p>

    <p>This curse was very dangerous, but it couldn't shake him. This was what surprised Qiao Yanyuan's clone the most.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, you still have a long way to go. This is a practice. Treat it with a normal heart. Just perform normally." Yi Jianchuan's answer was much calmer than Wang Muyu imagined. He was as calm as ever. Wang Muyu is a great inspiration.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he is worthy of being the teacher chosen by Wang Ling. He did not lose his composure in such a critical moment. He has the air of a general.</p>

    <p>Inside the carriage. Sun Rong also admired Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>"General Yi is really a sword that never grows old." She was deeply in awe of the Huaxiu Sword Master's magnanimity. Faced with such a battle where the world was collapsing and completely out of her league, he could still remain calm. This The state of mind is not something ordinary people can achieve.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, don't move here. I will fight as quickly as possible!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu yelled. He hung the Liuli Horn on his waist and decided not to retreat behind the scenes. Instead, he would fight in coordination with the Liuli Dragon God!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He transformed into an aurora. The ground beneath his feet collapsed. He rushed into the sky and started a fierce battle with the corpse dragon in its second form.</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, the aurora collapsed in the sky. Endless auras scattered like meteors all over the sky. They were the sparks caused by the friction between the two sides in the fierce fight. The speed was too fast. Fist shadows were flying. It was impossible to see the movements clearly. I saw traces of fighting all over the sky.</p>

    <p>The world collapsed. The corpse dragon stretched out its bone hand and shook the sky. Repeatedly, a divine seal fell from the sky to suppress Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu looked up to the sky. He was shocked to find that the suppression was not only aimed at himself, but also at the Sword Master sitting on the ground below.</p>

    <p>Teacher!</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu was anxious. He asked the Liuli Dragon God to grab his feet and throw him out violently. He turned into a javelin and blocked it from a distance.</p>

    <p>Like a meteor falling from the sky.</p>

    <p>There was a bang. Before the divine seal fell, the suppression was blocked.</p>

    <p>But the price is heavy pain.</p>

    <p>This is equivalent to Wang Muyu trying to save his teacher.</p>

    <p>With almost no defense, he urgently withstood the suppression with his body. This made Wang Muyu's body feel a strong sense of discomfort. For a moment, his whole body was shaking. And the glazed Dragon God in the void was Wang Muyu's Dharma form. After the main body was injured, the figure of Dharma also began to become shaky.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qiao Yanyuan's clone finally understood everything.</p>

    <p>"That's it...this is not a summoned object! It's the spirit of your Dharma!" The clone laughed wildly. The corpse dragon in the second form is too strong. And its intelligence is far beyond his imagination. It's just the wisdom of fighting. Sexually speaking, it is almost unmatched by anyone! He actually cracked things that he had never understood before with just one probing move.</p>

    <p>Everything is developing for the better!</p>

    <p>The other body sneered.</p>

    <p>He no longer retreated into the background. Instead, he chose to take the initiative and patted the injured Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>A repeat of the same trick. Summon the palms of those parallel space entities that have been swallowed up in the body. Like the Thousand-Hand Guanyin, they are densely covering Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Being attacked from both sides, one can imagine the danger Wang Muyu faced.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Use your magical power to think of a solution! Muyu seems to be unable to bear it any longer!" Inside the carriage, Sun Rong looked worried. She begged.</p>

    <p>Little did they know. Wang Ling had already made arrangements.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, within Wang Muyu's core world, the heaven and earth shook. A silver aurora penetrated from a distance in the sky. That was the law, the order, and the Tao...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Qiao Yanyuan's clone body and the corpse dragon felt the amazing power contained in this mysterious light coming from a distance.</p>

    <p>In the end, all of this materialized into a golden bullet in their eyes.</p>

    <p>"This is...Mr. Xiang's...bullet?" Sun Rong was shocked and anxious. Unexpectedly, at this critical time point, such a life-saving bullet would suddenly fall.</p>

    <p>But in the world of Itinerant Immortal, Wang Ling has already shown off to Sun Rong. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are both in the game world. So where did this bullet from Xiang Yi come from?</p>

    <p>"It's a bullet prepared in advance." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>This happened shortly after Xiang Yi chose to serve as the guest secretary of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>On that day, Wang Ling took Xiang Yi to a planet infinitely far away from the earth. He asked him to carry out precise snipers at the earth.</p>

    <p>And this golden bullet is the strongest bullet under Xiang Yi's current ability. It spanned a distance of countless light years. It was shot from the distant universe to the earth. It finally passed through layers of space and arrived in Wang Muyu's core world.</p>

    <p>This book-chasing app was recommended to me by an old book friend I've known for ten years. It's really easy to use. I rely on it to pass the time while driving and before going to bed by reading and listening to books. You can download it here..]</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In an instant, Wang Muyu's core world and the sky above exploded due to the arrival of this bullet. Countless golden laws and orders accompanied the bullets, turning into mighty waterfalls pouring down from the cracks. Qiao Yanyuan's points were divided. The body, including the corpse dragon, was directly submerged...</p>
