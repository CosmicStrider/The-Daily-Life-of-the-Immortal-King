  <h1>Chapter 1411 Fan Xing seeks death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Is there anything else of value? No matter how small it is," Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>It was not very happy in its heart. Sure enough, it was right to ask for information from Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Adding up the above messages, hundreds of thousands have been credited.</p>

    <p>However, this amount of money is still not enough for the down payment of the real estate.</p>

    <p>Housing prices are ridiculously high these days.</p>

    <p>It can only be saved temporarily. It accumulates bit by bit.</p>

    <p>Because even if Er Ha is used for investment and financial management, the risk is very high.</p>

    <p>After all, investing in oil these days is likely to result in loss of money. Nothing is possible...</p>

    <p>"Let me think about it..." Wei Zhi touched his chin and thought hard.</p>

    <p>After a moment, he had an idea: "Ah, by the way. Have you heard of Hui Feng?"</p>

    <p>"What is this?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha is puzzled.</p>

    <p>Hui Feng? Are you a fan of Gray Mist Creatures?</p>

    <p>But the groundhog who is Lord Gray Mist is still suppressed under the water tower in the central lake of the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>Because of the painful loss of the egg and forced sex change, it is still in a petrified state and has not recovered.</p>

    <p>"I just heard about this. When I was chatting with Miss Yingying last time, she casually mentioned that she joined a Gray Cult and became Hui Feng." Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"It can't be some evil religion..."</p>

    <p>"After all, Marshal Jiang is here. It shouldn't be a cult. It should be some kind of fan group." Wei Zhi replied: "Miss Yingying also said that everyone in Gray Cult is a grain of dust in the times."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Er Ha finally realized it.</p>

    <p>"A grain of ashes in the era." Famous scenes will last forever.</p>

    <p>This essay was written at the Jiulong Mountain Sports Conference. It is still included in the National High School Student Essay Library and will soon be published as a book. It will become an essay in the {National Excellent Essay Selection}.</p>

    <p>The classmate Wang Ling who was mistaken for the original author will soon receive a one-time royalties of about 3,000 yuan for this reason.</p>

    <p>However, since this can be regarded as using "ability" to make money, Father Wang directly contacted the publishing house and asked them to donate the money directly in the name of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>So now based on what Wei Zhi learned about the situation, Er Ha suddenly felt that Wang Ling was a little pitiful.</p>

    <p>If Jiang Yingying really likes Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. How will it end then?</p>

    <p>In the evening. Sun Rong had been thinking about Jiang Yingying after finishing her homework.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er comforted her. "Rongrong, don't think too much! Maybe they are here to study! And I don't think you need to worry at all. Ling Zhenren is just a piece of wood. You can't shake her. How can she Jiang Yingying You can succeed so easily?"</p>

    <p>She secretly thought that these words could comfort Sun Rong. But in the end, it made Sun Rong even more uncomfortable...</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>If only Wang Ling wasn't a piece of wood!</p>

    <p>At this time, the phone on the table vibrated. Sun Rong received a message from Er Ha.</p>

    <p>The above are all the information about Jiang Yingying that Er Ha obtained from Wei Zhi. As well as Er Ha's speculation on this matter.</p>

    <p>"So, classmate Jiang Yingying might like, in fact, senior Crispy Noodles Dao Lord?" Sun Rong stared at the message above. The originally dull mood seemed to ease a lot.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha's speculation alone doesn't seem to explain anything...</p>

    <p>After all, from Jiang Yingying's subjective point of view, she does not know about the essay in the Jiulongshan National Physical Martial Arts Competition. The real original author is not Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So how to sort out the misunderstandings is what Sun Rong needs to do now.</p>

    <p>Originally the girl thought this was just an ordinary competitor...</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the situation turned out to be far more complicated than she imagined!</p>

    <p>"There is no other way. It seems that we can only break into the enemy first and understand the intelligence more deeply." Sun Rong thought for a while and muttered with a frown.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong wants to join that Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"This is the only thing we can do now." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>But this matter won't be rushed for a while.</p>

    <p>For Sun Rong, she still has the task of replacing the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Around eight o'clock in the evening. Er Ha appeared at Sun Rong's bedroom door on time.</p>

    <p>The girl is ready.</p>

    <p>The fourth Rubik's Cube is located in another secret realm in the universe called the Ageless Star.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready, boss?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for the hard work on today's information Er Ha. The money will arrive tomorrow!" Sun Rong smiled: "Let's do it quickly! I have more important things to do when I come back!"</p>

    <p>She is already familiar with the task process of "Replacing Rubik's Cube."</p>

    <p>As long as there is no riot in the Rubik's Cube, there is almost no risk in the Rubik's Cube collection mission. As long as she takes Aohai with her.</p>

    <p>And this trip back. Aohai is the standard for quad-core!</p>

    <p>One core is "Alluring Sword"</p>

    <p>The second core is the "sword that conquers the world"</p>

    <p>The three cores are "pour the ball and strike with a sword"</p>

    <p>And the quad-core is..."Pour the Ball and Sword PLUS!"</p>

    <p>Aohai in the three-core state can already destroy the earth. And with four cores... it can destroy larger planets that are less than 100 times larger than the earth!</p>

    <p>At the same time, in a Xinxing apartment building one hundred kilometers away from Sun Rong's home.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of satellite monitors here.</p>

    <p>After a burst of snowflake signals, the picture finally settled on the villa where Sun Rong lived.</p>

    <p>Two technicians were adjusting the satellite image: "Master, the signal fluctuated briefly just now. It is normal now."</p>

    <p>Behind them, a long-haired young man in a suit and tie sat back on a wide leather reclining chair. He crossed his feet on the table and frowned slightly: "When will the eyes of heaven be able to see into my sister's bedroom?"</p>

    <p>The owner of this Xinxing apartment is none other than Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>He is the landlord here.</p>

    <p>The entire apartment building is his territory.</p>

    <p>Since his recovery, he has been thinking about a revenge plan.</p>

    <p>These days, the pain he suffered in the Sun family villa... every time Fan Xing thinks about it, he feels depressed in his heart, as if there is a congestion of blood in his heart.</p>

    <p>But it seems he didn't deserve to die.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know what is going on...</p>

    <p>His body fully recovered in a very short period of time and reached a normal level of health.</p>

    <p>Even the doctor who treated him said that this may be a miracle in the history of cultivation medicine.</p>

    <p>"Master, I don't know why. There is always a very strong magnetic field in Miss Sun's bedroom. Maybe Boss Sun has sent experts to protect her? Our satellite signal has never been able to penetrate. It is also for this reason."</p>

    <p>"A master? What a master? The master in my sister's villa. I know how much it weighs. Even the cultivators of Soul Formation can easily peek into this celestial eye I set up!" said Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>His original intention was to secretly take some private photos of Sun Rong and then spread them through the Internet. But now it seems that this road does not seem to be smooth.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason. Sun Rong A Foundation Building period... Besides, this is still in the bedroom. How could there be an expert lurking in a girl's bedroom?</p>

    <p>Could it be that her sister became a True Immortal level master in a few days?</p>

    <p>This is unscientific!</p>

    <p>"Forget it. It's been carried out according to the original plan." Fan Xing sighed and waved his hand.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Master." The technician nodded. They began to remotely mobilize the Sky Eye.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing's Sky Eye satellite also has the ability to summon meteorites. It can use scientific means to absorb nearby meteorites, and then intelligently twist the meteorites to a specific orbit to accurately strike the target.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>His purpose is to blow up the entire Sun family villa, and then destroy Sun Rong with it...</p>
