  <h1>Chapter 1571 Wang Nuan is about to be born?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk's head contains the power of the Tribulation Transcendence.</p>

    <p>The moment Fenmu Shen crushed his round head, the brain inside instantly boiled and was released along with the power of calamity that had been accumulated for a long time.</p>

    <p>The monk deliberately let Fenmu Shen pinch his head. He wanted to kill Fenmu Shen by self-explosion. But this idea was always too naive.</p>

    <p>Under such a big explosion, Fenmu Shen still remains standing in the universe. He has a mysterious mark of vicissitudes and simplicity on his body.</p>

    <p>This was brought from the heavenly tomb!</p>

    <p>After seizing Peng Xiren's body, he obtained benefits from the Sky Tomb that the world cannot understand.</p>

    <p>Among them, it also includes the ancient Dao seal on this body. Fenmu Shen still remembers that this was an ability that Dao Ancestor Wang showed when he fought against him.</p>

    <p>At first I thought it was a magic spell, but in fact the essence of this ancient seal was also a chaotic object.</p>

    <p>They have spiritual intelligence. Once they obtain their inheritance, as long as they think about it, they will wrap around their whole bodies like reptiles, making Fenmu Shen's whole person majestic.</p>

    <p>When standing face to face with it, Monk Jin Deng could even feel that what he was fighting was not a living being... but most of the universe!</p>

    <p>"Monk, you are not dead yet. Come! Fight again! I have obtained countless divine objects from the sky tomb. I can show them to you one by one." Fenmu Shen laughed. He was extremely arrogant.</p>

    <p>He didn't take the monk seriously at all. In his opinion, the monk Jin Deng was just a tool he used to test the new magic weapon in his hand.</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A dozen feet in front of Fenmu Shen, a ball of past Buddha fire appeared. It gradually condensed into the shape of a monk.</p>

    <p>"Eh? The breath has actually increased?" Facing the newly emerged monk, Fenmu Shen had a slightly playful look on his face.</p>

    <p>After being tempered by the fire of the Buddha in the past, the monk was born out of the fire. The cassock on his upper body was peeled off and turned into flower-like fragments lingering around him.</p>

    <p>At this time, his upper body was exuding golden Buddha light. A powerful aura of the most holy Buddha was accompanied by the three Buddha fires of the past, present and future, forming an opposition to Fenmu Shen at this time.</p>

    <p>Golden body mode!</p>

    <p>This is an ability that a monk has never used before.</p>

    <p>Because this is a method that comes at the cost of burning your own reincarnation cultivation. It should not be sacrificed easily.</p>

    <p>"Is the Earthly Ancestor aura... No. It's not there yet. It's still a little bit close." Fenmu Shen sensed the power emanating from monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, a jade Buddha head appeared in his palm.</p>

    <p>This is also another divine object discovered by Fenmu Shen in the sky tomb.</p>

    <p>"Monk, you are the sage of Buddhism. Do you know what this thing is?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen sneered.</p>

    <p>The monk's golden eyes moved slightly. Then a powerful energy burst out from his body.</p>

    <p>The immovable golden body actually cracked the moment he saw the jade Buddha head!</p>

    <p>"Monk...you are still young after all."</p>

    <p>He expected that the monk would react when he sacrificed the jade Buddha head. However, he did not expect that the monk would destroy his immovable golden body for such a Buddha head.</p>

    <p>The sage of Buddhism is nothing more than this.</p>

    <p>In fact, this Jade Buddha's head is no other, it is the skull of the monk Jin Deng's teacher from one of his lifetimes who passed away. This person was also a friend of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>After the eminent monk died, Dao Ancestor Wang sacrificed the eminent monk's skull to make this jade Buddha head, and buried them together in this celestial tomb.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen is knowledgeable about the past and the present. After identifying the origin of this jade Buddha head, he concluded in his heart that it was the life gate of Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>I never thought that when I used it at this moment, the effect would be surprisingly good.</p>

    <p>The next moment, a huge explosion erupted in the universe.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng held up the cracked immovable golden body and released endless Buddha light. In an instant, he gave birth to the sound of endless avenues, which resounded throughout the universe.</p>

    <p>The sound wave spread. It spread to countless light-years away...</p>

    <p>Even Fenmu Shen became excited.</p>

    <p>He has been suppressed by Dao Ancestor Wang for too long. It has been too long since he has experienced a hearty battle.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't pay attention to the monk in front of him at all.</p>

    <p>But he also enjoyed the monk being tortured by him. His face showed pain, struggling and then roaring...</p>

    <p>Just like the guardian of the Heavenly Tomb...</p>

    <p>After all, everything is just dust in the universe.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, above the earth, in Songhai City at this time, there was thunder initiation. Large clouds covered the sky, as if it was about to collapse.</p>

    <p>Especially near the Wang family's villa. Father Wang looked out the window and saw countless thunder striking the ground, creating pits in the ground!</p>

    <p>Many big trees far away from the villa were damaged. They were split in half!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was resting in the courtyard. After seeing such a scene, he shrank his neck and slipped into the villa.</p>

    <p>This thunder... is so unusual...</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt instinctively. This seemed to be a difference in the universe, resulting in a butterfly effect.</p>

    <p>This is not a natural thunder. Nor is it a thunder of punishment from heaven.</p>

    <p>Although it was very subtle... Er Ha could clearly feel that there seemed to be an inaudible energy of chaos in the thunder.</p>

    <p>Because he had personally experienced the pain of being surrounded by thunder mixed with the power of chaos in order to be promoted to a divine beast.</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong hadn't taken action at that time, it would have almost been taken away!</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Fortunately, the Wang family villa was enlightened by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There are countless other enlightened spirits inside. This thunder of chaos cannot reach here for the time being.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha still had a vague sense of foreboding.</p>

    <p>"The child's father..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang was preparing dinner, but at this moment her figure suddenly became unstable and she almost fell down. Er Ha quickly flew over and transformed into a human form to support Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>In the end, she was able to hold on. Er Ha felt like she was almost crushed to death by Mother Wang!</p>

    <p>Because Mother Wang's weight is amazing... far beyond Er Ha's imagination.</p>

    <p>Could it be that it's the weight of Ah Nuan girl in this belly?</p>

    <p>"How are you, mother?" When Father Wang rushed over after hearing the news, he saw Er Ha taking the initiative to place himself under Mother Wang. He also took a breath of air...</p>

    <p>Mainly because it was also the first time for Father Wang to see Er Ha in human form. The key was that she was not wearing anything.</p>

    <p>Just lying underneath Mother Wang. It's really a little bit vulgar...</p>

    <p>But he didn't blame Er Ha. Instead, he was somewhat grateful to the family dog.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Er Ha was here just now!</p>

    <p>Father Wang took the initiative to go over and support Mother Wang. His arms were strong. Er Ha breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"Why can you be so relaxed..." Er Ha changed back into the dog form. The dog's head was full of shock.</p>

    <p>"Before Ling Ling went abroad, he specially treated my arms. Now we also have unicorn arms." Father Wang said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang checked on Mother Wang's situation.</p>

    <p>Immediately, his brows furrowed and he said, "I can't help it...the amniotic water has broken! Ah Nuan is about to be born!"</p>

    <p>"It's time to give birth?" Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>Although it was almost 10 days ahead of the previously predicted delivery time, there was nothing that could be done since the little girl was eager to break out of her shell.</p>

    <p>Due to previous experience in dealing with the birth of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This time, Father Wang was extremely well prepared!</p>

    <p>"Old Wang's house! Level 1 red alert! All monsters act according to the original plan!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang hugged Mother Wang tightly and began to assign tasks to all members of the Wang family's villa: "Also. Go and ask Lord Ma to invite Immortal Toya here!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the refrigerator in the kitchen shook slightly.</p>

    <p>As waves of cold air were released from the refrigerator, the refrigerator door slowly opened in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Er was shocked!</p>

    <p>Because inside this double-open refrigerator, after some modifications, there is actually an operating room hidden inside!</p>

    <p>"Sterile operating room. Ready."</p>

    <p>The enlightened refrigerator now emits an electronic sound that is neither sad nor happy.</p>

    <p>I'm really giving birth...</p>

    <p>At this time Er Ha. The mood in my heart is fluctuating.</p>

    <p>And I thought of something that might happen...</p>

    <p>It knows. Now the monk is fighting with that Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>And Ah Nuan girl actually chose to break out of her shell at this time...</p>

    <p>It feels like this is no coincidence.</p>

    <p>Is this girl trying to get rid of Fenmu Shen?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>Damn it! No way! No way... This is just born!</p>
