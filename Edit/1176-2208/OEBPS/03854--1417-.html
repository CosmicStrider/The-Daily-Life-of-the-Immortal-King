  <h1>Chapter 1417 Thank you from Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling deeply despises Chen Chao for his obscene behavior.</p>

    <p>However, Chen Chao soon lost his merit...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying stretched out his hand to Wang Ling. He originally planned to shake hands with Wang Ling. Instead, his hand was grabbed by Chen Chao: "Jiang Yingying, right? Hello classmate Jiang. I am Chen Chao! Yes, I am. My classmate Wang Ling is the best buddy!"</p>

    <p>Facing the familiar man in front of her, Jiang Yingying was a little disgusted at first. However, after hearing the words that Chen Chao is Wang Ling's "best buddy", she still suppressed the idea of throwing away her hand.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be classmate Chen Chao. I know you! Jiulongshan Taishu Competition. Your performance was outstanding." Jiang Yingying said with a smile.</p>

    <p>This is of course a polite statement.</p>

    <p>All her eyes were attracted by "A Grain of Ash in Time." In fact, she didn't remember Chen Chao's highlight performance at all.</p>

    <p>However, before coming to Number 60 High School, Jiang Yingying did her homework as much as possible.</p>

    <p>It's just that Chen Chao is Wang Ling's best buddy.</p>

    <p>It was her negligence.</p>

    <p>It must be recorded when you look back.</p>

    <p>This will help Jiang Yingying find out other information about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>A beautiful transfer student suddenly came over to chat during lunch time...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it's still too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>He was thinking, maybe he should bring his own lunch box to school in the future.</p>

    <p>No need for rice.</p>

    <p>This bento. Wang Ling can make it by yourself.</p>

    <p>Braised crispy noodles, crispy crispy noodles, crispy noodles in soup...</p>

    <p>Just open the bags and pack them separately. Very convenient.</p>

    <p>In fact. Wang Ling himself is also very confused.</p>

    <p>He is already so low-key. And he also deliberately made his face into a "public face" that he "thinks" he is not particularly handsome.</p>

    <p>But why can I still attract girls...</p>

    <p>Could it be that the strange DNA of the Old Wang family is really causing trouble?</p>

    <p>So. Facing Jiang Yingying in front of me.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really want to reply: What do you like about me? Can't I change it?</p>

    <p>However, there are so many people in front of me. Wang Ling cannot say anything at all.</p>

    <p>When most people in the cafeteria are single.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling this sentence is nothing more than adding fuel to the fire.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling really said it.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of many boys, this is nothing more than an act of being good to get something cheap.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling in our family doesn't like to talk. He just looks like this. I wonder what happened to my classmate Jiang?" Chen Chao expressed his enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>Although it was his first time to meet Jiang Yingying, his first impression on him was very good.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it's nothing."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying smiled. Her eyes stared at Wang Ling: "I am a fan of my classmate Wang Ling. The essay in the Jiulong Mountain Physical Martial Arts Competition really opened my eyes!"</p>

    <p>It's okay not to say this. As soon as Wang Ling said it, he understood everything...</p>

    <p>Wipe! So this girl is apart of the "Crispy Noodle" pot!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head and pretended to eat. The other hand reached under the table to make calculations.</p>

    <p>I quickly understood the ins and outs of everything.</p>

    <p>And the real purpose of Jiang Yingying transferring to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Asking for advice does not exist.</p>

    <p>Fall in love...</p>

    <p>It's even more impossible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this girl Jiang Yingying's intentions are in the wrong place.</p>

    <p>Let's take a step back 10,000 steps.</p>

    <p>Even if you are in love...</p>

    <p>That must also be in accordance with the Basic Law.</p>

    <p>There is no one who has just transferred to another school and rushes to get a position.</p>

    <p>"The food in the cafeteria of Number 60 High School is not bad. The sweet and sour pork today was very good! Wang Ling Do you also like eating meat?" Jiang Yingying had just sat down for a few seconds and was ready to start looking for topics.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, "Sima Zhao's heart is well known to all."</p>

    <p>Anyone who is not a fool can see Jiang Yingying's intentions.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao felt sour again.</p>

    <p>I don't understand what's so good about Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Why are all the girls willing to hang around him?</p>

    <p>Can't you think about him?</p>

    <p>And faced with the problem of Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling continued to remain silent.</p>

    <p>He looks calm on the outside but panics inside...</p>

    <p>As good brothers, Chen Chao and Guo Hao read Wang Ling's helpless eyes.</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you, Ms. Jiang, that's the way the Wang Ling is. Don't be offended! Are you from Jian Shen Academy? I actually want to ask you, what happened to your captain Yi Zhiyang? " Chen Chao tried to intervene to change the subject.</p>

    <p>However, Jiang Yingying could only see Wang Ling: "Wang Ling. Can you still eat it? I haven't touched the meat. I still have it here!"</p>

    <p>The so-called eating without talking or sleeping without talking.</p>

    <p>A man who doesn't speak and keeps his head buried in his food. He's so handsome!</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was full of joy.</p>

    <p>Not angry because Wang Ling didn't answer her question and remained silent.</p>

    <p>On the contrary. She thinks Wang Ling is a dedicated boy!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling read Jiang Yingying's inner thoughts. I was so shocked that I almost dropped my chopsticks.</p>

    <p>Who will save him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the student union office. Sun Rong is enjoying his lunch.</p>

    <p>She actually wanted to go to the cafeteria to eat with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But because it is too easy to cause commotion. For the sake of safety and order, there is no way around it.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>At this time, a very urgent voice came from outside the office door.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong raised his head. He saw Li Youyue from Class 2 rushing over with a hurried look on her face: "Something bad is going to happen!"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue slapped Sun Rong's desk with a big slap. The bowl of soup on the table shook and turned upside down.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter? Speak slowly." Sun Rong took out two pieces of paper and wiped the soup flowing on the table..</p>

    <p>Li Youyue exclaimed: "Your Wang Ling husband is going to be snatched away by someone else!"</p>

    <p>"You... don't talk nonsense..." The girl suddenly blushed.</p>

    <p>"Hey! Last time I helped you to make love bento, I thought that you two could make it! In the end, I found out that you two are so slow..." Li Youyue revealed a disappointed expression, she spread her hands and sat down: "Classmate Wang Ling is just a wooden head, and you're not. Directly grab him and throgh him against the wall, it's not over!"</p>

    <p>"You haven't told me yet. What do you mean by what you just said? What do you mean, being snatched away by others?" Sun Rong was puzzled. He was so calm that he picked up the soup bowl and took a sip of soup. At the same time, he was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>In fact, she probably knew what happened.</p>

    <p>But the more times this happens, the less likely I am to show panic.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, wouldn't it be a joke to others?</p>

    <p>"He's a transfer student! His name is Jiang Yingying! He came to the school to register today. He's eating with Wang Ling in the cafeteria right now!" Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>As a good best friend, of course she has to be outspoken.</p>

    <p>"It's just eating. It's okay. Can classmate Wang Ling still ignore her?" Sun Rong said with a calm smile.</p>

    <p>"You are so calm..." Li Youyue felt a little incredible.</p>

    <p>She originally wanted to observe the girl's anxious reaction. As a result, the girl's calm attitude in the face of danger was far beyond her expectation.</p>

    <p>I saw Sun Rong taking out his mobile phone. It seemed that he had sent a message somewhere.</p>

    <p>Then he started eating his meal calmly.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue didn't understand what Sun Rong did. Under the girl's gaze, she walked to the window of the student union office. Then she saw Jiang Yingying walking out of the cafeteria with a panicked look on his face.</p>

    <p>"What did you do?" Li Youyue felt a little incredible.</p>

    <p>"Do you know Gray Cult?" Sun Rong asked calmly while holding vegetables.</p>

    <p>"Gray Cult? That newly established literary exchange sect among students? It seems that they are all fans of Wang Ling's composition?" Li Youyue replied.</p>

    <p>Gray Cult culture has become popular on the Internet recently. Although she is not a member of the sect, it is impossible that she has not heard of it.</p>

    <p>"I just issued a decree to send her away." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>"Deree?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. Because I am the leader."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong answered calmly and with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Why are you the leader..."</p>

    <p>"Just give money. Isn't it easy to be a leader?" Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is the position of the leader of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>She had already won it during self-study in the morning.</p>

    <p>She calculated that Jiang Yingying would most likely carry out such a surprise attack.</p>

    <p>So I took precautions in advance.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect it to come in handy...</p>

    <p>Bite!--</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong's phone suddenly vibrated.</p>

    <p>She received a text message from Wang Ling: Thank you.</p>

    <p>Although the content of the text message was as concise and concise as ever.</p>

    <p>But the girl's inner joy is self-evident.</p>

    <p>This is the first time Wang Ling. I took the initiative to send a text message to her...</p>
