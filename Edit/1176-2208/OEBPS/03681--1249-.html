  <h1>Chapter 1249 The Speculations of the Son of the Void</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the name of testing the "baldness virus", it was actually an action to investigate the void creatures lurking among the earth's cultivators in Huaxiu. Under the arrangements of Zhuo Yi and Sun Yiyuan, it was carried out in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>All parts of the country have formed the first front line in the fight against the epidemic. Currently, Songhai City has the largest number of virtual spirits.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sees that the number of confirmed cases continues to grow.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, there were clearly only more than 1,200 cases. By evening, there was already an extra zero at the end.</p>

    <p>On the Internet, people are panicking about the new "baldness virus."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the class group and saw Chen Chao, Guo Hao and others openly discussing this matter.</p>

    <p>There is no teacher in this group. It is a group created by the students in the class.</p>

    <p>"I heard that our school will have classes tomorrow. I don't know if it's true or not."</p>

    <p>"Don't get too happy too soon. Studying will continue even if classes are suspended! Teacher Pan will definitely assign a lot of homework!"</p>

    <p>"Hey, it's better for teachers to stay at home. Masks are out of stock. I can't even buy them!"</p>

    <p>"There are still some people who secretly raise the price. It's shameful! It's just one or two yuan more expensive. It's outrageous to be dozens of yuan more expensive!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There are bound to be complaints.</p>

    <p>After all, the emergence of the baldness virus has disrupted everyone's normal life rhythm.</p>

    <p>Although staying at home is really comfortable for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But this is not the peaceful life he wants.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling has stepped in.</p>

    <p>He hoped that this matter could be over as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Calculation based on the population of Songhai City. The Book of Sage Immortal conservatively estimates that the number of Hollows currently lurking in Songhai City is no less than one hundred thousand.</p>

    <p>And the purpose of these ethereal spirits lurking in the dark that has not yet caused a major riot is also very simple.</p>

    <p>They are looking for the Son of the Void.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what conditions should be met to become a son of the void.</p>

    <p>But for now, this is the source of stabilizing all virtual spirits.</p>

    <p>As long as the Sons of the Void are not discovered for a day, these void creatures will not make much movement.</p>

    <p>"Can you deduce the Son of the Void?" Wang Ling stared at the tablet on the table.</p>

    <p>So far, they have obtained data on two void creatures in total.</p>

    <p>One is in the mental space of Wang Ling. The one killed by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>The other one was killed by Zhuo Yi together with Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao has shared that memory with Jingke. It is convenient for Wang Ling to drive the Sage Immortal book for data calculation.</p>

    <p>But obviously, the data of the two void creatures seems a bit reluctant for the book of Sage Immortal: "Report to the Lord. I can only try as much as possible. This is the first time I understand the creatures on the other side of the Void Gate." I don't know much."</p>

    <p>"Okay."Wang Ling felt like laughing inside.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he rarely saw the Book of Sage Immortal shriveled.</p>

    <p>Among all the monsters I have enlightened, this iPad alone feels like I have a high IQ. I often act smart and even decide some things for myself.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling had long planned to send the Book of Sage Immortal. If it hadn't been for this void invasion, I'm afraid this thing would have been delivered by his courier long ago.</p>

    <p>But this time, the search time for the Book of Sage Immortal did take a long time.</p>

    <p>During this period. Wang Ling also did a lot of additional things.</p>

    <p>He did a set of {35} exercises;</p>

    <p>After watching what I was following, I voted for the monthly recommendation vote;</p>

    <p>I used my small amount of pocket money that was deducted by Father Wang to donate to a trustworthy charity...</p>

    <p>"Report to the Lord. I have basically completed the search. Judging from the current search results, the Son of the Void that Void Spirit is looking for is actually preparation for invasion. There should be two real Sons of the Void. Both of them are It is the key to opening the gate to the void. Both are indispensable." The book of Sage Immortal answered.</p>

    <p>"What is the purpose of the invasion..." Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>These virtual spirits think they are superior to others, but they want to invade the earth. This is an incredible thing in Wang Ling's view.</p>

    <p>"37% probability is to occupy the earth."</p>

    <p>"The 31% probability is to transform the earth into a void breeding farm. It will be used to breed void creatures in batches for the void spirits to devour."</p>

    <p>"The 23% probability is that they want to use the earth as a bait. Disguise themselves as humans, lure other advanced creatures to attack the earth and then devour those advanced creatures. In order to pursue higher forms of life."</p>

    <p>"Judging from the memory retrieval of the two dead void spirits, the void creatures behind the door believe that their current form is still not perfect. They feel that they can go further and evolve upward."</p>

    <p>"There is a 9.9% probability that he wants to attract Heavenly Dao's attention."</p>

    <p>"Less than 0.1% probability remains. It may be to kill a short and skinny author."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "But no matter what the purpose of their invasion is. Open the door to the void. This is a critical step they must do. Because even the Lord of the Void does not have the ability to break the door."</p>

    <p>"Don't have the ability to break a goal?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha, who had been lying on the ground, smiled: "Isn't the world behind the door their own home for them? Will they feel disgusted staying in their own home?"</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "The world behind the door is paradise for ethereal spirits. But if you stay in paradise for a long time, you will always feel tired. You want to go out to seek new excitement."</p>

    <p>"This is just like the students who are suffocating at home during the epidemic and looking forward to the day when school can start."</p>

    <p>"You have to abide by the regulations and rules at home. Although you don't have to worry about food and clothing, you have to be cautious every day. At the same time, you have to be careful not to talk back to your elders... So after going out, it is the same for Xu Ling. A way to free myself."</p>

    <p>This reason sounds a bit true to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He felt like it was a reflection of reality...</p>

    <p>Of course, everyone has different ideas. Some people may want to take a few more days off. Some people hope to resume work and school as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>But no matter what kind of thoughts they have, everyone has the same idea. They hope that this unnecessary disaster will pass as soon as possible and that everyone can live a safe and healthy life.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "To sum up, according to the information obtained so far, there are currently six people who are most suitable to be selected by the Void Spirit as the Son of the Void. The probability of these people is almost 50-50... I still need More virtual spirit sample data to support."</p>

    <p>Then. The book of Sage Immortal reported the following four names.</p>

    <p>There are actually a few people here who have heard of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Gao Tianming, the captain of Number 1 High School of Fu Mo when your lord participated in the Jiulong Mountain National Physical Martial Arts Competition."</p>

    <p>"Jiang Xiaoche. Personal secretary to Sun Yiyuan of Huaguo Shuilian Group."</p>

    <p>"Xiang Haitao. General manager of Songhai Xiang's Waste Recycling Technology Co., Ltd. Xiang Haihua's eldest son. He has a long-term cooperative relationship with Sun Yiyuan."</p>

    <p>"Yi Zhiyang. A freshman at Jian Shen Academy. He is also the captain of the Jiulong Mountain Competition. The adopted son of the Sword Master Yi Jianchuan."</p>

    <p>"All men?" Er Ha discovered a key point.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "Although the information I have compiled so far shows that the two Sons of the Void are most likely male. But if the probability of adding a female is added, one person is indeed more suspicious."</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "The eldest granddaughter of Sun Yiyuan of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. Sun Rong."</p>
