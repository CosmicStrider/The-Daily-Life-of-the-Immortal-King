  <h1>Chapter 1434 The Dharma of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Galaxy Fist is extremely powerful. When it is activated, Wang Ling can clearly feel the feeling of resonance throughout the universe.</p>

    <p>He was worried that the monk would not be able to withstand the blow, so he took action.</p>

    <p>And the breath he blew, although he did not use all his strength, was definitely more than enough to withstand the frontal impact.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Ling never expected was that Peng Xiren's {Galaxy Fist} would actually be as weak as a candle. In an instant, it turned into a wisp of smoke and disappeared.</p>

    <p>A bit weak...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is completely different from what he imagined.</p>

    <p>Of course. The upper limit of Galaxy Fist is actually quite high.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a power-charging type of boxing.</p>

    <p>As long as Peng Xiren has enough time, he might be able to charge up a punch that can hurt him.</p>

    <p>After all, the universe is really too big.</p>

    <p>Boundless.</p>

    <p>Surrounded by countless stars, Peng Xiren gathered the power of the stars and condensed energy from the starlight. It can be said to be inexhaustible.</p>

    <p>In the inn in the Sword King Realm. Wang Ying replaced Wang Ling here to broadcast the scene.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>So I just used a kind of {shadow imaging}. 4K, ultra-high frame rate, smooth movement, zero delay... The only disadvantage is that the picture becomes black and white.</p>

    <p>It makes Er Ha feel like watching an old black and white movie.</p>

    <p>The monk Wang Ling personally went to help. As for the Sword King Realm, with him and Jingbai here, nothing will happen.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was once again shocked by this scene: "Why does it feel like I blew a mouthful of birthday cake?"</p>

    <p>"It's already amazing to be able to counteract the commander's blow. Otherwise, this breath would have gone directly through the air and hit him." Wang Ying folded his arms and said.</p>

    <p>"So. The ancestral realm is actually very strong?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Ying nodded: "There are not many people in this world who are in the ancestral realm. Even the masters of the God's Domain have not been able to take this step. Only the Gu family has some signs of it. Although such a realm is Extraordinary. But compared to the Lord, it's still not good enough."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Previously. Wang Ling and Wang Ying were worried about the problem of Infinite Galaxy.</p>

    <p>Due to their lack of understanding of the Infinite Galaxy, they thought Peng Xiren was a little too powerful because he was a master worthy of breaking the seal of Talisman.</p>

    <p>After seeing the results now, two huge words flashed through their hearts: That's it?</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha sighed: "It seems. This Peng Xiren is going to die."</p>

    <p>"uncertain."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying shook his head: "The Lord has no intention of killing him, because there are still many things he wants to ask him. Besides, after all, this is a master of the ancestral realm. I am afraid there are many ways to resurrect him."</p>

    <p>"Yes..." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>At this time, a question suddenly appeared in the dog's head.</p>

    <p>It is indeed normal for people like Peng Xiren to have life-saving skills.</p>

    <p>However, no matter how difficult it is, can Bai Zhe still be difficult to deal with?</p>

    <p>God knows what Bai Zhe will think of himself in the future. He will force himself to cause trouble...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the extraterrestrial galaxy. As the Galaxy Fist was calmed down by Wang Ling in one breath, the nearby space temporarily fell into deathly silence.</p>

    <p>"It's you..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren looked in horror at the figure that suddenly appeared in front of the monk like a ghost.</p>

    <p>The corners of his eyes twitched. He couldn't believe the scene before him.</p>

    <p>The {Galaxy Fist} that I condensed was extinguished by the opponent without any effort...</p>

    <p>This is something Peng Xiren didn't expect.</p>

    <p>Although he has long known that Wang Ling is very strong.</p>

    <p>Definitely a strong man above the ancestral realm...</p>

    <p>But now. Peng Xiren feels that he still slightly underestimated Wang Ling's true combat power.</p>

    <p>Although. What the monk said earlier was very slight.</p>

    <p>But Peng Xiren still heard it.</p>

    <p>He heard what monk Jin Deng said: Welcome the immortal king.</p>

    <p>Immortal king...</p>

    <p>What kind of realm is this?</p>

    <p>After Dao Ancestor. All realms have an ancestor character.</p>

    <p>And Dao Ancestor is the beginning of the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>But in Peng Xiren's knowledge, there is no realm called the immortal king.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this is another level beyond the ancestral realm?</p>

    <p>How is that possible!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren frowned slightly. He didn't want to believe all this.</p>

    <p>However, in front of him, this man with delicate features and dead fish eyes was standing in front of him. He did not exude the slightest breath from his body. Just standing here made Peng Xiren feel an inexplicable pressure.</p>

    <p>"How brave. You actually proclaimed yourself the Immortal King... My master is not as conceited as you." Peng Xiren stared at Wang Ling. Starlight gathered in his hands. It seemed that he was trying to gather the second blow of "Galaxy Fist" .</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has already noticed it, but pretends not to know.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this punch didn't actually pose much of a threat to him when it didn't have enough energy.</p>

    <p>Immortal King...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, this is just a title.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Wang Ling himself doesn't know where his limits are.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, when he was born, his realm steadily increased every two years... But after that, the rate of increase in his realm got out of control.</p>

    <p>And until now, even Wang Ling himself doesn't know how many realms he has broken through. Sometimes, the breakthroughs are even made unconsciously.</p>

    <p>While sleeping, while studying, while squatting on the toilet, while eating crispy noodles, while voting for Ku Xuan...</p>

    <p>A breakthrough may occur at any time.</p>

    <p>And the strange thing is that every time he breaks through, he doesn't need Tribulation Transcendence.</p>

    <p>Completely different from other cultivators.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling doesn't know if it's because of his amazing natural bones. Or maybe it's because of the calamity that he doesn't dare to provoke him at all...</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>While he was dazed, Peng Xiren rioted again in front of him. He condensed his divine power in his hands. While accumulating power, he solidified the dharma seals on his arms!</p>

    <p>The two star dragon markings seemed to be awakening. They suddenly jumped out from the upper arm. Then they wrapped themselves around Peng Xiren's forearm. The dragon body coiled around and finally formed a spiral muzzle!</p>

    <p>"It seems that this is the complete form of Galaxy Fist..." The monk was surprised. He didn't expect that Peng Xiren had the ability to transform magic into weapons.</p>

    <p>The Galaxy Fist fired in this form will be even more powerful!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was very proud. Full of confidence: "Wang Ling...You dare to wait for me. Galaxy·Cannon·Fist·Cannon! Have you finished charging!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spread his hands indifferently, indicating to Peng Xiren that he was free.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was irritated by Wang Ling's frivolous attitude: "You don't even show the Dharma? Are you looking down on me? Do you think you can withstand my punch with your own physical strength?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, he sighed silently.</p>

    <p>I just feel like the person in front of me is so troublesome.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that he was thinking about this person, so he didn't follow the Dharma...</p>

    <p>In the end, Peng Xiren blamed himself for looking down on him.</p>

    <p>Now that I have said that, Wang Ling feels that there is no need to be polite.</p>

    <p>Just the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>A dot the size of a grain of rice appeared on Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>At the corner of the right eye, it looks like a tear mole from a distance.</p>

    <p>"Are you kidding me? This black mole is your Dharma image?" Peng Xiren's mouth twitched as he stared at the black mole in the corner of Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>And then. There will be no more...</p>

    <p>He stared at the black mole. Suddenly he felt that the space near him was infinitely magnified. His whole mental energy felt like a trance.</p>

    <p>And the next moment, Peng Xiren's face turned pale.</p>

    <p>Because. In this black mole, Peng Xiren saw something terrible that he could not imagine...</p>
