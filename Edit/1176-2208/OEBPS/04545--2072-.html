  <h1>Chapter 2072 Wang Muyu: I was careless!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: A few minutes before approaching Yama Island, Wang Muyu felt the smell of crowds on the island. Because his true identity is a dragon. The dragon's naturally powerful perception also makes him particularly sensitive to all malice.</p>

    <p>He never showed the slightest hint of timidity. He calmly watched Yi Jianchuan wrap himself up in a water prison built with a sword energy barrier.</p>

    <p>"Teacher. So you knew it early in the morning?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu asked. He asked in a soft and cute voice that people couldn't ignore.</p>

    <p>He knew that he had been tricked again. On the artificial lake, Yi Jianchuan kindly wanted to help him find his parents. He also kept asking about the images of his so-called parents in his memory.</p>

    <p>All this care and kindness is probably just a well-planned arrangement.</p>

    <p>And Wang Muyu felt that regardless of whether this disciple was him or not, Yi Jianchuan would bring that "disciple" here in the end.</p>

    <p>There is no other reason. Just imagine. The sword master who has not accepted a true disciple for thousands of years suddenly accepted a disciple.</p>

    <p>And this is what just happened today.</p>

    <p>Just as they were about to set off, hundreds of people appeared on Yama Island who heard the news and came to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>Where did this group of people get the information?</p>

    <p>Not to mention the gathering speed is so fast. There are also some "masters" among them who are not considered masters in Wang Muyu's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, I didn't lie to you when I said I wanted to find your parents."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan said. He seemed to know from Wang Muyu's sigh what the little one in front of him was thinking: "It's just me. I do have other purposes."</p>

    <p>After all, he still told the truth to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Because he knew clearly that the little guy in front of him was unusual. If you beat around the bush, it would arouse resentment. It would be better to say it directly, which would make it clearer.</p>

    <p>Some things need to be said. Concealing them will actually become a hidden danger.</p>

    <p>"I have always suspected that someone is secretly watching." Yi Jianchuan said.</p>

    <p>"Someone is actually spying on you?" Wang Muyu raised his eyebrows curiously.</p>

    <p>He was very talented and understood everything almost instantly: "So you chose to meet me in such a secluded place today. Just to test whether the news will leak out?"</p>

    <p>"Not bad." Yi Jianchuan nodded.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that the person staring at him from behind might take action in the restricted area. But now it seems that the other party may have some scruples in the restricted area.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he chose to gather these people to ambush him at the mouth of the sea. On the surface, they were busybodies who came to join in the fun. In fact, they were instigated by others and their only intention was to ambush him.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, Wang Muyu still can't understand this situation.</p>

    <p>The place of Qingfeng Mansion is indeed secluded. Given Wang Muyu's insight, it is impossible for him to be unaware that someone is monitoring the situation there.</p>

    <p>After all, in terms of combat power, although Wang Muyu is young, he is still at the level of the universe.</p>

    <p>That is an existence that transcends levels, planes, and dimensions. Based on the current level of monks on earth, except for his father Wang Ling and his sister-in-law Wang Nuan, anyone who uses spiritual consciousness to monitor wants to completely avoid him. This is a fantasy.</p>

    <p>Unless...there is still a master like his father Wang Ling. His aunt Wang Nuan hidden on this earth!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Muyu's thoughts were racing.</p>

    <p>He even thought about the possibility that Father Wang might have given birth to a nuclear bomb outside because of his extramarital affair...</p>

    <p>After all, it is possible to completely avoid his perception. It is really rare for a being to monitor everything without any awareness.</p>

    <p>So... just when Wang Muyu was puzzled and couldn't figure out who else on this earth except a few specific people could have such a powerful spiritual scanning ability.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan slowly took out something from his white training clothes that was beyond Wang Muyu's expectation but within reason.</p>

    <p>This is something in the shape of a leaf. The reason why I say this is because you can tell with the naked eye that this thing is not a leaf at all!</p>

    <p>Because no leaf can have such a precise chip pattern. Although this leaf is extremely lifelike and as thin as a cicada's wings, the high-tech feel on it still makes Wang Muyu speechless.</p>

    <p>"Teacher. This is..."</p>

    <p>"This is. Modern cultivation technology."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Muyu discovered that he was still young after all.</p>

    <p>Although he was born in this modern world of cultivation that is full of high technology, the genes in his bones actually originated from eternity.</p>

    <p>After all, I am still limited in my thinking... I have not ruled out the infinite possibilities brought by the modern cultivation background. I just think about whether the other party is using spiritual consciousness to test.</p>

    <p>It turned out that modern cultivation technology was used...</p>

    <p>Too careless.</p>

    <p>He was careless!</p>

    <p>"This is a very elaborate camouflaged surveillance camera."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I told you before that when the sword's intention is clear, it can turn everything into a sword and ride on the wind. This principle is the same when it is used on this sophisticated modern technological equipment."</p>

    <p>The sword master said this. Then he took out something that looked like a lake crab from his clothes.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, please tell me this is..."</p>

    <p>"As you can see, this is a lake crab that looks like a lake crab on the surface. It's actually a very elaborate disguised monitor."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Jianchuan took out a mineral water bottle filled with lake water from his clothes.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's little face showed great confusion at first. Then it turned into horror: "No way... this is also a sophisticated surveillance equipment?"</p>

    <p>"You have a low level of Muyu. This time the disguise is not in the bottle itself. It is inside the bottle."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan said unusually calmly: "Have you seen the mayfly in this water bottle? This is a very exquisite disguised monitor."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Muyu was completely confused. He had no idea that the sophisticated technology of modern cultivation had actually developed to this point.</p>

    <p>"These have been discovered. There should be others that have not yet been discovered."</p>

    <p>"Then there should be no surveillance now, right?" Wang Muyu asked while carefully checking the surroundings.</p>

    <p>This time he took into account the factors of these modern technologies and directly used the ability of the magnetic dragon to release pulse waves. Under such a magnetic shock wave, even the most sophisticated technological equipment would be destroyed in an instant.</p>

    <p>"Now, I think there is no such thing." Yi Jianchuan said with half-closed eyes.</p>

    <p>At his level, it is not difficult to avoid being seen by these surveillance equipment. All he needs to do is release his sword energy and sweep across a large area around him.</p>

    <p>Qingfeng Mansion is an important venue for Huaxiu to receive international and foreign guests. In particular, the area where the ten generals often stay and rest should undergo strict and thorough inspections to ensure that there is no possibility of being monitored by foreign parties.</p>

    <p>But even in that environment, he was still surrounded by so many "very exquisite disguised monitors." That was very thought-provoking.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Yi Jianchuan even guessed that it might be the meaning of the uppermost adult. But now he used the matter of accepting a disciple to test it. The fox's tail hidden by the other party was instantly exposed.</p>

    <p>These hired people come from all walks of life. They are not organized at all. They are formed by casual cultivators.</p>

    <p>Now they are gathering on the island. After receiving the information, they plan to take action against them.</p>

    <p>Sword Masters are difficult to deal with. Therefore, among the casual cultivators on this island, there are naturally masters who can rival Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>"So teacher, are these people here for you or for me?" Wang Muyu asked curiously, staring at the crowd of people on the island.</p>

    <p>"It's not clear yet. Maybe it's a problem left by my junior brother. I just didn't expect that there would be casual cultivators in the Venerated Immortal realm on this small island today..."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan sighed: "Muyu, are you afraid?"</p>

    <p>"There is no fear in the teacher's expression. Of course I am not afraid either." Wang Muyu said without hesitation.</p>

    <p>There is indeed a Venerated Immortal on the island. Wang Muyu just has great confidence in Yi Jianchuan. I feel that this old man is very mysterious, as if he is hiding something.</p>

    <p>To say the least, no matter how bad things go, there are still acquaintances of his on this island.</p>

    <p>He saw Zhang Zhui from a long distance away.</p>

    <p>The two looked at each other from afar, glanced at each other, and smiled tacitly.</p>

    <p>Venerated Immortal?</p>

    <p>So what...</p>

    <p>The masters on this island are not just casual cultivators.</p>
