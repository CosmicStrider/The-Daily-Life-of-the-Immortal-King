  <h1>Chapter 2084 Sword Heart Fearless</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Just because you have never heard of it does not mean that you have never heard of it. Although Sword Spirit Awakening Liquid sounds like nonsense, since there is a theoretical possibility, there is also an IQ tax.</p>

    <p>Especially for modern Cultivation Malls. There are always unscrupulous merchants who like to use the brand name of well-known Cultivation University or medical family. They use a lot of theoretical knowledge that is not yet clear and use high-tech cloaks to produce those IQ tax products.</p>

    <p>Nano, quantum, which were popular back then...the Sword Spirit Awakening Liquid that is popular now, are essentially the same type of thing.</p>

    <p>Just like Juggernaut said, it is difficult to extract the active ingredients of Sword Spirit Awakening Liquid, so the cost becomes extremely high. Therefore, in order to save costs, manufacturers usually play word games.</p>

    <p>For example, first add 30% of the active ingredients to a cup of solution. Then pour the cup of water directly into the water tank. Then the entire water tank is equivalent to having 30% of the active ingredients.</p>

    <p>And this... is what Yi Jianchuan calls seawater egg drop soup...</p>

    <p>Therefore, as long as there is demand in the market, similar products will only appear in an endless stream. Eventually, those black traders will be fed up.</p>

    <p>"There will never be a shortage of people in the world who are eager for quick success...if you can't calm down, you are destined to suffer."</p>

    <p>The sword master's expression was calm. He had no interest at all in the iron-eating sharks that were being captured by the fleets of various cultivating countries. The calmness and detachment on his face showed a distinctive confidence.</p>

    <p>He even felt that what he said was not straightforward enough. After all, Wang Muyu was still young. So he used a very easy-to-understand example to explain to Wang Muyu: "Does Muyu know... Bingdundun?"</p>

    <p>"Is it the mascot that's been very popular lately, teacher?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Yi Jianchuan nodded: "Look, it's because of those who are eager for success that scalpers who buy and resell are born. Maybe this example is not quite appropriate. I hope you can understand."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Teacher." Wang Muyu laughed.</p>

    <p>The little guy is well-behaved, sensible, and highly savvy. If it weren't for Wang Muyu, Yi Jianchuan might not have known that he liked children so much.</p>

    <p>Although Yi Zhiyang was adopted by him as his adopted son... his Sword talent is higher than that of ordinary young monks. But this kid's mental stability is too poor. He can cultivate the Wuji Sword, but he cannot master the Wuji Sword. new heights.</p>

    <p>In fact, Yi Jianchuan originally thought that Yi Zhiyang was not that bad. But the more he compared with Wang Muyu, the more he discovered that the gap between people could be so big...</p>

    <p>Some children are Golden Core at a young age.</p>

    <p>Some children become autistic after a competition, and they haven't completely come out of it yet.</p>

    <p>If Yi Zhiyang heard the Sword Master's voice, he would be very desperate inside. He would almost report his ID number directly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, if he knew Wang Muyu's identity, he would feel even more aggrieved.</p>

    <p>The contrast between gods and humans...</p>

    <p>This Wang Muyu is not a human being!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Muyu, who was sitting comfortably in the cabin, suddenly felt the little white dragon in the waves they were riding on suddenly shake violently.</p>

    <p>Ahead, one wave after another turned into a sea wall and emerged. One after another, it stretched endlessly. This was a sign that something huge was emerging from below.</p>

    <p>The sea restricted area already lurks huge risks. And for a long time, this area has been bounded by the Yuan Zun of the major cultivating countries... This means that the underwater creatures here have also been extremely protected. May give birth to unimaginable giant Neptune-like spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>The immortal fleets of the major cultivating countries captured large numbers of iron-eating sharks around the abandoned fortress. The giant creature under the sea seemed to be offended. It felt like it was being disturbed, so it took the initiative to fight back.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The huge golden fin is a hundred feet long. From a distance, it looks like a folding fan under the sunlight. It is gorgeous and unreal. But at the same time, it is full of risks.</p>

    <p>Iron-eating Shark King?</p>

    <p>Judging from the fins, it is not difficult to conclude that this is the leader of the group of sharks. The iron-eating shark king.</p>

    <p>But this head is too big!</p>

    <p>What's even more terrifying is that the broad and thick fins are covered with strange, obscure and terrifying runes. There is a terrifying secret power attached to them. It is definitely not something that is restricted to the sea, or should exist on the earth today!</p>

    <p>Even if the Sea Zone is blocked by a barrier for hundreds of years, it's impossible!</p>

    <p>"This smell...isn't right."</p>

    <p>Almost at the moment when the shark king appeared, Wang Muyu, Yue Lingwei, and Zhang Zhui realized something was wrong almost at the same time.</p>

    <p>This is a power far beyond the current level of the earth.</p>

    <p>Apart from them, even Yi Jianchuan was surprised.</p>

    <p>However, what was even more surprising was that almost at the moment when he had a premonition of danger, the swordsman immediately stood up from the cockpit, pressed the emergency brake button of the maritime high-speed train, and jumped into the void from the opened top door.</p>

    <p>"Teacher..." Wang Muyu was shocked by this awe-inspiring righteousness. The Venerated Immortal realm can already sense the universe. The sword master should clearly know that what he is facing is no longer an ordinary spiritual beast on the earth. But one that kills people. Scary monster.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know how this iron-eating shark king had evolved to this point and could possess such amazing spiritual power, he was still fearless in his heart. He was righteous and faced the difficulties head on.</p>

    <p>At that moment, his body turned into golden holy light and fell from the sky. It was surrounded by endless sea water and headed towards the Shark King.</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu monk has a pure nature. It stands to reason that in such a restricted sea area, the immortal fleets of various countries were attacked. He could have just let go. But Yi Jianchuan still rushed to the front.</p>

    <p>Although the speed is already very fast, the destructive power of this Shark King is equally astonishing. The fins of the shark flipped, and several ships exploded on the sea. They were not cut in two, but the moment they were hit, they were struck by powerful psychic energy. It was directly impacted into granular fragments. It melted on the sea surface on the spot.</p>

    <p>Of the monks on several ships, only the monks on the outside managed to escape by flying into the air. The rest inside the ship were all spared.</p>

    <p>What a terrifying and ferocious psychic power...</p>

    <p>A slap. www.uukanshu.net crushed all the monks under True Immortal. They didn't even bleed. They all instantly turned into dust and ashes along with the hull.</p>

    <p>In the face of absolute power, it seems that the most advanced modern cultivation technology is a vulnerable toy. Everyone has seen such a terrifying giant spiritual beast. Especially one with unseen eternal runes on its fins. Let All the monks from different countries were stunned.</p>

    <p>In the horror, some people thought of asking for help. But the Shark King's psychic energy was too fierce. It seemed that a special magnetic field was formed around it, making it impossible for the signals of all their ships to be radiated to the outside world.</p>

    <p>"It was Qiao Yanyuan...he did it."</p>

    <p>Inside the maritime high-speed rail. Wang Muyu looked at this scene.</p>

    <p>He could see that the runes of the iron-eating shark emperor that had evolved to a terrifying level... were the marks of the dragon clan!</p>

    <p>Could it be that Qiao Yanyuan's dragon-born ability can super-evolve designated creatures?</p>
