  <h1>Chapter 1556 Zuan Ziying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the hearts of all local islanders of Sun Island, cherry blossoms are a symbol of holiness and beauty.</p>

    <p>The status is naturally extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Even ordinary cherry blossoms will still make people here feel respectful.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the pot of seven-wheeled purple cherry blossoms brought by Sakai Toyotoshi.</p>

    <p>Give the seven-wheeled purple cherry blossoms to Wang Ling. When he said these words, Sakai Toyotoshi knew that he seemed to be a little exaggerated.</p>

    <p>After all, his real intention was not to send Ziying away.</p>

    <p>He secretly took out this pot of purple cherry blossoms from the glass incubator at home. He used a civet cat-for-prince trick. But the pot now placed in the glass incubator is a fake.</p>

    <p>Teenagers in high school are immature mentally. They like to show off things that others don't have in front of others. Sakai Toyotoshi is no exception.</p>

    <p>And whenever he wants to show off, he will use fake ones to replace the real ones and show off the real ones.</p>

    <p>After satisfying my own vanity, I exchanged the pot for the real purple cherry blossoms.</p>

    <p>Of course. If his father knew about this, Sakai Toyotoshi felt that his legs might not be saved.</p>

    <p>After all, this is the Seven-wheeled Purple Sakura...</p>

    <p>A baby with a market value of 200 million.</p>

    <p>And it's the kind that will definitely sell as soon as it's listed. It's easier than selling a house.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>That was just a sarcastic remark.</p>

    <p>Even if the purple cherry blossoms are about to bloom, they won't bloom now.</p>

    <p>Although the purple cherry blossoms bloom randomly a hundred years later, there are also basic rules for blooming.</p>

    <p>It is winter in December. Ordinary cherry blossoms have no shadow. And the rare purple cherry blossoms cannot bloom in winter.</p>

    <p>Anyone who knows flowers actually understands this.</p>

    <p>Jisaki showed contempt.</p>

    <p>"Sakai Toyotoshi, this guy. He talks beautifully."</p>

    <p>"Obviously it was expected that it would be impossible to open in winter."</p>

    <p>"Zi Ying is so delicate. How could she open..."</p>

    <p>There was a lot of chattering around. Jisaki muttered softly.</p>

    <p>However, he just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>The purple cherry blossom seedlings in the pot suddenly seemed to be awakened by some sound. They twitched slightly...</p>

    <p>Jisaki thought he was dazzled. But the facts before everyone made him believe the magical scene he saw.</p>

    <p>This is by no means an illusion of Jisaki alone. Because Jisaki is not the only one to notice this.</p>

    <p>Gradually, people began to talk about this.</p>

    <p>"Look. Does the seedling of the Seven-Wun Purple Sakura seem to be moving?"</p>

    <p>"What? No way! It's December now! Such a cold season!"</p>

    <p>"I think I saw it right... it did seem to move just now..."</p>

    <p>"Did we talk too loudly and wake us up?"</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. The scene instantly became lively.</p>

    <p>Although the purple cherry blossom seedlings trembled slightly and then stopped moving, many people did see that movement.</p>

    <p>"It couldn't have been blown by the wind, right?" someone questioned.</p>

    <p>"It's definitely not a problem with the wind..." At this time, Sun Rong also focused his gaze on the flower seedling.</p>

    <p>Because of the relationship with Aohai's "human and sword unity", Sun Rong's six senses are infinitely amplified.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also gained a passive skill that can listen to the sounds of all things.</p>

    <p>The sea is originally an existence that nourishes all things.</p>

    <p>Nature can also listen to the sounds of all things.</p>

    <p>There was no other reason why the girl was stunned.</p>

    <p>Because she not only saw this purple cherry tree moving a little bit.</p>

    <p>She also heard the sound made by this purple cherry tree!</p>

    <p>"Neuropathy... He moves me around every day... I've been suffering from irregular menstruation from time to time..."</p>

    <p>"I can't bear it anymore! I want to change my master!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling... Brother Ming..."</p>

    <p>In the independent spirit voice channel of the team, Sun Rong seemed a little at a loss for a while.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone has the ability to communicate with all things.</p>

    <p>For most people, Purple Cherry is just an auxiliary magic weapon and a rare spiritual plant.</p>

    <p>They couldn't understand what Ziying said.</p>

    <p>But it would be different if I could understand.</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong, calm down. It's not that you heard wrong. This Ziying is indeed speaking Yingying language." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>The ability to listen to all things. Wang Ming actually has it too.</p>

    <p>He can adjust his brain waves to the corresponding frequency according to the type of creature. He also gains the ability to listen to all things.</p>

    <p>It's just that the sound is not as clear as Wang Ling, Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it. This is a very irritable purple cherry tree.</p>

    <p>Of course, this can't be completely blamed on Murasaki. After all, it has to be moved and taken out to show off by Sakai Toyotoshi from time to time.</p>

    <p>Even in this cold winter, I have not escaped this disaster.</p>

    <p>This made this seven-wheel purple cherry tree feel deeply dissatisfied with Sakai Toyotoshi.</p>

    <p>And in such a public place. When Nanawa Murasaki heard the news that Sakai Toyotoshi was going to make a bet and send her away.</p>

    <p>Qilun Ziying could no longer hold back the anger that had been suppressed in her heart for a long time!</p>

    <p>All things have animism.</p>

    <p>Especially. When Qilun Ziying sensed the faint, spiritual aura exuding from Wang Ling... it immediately made Ziying even more excited about the idea of changing ownership.</p>

    <p>"Sakai Toyotoshi!!"</p>

    <p>So. Accompanied by Ziying's last roar, which only Wang Ling could hear.</p>

    <p>The purple sapling in the pot grew up in an instant, at a speed visible to the naked eye!</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect this to be Zuan Ziying." Wang Ming couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>The growth rate of the seven-wheeled purple cherry blossoms exceeds everyone's imagination.</p>

    <p>Under the astonished gazes of everyone present, the trunk of the purple cherry tree grew rapidly. Countless branches sprouted from the center of the trunk in all directions.</p>

    <p>The purple buds are dotted like lanterns on a Christmas tree. They instantly decorate the entire cherry blossom tree.</p>

    <p>Like the most brilliant fireworks in winter, they suddenly bloomed.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>On the stage. Moriyama Kaede was dumbfounded on the spot.</p>

    <p>He stared at Sakai Toyotoshi who was also stunned next to him for a year. He scolded in a very small voice: "Sakai! What the hell is going on!"</p>

    <p>"I... I don't know either..."</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi himself was about to cry: "President... I... I think this Murasaki is playing me..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Because he really had no intention of giving away this purple cherry tree.</p>

    <p>In previous years, he showed off his seven-wheel purple cherry blossoms at home. He never failed!</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that this purple cherry blossom would bloom in the unseasonal winter!</p>

    <p>And this was after he made the decision to send her out!</p>

    <p>Isn't this an actor-level acting skill?</p>

    <p>I bet you are also the Queen of Hundred Flowers?</p>

    <p>However, at the next moment, the most shocking scene appeared.</p>

    <p>The branches of this purple cherry tree slowly stretched in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the head of the branch, there was a twin purple cherry blossom bud that bloomed when it was handed to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"This is Ziying's gift! It turns out that Houlang Sang! is really a mascot!" At this time, someone finally couldn't help but screamed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
