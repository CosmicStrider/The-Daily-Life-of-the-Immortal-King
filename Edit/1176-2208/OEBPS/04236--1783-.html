  <h1>Chapter 1783 The Domineering Boss Sun</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The hotel's dining setting is an all-Chinese buffet. Delicacies from mountains and seas, and a variety of dishes from eight major cuisines are available. In addition, there is also a specially set up creative cooking area.</p>

    <p>The few people accompanying us discovered that the essential ingredients for these creative dishes seem to be indispensable dry noodles... For example, crush the dry noodles and wrap them on the lobster. Then fry them and it becomes a new style of tempura.</p>

    <p>"Is there any other way to eat it like this..." This kind of flattery is too obvious. Chen Chao, Guo Hao and others were stunned for a while. At the same time, there was a little jealousy in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, no one would be able to withstand such fierce sugar-coated bullets from such a consortium lady. And it's not just sugar-coated bullets. They can even feel Sun Rong from these trivial details...</p>

    <p>However, the iron tree doesn't bloom, and the wood doesn't bloom. The innocent face staring into the eyes of a dead fish seems to never receive any emotional signals. It makes people anxious.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan has always been opposed to romance in high school. She believes that learning is always the first priority. Naturally, these friends from Number 60 High School can understand the good intentions of the class teacher.</p>

    <p>However, no one can talk about emotional matters. Some of them suddenly sprout and call. It cannot be stopped...</p>

    <p>Of course. Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Li Youyue and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>A few people here are not worried at all that Sun Rong and Wang Ling will be criticized by the school for their relationship issues during high school. Because judging from the current results, Wang Ling is like a piece of wood. It's a machine without emotions.</p>

    <p>It may take a long time for this emotional sowing to truly blossom and bear fruit.</p>

    <p>"When do you think they will get results?" Guo Hao asked curiously while putting vegetables on the plate.</p>

    <p>"I don't think it can be done in high school. Maybe in college?" Chen Chao guessed casually.</p>

    <p>That's all he said. No one expected that Chen Chao's casual words would actually become a prophecy later on.</p>

    <p>Several people were chatting and laughing as they kept putting dishes on the plates. Only Fang Xing's face remained calm. It was not difficult to see that he was even a little dignified.</p>

    <p>He is the only insider among the few who knows Wang Muyu's true identity. At the same time, as one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception, he naturally comes with a mission.</p>

    <p>This trip abroad. Although Chen Chao, Guo Hao, and Li Youyue were invited by Sun Rong, Fang Xing still had to pay attention to the topic of field control and guidance at any time and the safety issues of these three people during their regular itinerary.</p>

    <p>After all, the Tengu have already tried to attack Sun Rong. If they are jealous, they might also attack the classmates around Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As someone who can be personally invited by Sun Rong to travel abroad together, the risk factor for Chen Chao and others is self-evident.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Fang Xing was extremely cautious during the entire meal, paying close attention to whether there were any suspicious people around.</p>

    <p>All in all, Fang Xing was really too nervous.</p>

    <p>It's so tense that Wang Ling can even feel it.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when it started. Wang Ling found that Fang Xing was under a kind of pressure.</p>

    <p>In the memory, Fang Xing did not seem to be like this in the past. Sunshine's smile had a somewhat leisurely look. This seemed to be the appearance of Fang Xing in Wang Ling's memory.</p>

    <p>He glanced at Fang Xing with his peripheral vision. Then he walked from the cooking area to the private room. Along the way, he used the primer technique to throw a piece of chocolate filled with crispy dough crumbs onto Fang Xing's plate.</p>

    <p>Sweets. Helps relieve tense atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing stared at the special chocolate on the plate for a long time.</p>

    <p>He seemed to realize what Wang Ling meant. Then he adjusted his breathing and breathed a sigh of relief. He followed Wang Ling and walked into the private room.</p>

    <p>Just as he took a step forward, there was a crisp sound of shattering dinner plates behind him.</p>

    <p>Someone slammed the porcelain plate in his hand on the ground. He also pushed over the dessert stand on the dining table.</p>

    <p>"Garbage! It's all garbage! What kind of creative cuisine. Adding junk food flour to noble desserts...Is this how your hotel fools customers?" A burly blond foreign man spoke in a series of fast words Swearing in foreign languages.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were very poor at English. In addition, the man spoke too fast. They didn't know what he meant for a while. They only roughly knew that the man was complaining about the desserts on the buffet table...</p>

    <p>It feels like taking a listening test. And it's a hellish level of difficulty!</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling was shaking slightly while holding the fork.</p>

    <p>"Brother... forget it. We don't have the same understanding as this man. He is just here to find trouble." Wang Muyu stood on the chair next to him and gently patted Wang Ling on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>He had to comfort him, because he felt that if he didn't find a way to comfort him, not only would this man die in an ugly way, but even the earth would die in an ugly way.</p>

    <p>Several people sat motionless in the private room. Wang Ling was eating while staring at the back of the foreign man outside with King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he felt the resentment coming from behind. The man instinctively felt a chill running down his spine.</p>

    <p>But as a party who has received money to do things. Since he has received money, he has to get things done even if he faces all kinds of difficulties and dangers.</p>

    <p>"My eldest brother is still in the hospital just because he ate something from here! The kitchen in this hotel is not clean at all!" He was still yelling. There was no evidence. He was just talking and making things up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered it. This seems to be the ancestral skill of some foreigners who are good at lying. They distort right and wrong and tell lies as if they are true.</p>

    <p>And to themselves, this may not be a lie.</p>

    <p>In the recent past, I could find many examples to illustrate it. Wang Ling was too lazy to prove it. He still sat in the private room and calmed down, intending to see how things would develop.</p>

    <p>Soon, the restaurant manager of the hotel came quickly. He was a kind-hearted black-haired Asian guy. He looked very kind. After seeing the situation in front of him, he patiently explained to the man in front of him: "This gentleman. Please show your meal ticket."</p>

    <p>The man's props were complete. He quickly took out the ticket from his pocket: "It's right here! What? Do you think I'm a freeloader?"</p>

    <p>The manager looked at it and smiled: "I'm sorry, sir. The creative cuisine area you are in now is not included in the service scope of your meal ticket. In other words, you are not qualified to taste the creative cuisine. Area food."</p>

    <p>"These destroyed delicacies. We will compensate you for the original price. At the same time, please leave here quickly. The restaurant will refund all the fees you paid for this time. In the future, we will no longer accept rude customers."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" the man was furious. He grabbed the hotel manager by the collar.</p>

    <p>The hotel manager's face was calm. There was no trace of panic at all: "As you heard, Mr. Meili, you have been banned from our hotel. This is also the new arrival in our hotel. Boss Sun's instructions."</p>

    <p>"If you are still unreasonable, Boss Sun said that the hotel security self-defense mechanism may be adopted depending on the situation. In order to protect the safety of other guests, we have the right to break your legs and drag you out."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the manager looked at the private room where Wang Ling was: "Did you see it? Mr. Meili, the people in the private room are all distinguished guests of our hotel. They are enjoying delicious food. And they are pitiful, weak, and helpless..."</p>
