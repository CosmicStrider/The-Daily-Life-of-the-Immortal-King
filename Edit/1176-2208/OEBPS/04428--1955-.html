  <h1>Chapter 1955 This wave of blood loss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the three options that suddenly popped up and fell into deep thought. Although the reward for option three looked really tempting... a full box of crispy noodles. Wang Ling almost subconsciously chose three.</p>

    <p>However, at this critical moment, he still held back. Teng Luchen just wanted to see the plot of him directly confronting Wuxiang Peak after choosing three.</p>

    <p>And in this way, he is suspected of taking the initiative. And he seems to have fought just because of this. Is he a completely unpromising person???</p>

    <p>Besides, this option only says a box of crispy noodles. It doesn't say what kind of crispy noodles it is!</p>

    <p>If it was just the ordinary pepper noodles flavor, it would most likely not satisfy Wang Ling's appetite. Wang Ling is now keen on tasting a variety of customized flavored crispy noodles and special editions.</p>

    <p>Ordinary flavors have long been unable to meet Wang Ling's growing taste demands.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, did you see the choice? What choice?" At this time, Li Changzhe asked. He and Zhang Linyan did not receive multiple choice questions this time. But relying on Wang Ling's reaction, he felt that Wang Ling must have seen some choice.</p>

    <p>And it's still a very tempting choice...</p>

    <p>Even Zhang Linyan has never seen Wang Ling, who has always been low-key and silent, have such an expression. His eyes almost popped out of his head!</p>

    <p>Is it a reward for an immortal weapon, or a holy weapon?</p>

    <p>If you can get the holy weapon in this trial, it will be a real gain without a doubt.</p>

    <p>A high school student can have a sacred weapon in his hand. When you go out, you will be the most handsome kid on the street! Under normal circumstances, a high school student with only Foundation Building stage or Golden Core cannot control the sacred weapon!</p>

    <p>There is a high risk of backlash in overstepping the control of high-level magic weapons. Anyone who has some knowledge of cultivation will understand this. But this does not affect the normal use of it to show off.</p>

    <p>Of course, neither Li Changzhe nor Zhang Linyan would have thought that the thing that attracted the most attention to Wang Ling... was actually just puffed food commonly found in canteens.</p>

    <p>After agonizing over option three until the last second, Wang Ling finally didn't fall for Teng Luchen's trick and chose option two.</p>

    <p>The reward is a high-grade spiritual weapon and a third-level spell.</p>

    <p>Two more useless things for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He holds the Heavenly Dao in his hand. This already belongs to the category of super-level spells. It is no longer an existence that can be measured by level.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling doesn't look down on these things. Of course, there are other people who do.</p>

    <p>He thought it would be good to keep it with him for the time being. Then it would be good to give it away as a favor. There was also the privilege card. Although he didn't know what its use was. But judging from Li Changzhe's previous attitude, he should have this thing in his hand. It is also an important prop used to exchange for crispy noodles later.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling suddenly had an epiphany.</p>

    <p>The "junk" he got in his hands can actually be exchanged with others!</p>

    <p>As long as you have these props, you can't exchange any flavor of crispy noodles! Do you still need to go out of your way to perform the dangerous tasks in the options?</p>

    <p>After completing the selection, it was obvious that the absentees also received the follow-up script instructions. They immediately started their performance according to the subsequent plan.</p>

    <p>The bearded man named Tieyi said quickly: "I know that it will take a lot of repair resources to repair the old spirit-gathering formation of the Renzong. Now the sect competition is coming soon. We have to raise resources in a short time. I'm afraid it's not easy."</p>

    <p>"What good idea does Mr. Tieyi have?" Li Changzhe asked.</p>

    <p>"Wealth can be found in danger. I know there is a dangerous secret place...the resources there can be used at will."</p>

    <p>"Whatever you want? Is there such a good place?"</p>

    <p>"The premise is that you have to defeat the mountain guarding spirit. It is a natural spirit that guards the resources in the area. It is very strong. We have a large number of people. We may not be able to defeat them if we all attack. But someone is bound to be injured. But now In addition to resources, human resources are also key to our Hao Ren Sect. Therefore, we must use those resources without sacrificing personnel."</p>

    <p>Tie Yi said: "That's why. This is the plan for now.</p>

    <p>The best way is to bypass the mountain guardian. Many of our miner brothers were members of sects near that natural area before and are very familiar with the terrain there. If we take a small road, we may be able to bypass the mountain guardian. There is an 80 to 90% chance... The disadvantage is that once we are discovered by the mountain guarding spirit, it will be difficult for us to retreat." These words made Zhang Linyan fall into thinking. As an archer, she can actually retreat in the natural environment. Take advantage of its strong geographical location.</p>

    <p>Shanshou Ling's strength is very strong. At least it must be at the peak of the late Golden Core. It may even be in the early stage of Nascent Soul. It is very aggressive and has rough skin and thick flesh. The disadvantage is that its movements are too slow. So if you encounter it under normal circumstances. You can still run away if you want...</p>

    <p>All mountain guardian spirits are like guard dogs in the backyard. They will not keep chasing you. As long as you withdraw from the area, they will not pursue you any further.</p>

    <p>For the mountain guardian, protecting the treasures under one's nose is the key.</p>

    <p>"Then let's try what Brother Tie Yi said first."</p>

    <p>After discussing with Wang Ling using team voice skills, the three decided to adopt Tie Yi's opinion.</p>

    <p>Just a mountain guardian. Wang Ling actually didn't take it seriously at all. They were all gatekeepers. It was not as good as his Er Ha.</p>

    <p>They were led by Tie Yi to the entrance of a dense forest. Deep in the dense forest were endless mountains. There were many powerful spirit beasts inside, and it was full of danger.</p>

    <p>This trail was opened by man. Few people know about it. According to Tie Yi, this is a shortcut left by a senior. The location is not fixed. Only those who know the way of change can know how to find the shortcut.</p>

    <p>"So. Who opened this path?" Zhang Linyan was very curious.</p>

    <p>Such a method is not something that ordinary people can do. The art of geographical change is very difficult. It needs to be combined with the Five Elements and Bagua. He needs to understand the astronomical and earth veins. It has very strict requirements on the overall cultivation level of the person setting up the formation.</p>

    <p>"I heard that senior was at Wuxiang Peak before."</p>

    <p>"No... Wuxiang peak?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Starting from this dense forest, this area is also a resource within the Wuxiang Peak." Tie Yi replied.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>I dare you to follow Tie Yi and come to the Wuxiang Peak area to grab resources...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that he would be tricked by Teng Luchen in the end.</p>

    <p>This has already entered the resource area within the Wuxiang Peak. Let alone being noticed by the guardian mountain spirit. As long as there are disciples in the Wuxiang Peak, a small-scale battle is inevitable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. He felt that if this was the case, it would be better to just make this area a little more chaotic and let more people nearby join in the resource collection and robbery!</p>

    <p>He couldn't just be designed by Teng Luchen. He also had to design for Teng Luchen...</p>
