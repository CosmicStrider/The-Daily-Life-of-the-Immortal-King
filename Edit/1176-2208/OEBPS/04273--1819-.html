  <h1>Chapter 1819 Meng Liuli Seduces Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Is it an illusion?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>In other words, this is not a simple illusion, but a clone type spell that is very similar to a "real clone." But the target of the clone is not oneself, but a designated person.</p>

    <p>Meng Liuli knew that Wang Ling was difficult to deal with. Therefore, she withdrew part of Sun Rong's spiritual power. Using a super strong imitation power, she quickly combined the surging spiritual power in her body with Sun Rong's. The spiritual energy was completely assimilated and condensed into her body.</p>

    <p>As a result, she became Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This is a superb magic skill. Meng Liuli calls it {Moonlight Knight's Oath} or (Knight's Oath) for short.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the assimilation skills of soul, clone, and spiritual power are used. It is very clever. Only the Eternal One who is completely proficient in this type of magic and has extraordinary strength can do it.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that by doing this, you can really ignore the influence of the external shield and start the disintegration directly from the inside.</p>

    <p>After Meng Liuli appeared, she was full of confidence in the methods she used. She came to rescue the Skeleton Prince and the Lion-headed Man. But when she threatened Wang Ling, she looked at the two people behind her with her peripheral vision. She found that The two men were still concentrating on breaking the shield. They looked like they had completely given up resistance.</p>

    <p>She even received disdainful taunts from the skeleton prince and the lion-headed man.</p>

    <p>Ridiculing Meng Liuli for being too young...</p>

    <p>You don't understand how dangerous the boy in front of us is.</p>

    <p>The look in his eyes was clearly telling her that these skills were child's play in front of Wang Ling. He advised her to quickly give up her resistance and stop struggling pointlessly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Meng Liuli gritted her teeth and summoned a glass dagger. Staring at Wang Ling: "I am the princess of the Dream clan. Today I want to show you how powerful I am."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>She was yelling like this, but in fact, the Liuli dagger she summoned. Wang Ling could see that it was not a dagger meant to stab him. It was the dagger Meng Liuli used to stab herself.</p>

    <p>When this wonderful assimilation relationship is completed with Sun Rong, all the pain will come back to Sun Rong. Naturally, Meng Liuli is not afraid of getting hurt.</p>

    <p>The next moment, she gritted her teeth suddenly, held the handle of the dagger, and inserted it deeply into her thigh on the spot.</p>

    <p>At this time, Meng Liuli couldn't wait to see Sun Rong's extremely painful look. She was imagining the moment when her knife stabbed in. Sun Rong's snow-white and slender thigh, blood flew out at the same time.</p>

    <p>However, it turned out that she was overthinking everything.</p>

    <p>The knife had just been stabbed down. The lion-headed man on the back immediately let out a heart-rending scream. A clearly visible knife edge immediately appeared on the leg of the lion-headed man who was attempting to brake the shield. Glazed light penetrated inside. Follow the meridians and pound the Huanglong directly to destroy it inside.</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>"You ***! Self-righteous ***!"</p>

    <p>The lion-headed man roared in pain. The curse words he cursed turned into asterisks, just like sending a telegram.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Meng Liuli discovered that the face of Sun Rong, who had concluded the {Moonlight Knight's Oath} with her, actually turned into the head of a lion-headed man.</p>

    <p>Passed on?</p>

    <p>She immediately realized that this was a transfer of harm. Originally, after she concluded an assimilation contract with Sun Rong, an external force came to help Sun Rong conduct a second confrontation with the lion-headed man. Assimilation contract. This led to his stabbing. In fact, the one who was injured was the lion-headed man.</p>

    <p>But at the scene, the only person who could have done this was the young man in front of them.</p>

    <p>Meng Liuli was greatly shocked.</p>

    <p>She had devoted herself to studying the spell for so long. He actually learned it directly from her in just a few seconds. His proficiency seemed to be even higher than her own.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw through {{Moonlight Knight's Oath}, Meng Liuli realized that there was no point in continuing to use this trick.</p>

    <p>No wonder the royal family among the two Eternals looked at me with that look...</p>

    <p>There is indeed something strange about this earthly boy. He is not easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>The method of frontal coercion will no longer work. Meng Liuli felt that if she wanted to tame the young man in front of her, she must use some alternative methods.</p>

    <p>So. After unlocking the spell effect of {{Moonlight Knight's Oath}}, Meng Liuli raised her hands towards Wang Ling and slowly walked towards him. Her voice was delicate: "This little brother. I, the princess of the Dream Clan, will never obey anyone's orders. You are very strong... Do you want to work with me to revive the royal family? I am willing to be yours..."</p>

    <p>She said this to Wang Ling sincerely.</p>

    <p>Coercion failed. Meng Liuli could only try something else. And she always believed that this trick would be successful to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a hot-blooded young man. No normal man can withstand such an offensive.</p>

    <p>As she walked towards Wang Ling, she untied her belt, allowing her fair skin to be looming under the transparent glazed robe. The blood on the leg of the lion-headed man behind her had not stopped yet. It surged even more fiercely in an instant.</p>

    <p>However, the expression on Wang Ling's face remained unchanged from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>It is true that he is a young man with a strong spirit. But he will not face Meng Liuli with a strong spirit. As the princess of the Meng clan, Meng Liuli is of course a very beautiful woman. Graceful and beautiful, like a seven-color gem with dazzling brilliance.</p>

    <p>She still maintains her youthful appearance. Such an appearance is like that of a goddess walking out of a painting. Any man can only describe her with the words "pleasing to the eye."</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that Wang Ling only needs to use a little bit of eye power. Meng Liuli's appearance cannot support it.</p>

    <p>Because of the relationship between removing the false and preserving the true. Although Meng Liuli tried her best to use various beauty-preserving spells and elixirs to maintain her appearance, in the eyes of Wang Ling, as long as the King's Eyes are running, Meng Liuli is just a living person. The old woman in the time of eternity.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the eyes of the Skeleton Prince and the Lion-headed Meng Liuli, who was walking towards Wang Ling gracefully, in the eyes of Wang Ling she was just an old woman with sagging skin, age spots and wrinkles on her face. </p>

    <p>Wang Ling admits that he has never seen a beautiful girl. Faced with an old woman, he is indeed not that "hot-blooded."</p>

    <p>So. He didn't speak. He just took out his enchanted mobile phone. After applying a little King's Eyes spell, he took a picture of Meng Liuli's most realistic appearance.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling knows that what he does may be a bit cruel to women. But people... always have to face their truest side.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, he directly used King's Eyes to perform spell projection. He projected the dream glass he had just photographed into the void.</p>

    <p>This is the public execution of Meng Liuli...</p>

    <p>And this time. It's obvious.</p>

    <p>Meng Liuli couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>The corner of her mouth twitched. She looked at the projected old face in the void. Her expression immediately changed...</p>
