  <h1>Chapter 1382 Tiankeng and the 2nd Rubik's Cube</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because the identity of the King of the Divine Realm needs to be hidden, Ajuan cannot teleport directly in from the front.</p>

    <p>She took Sun Rong on a road leading to the main city.</p>

    <p>This road is very wide, but not smooth. There are mountains and mountains along the way. The hundred-meter-high Heavenly Dao ancient tree stands tall. Those branches block out the sky and the sun, giving it a sense of prehistoric times.</p>

    <p>Ajuan summoned two huge rabbits as mounts. Each of them rode on the road one at a time. The rabbits moved very fast. However, you would not feel any bumps when sitting on them.</p>

    <p>These are two old mounts carefully cultivated by Ajuan. The two rabbit ears on the top of the head will gently support the buttocks during movement, making it almost impossible to feel the impact when landing.</p>

    <p>"Hey! It's so good!" At this time, Sun Ying'er sighed.</p>

    <p>She was obviously autistic before setting off.</p>

    <p>But it looks like he has a strong ability to adjust his mood...</p>

    <p>"What's so good?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"This rabbit can actually touch Rongrong's butt! I'm so sore!" Sun Ying'er said: "Rongrong, imagine it. What if the ears underneath are not rabbit's but Ling Zhenren's..."</p>

    <p>"Shut up..."</p>

    <p>At this time, many figures appeared in front.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw many lizardman guards passing by.</p>

    <p>These are the ordinary patrol guards on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>When they saw Ajuan's rabbit, these guards consciously stepped aside.</p>

    <p>After the Heavenly Dao star went out of control, the Shenlong tribe organized a large number of guards.</p>

    <p>They are responsible for organizing the alien creatures that were accidentally swallowed up by the Heavenly Dao planet in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>Temporarily gather somewhere for resettlement.</p>

    <p>"Previously, Heavenly Dao planet annexed too many alien planets. As a result, there are all kinds of completely different alien creatures and alien civilizations on Heavenly Dao planet. Now Heavenly Dao planet has finally returned to normal. Unexpectedly, we encountered another alien planet. Something got out of control."</p>

    <p>Ajuan sighed. Then she told Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This rabbit is a special mount for the nobles on the Heavenly Dao planet. People from the Shenlong tribe have to avoid it after seeing it.</p>

    <p>"So Ajuan, you are a noble now?" Sun Rong sat comfortably on the rabbit and said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Na na! Pretending is a disguise. But I can't pretend to be too outrageous. It's not easy to pretend to be a poor man or something. Then I will run into trouble. I have to reveal my identity as the King of Kai. Isn't this more important? Is it troublesome?"</p>

    <p>Ajuan touched the rabbit fur and said, "It will be much more convenient when the divine rabbit is here. They will only appear in two places in the divine realm."</p>

    <p>"Which two places?"</p>

    <p>"Under the asses of the nobles. And in the restaurant." Ajuan said: "The spicy rabbit head is delicious!"</p>

    <p>"Meal. Restaurant..." Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She felt these rabbits were so pitiful.</p>

    <p>"They are all divine rabbits who have made mistakes or died. They actually wish they could be eaten." Ajuan said with a smile: "Being enjoyed by gods can lead to reincarnation and reincarnation in advance."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In front of the main city area. Sun Rong saw the emerald green figure from a distance.</p>

    <p>Er Ha has been waiting there for a long time. Lord Ma's transmission was too accurate and did not make Er Ha take many detours. It had arrived about a quarter of an hour before Sun Rong arrived.</p>

    <p>"You came so fast. Er Ha!" Er Ha jumped up and climbed onto the back of the divine rabbit.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hugged Er Ha and couldn't help but rub her face.</p>

    <p>"You came too slowly! So why don't you let Lord Ma send you here?" Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"Ajuan took me to see a lot of the scenery of Heavenly Dao along the way. It felt a bit like the prehistoric times written in the book." Sun Rong replied: "Of course. It's also possible that the author did it for the sake of word count."</p>

    <p>A clue revealed. This made Er Ha suddenly realize: "The main city is different. It's quite modern."</p>

    <p>"Have you been here?"</p>

    <p>"Have you never eaten pork before, or seen a pig run? Earlier, your little piggy came here with the Bai Qiao girl, and then the Bai Qiao girl fused all the scenes of the Divine Path Star into her Cultivation Simulator." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Mentioning {Cultivation Simulator}. Er Ha heard that Bai Qiao is about to start a public beta without deleting files. It will definitely be popular by then.</p>

    <p>Previously. It remembered that Wang Ling set up a character named "Qin Zhong" for itself.</p>

    <p>After the official open beta, this "Qin Zhong" will appear as an NPC as an Easter egg in the game.</p>

    <p>After following Ajuan into the main city, Sun Rong saw a place in front of the Shenlong people to pick up and stay. It looked like a Heidi driver who arrived at a certain city station and asked outsiders if they wanted to take a taxi.</p>

    <p>However, these Shenlong tribe members did not disturb Sun Rong them. The Shenlong rabbit is a symbol of nobility. The aristocrats in the main city are either rich or noble. They are very sensible and know that they cannot afford to offend them.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>An unexpected roar came from the front. Even the earth was trembling. A group of black-armored guards protecting the city passed by on ancient lizard beasts several meters long. They seemed to be handling some urgent matters.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, get out of the way!"</p>

    <p>These ancient lizard beasts were tall and ferocious. They were extremely huge, but they moved extremely fast. They quickly rushed forward with this group of black-armored guards.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It seems like something big is happening ahead." Ajuan frowned.</p>

    <p>The black armor in the heart of the city will not be dispatched easily. These are very powerful Shenlong tribesmen. Once they gather together, it means that something major will happen that cannot be solved by ordinary guards.</p>

    <p>"I can feel the resonance." At this time, Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>From the moment she entered the city center, she felt Aohai constantly vibrating.</p>

    <p>"Have you already resonated?" Ajuan was surprised.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She spread Aohai's sword energy. Following the guidance of the resonance, she let the divine rabbit below lead her there.</p>

    <p>In the process of pursuit, Sun Rong discovered that they were actually following the group of black-armored guards who hurriedly passed through the market.</p>

    <p>When they reached the place where the resonance was strongest, Black Armor stopped. The Divine Rabbit following behind also stopped.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of them shocked the three women.</p>

    <p>This is the direction in front of the shrine near the center of the city. A huge sinkhole actually appeared there!</p>

    <p>The radius is about a hundred feet long!</p>

    <p>"There is something strange about this sinkhole." Er Ha instinctively sensed the danger of this sinkhole.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid it has something to do with the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube." Sun Rong affirmed.</p>

    <p>She could feel that the sword energy emitted by her Aohai was being sucked into the sinkhole in front of her.</p>

    <p>"What's going on with this sinkhole?" Miss Ajuan asked a black armored man.</p>

    <p>The black armor was a little impatient. But when he saw the sacred rabbit sitting under Ajuan, he still answered honestly: "It fell suddenly. The number of casualties is not limited for the time being."</p>

    <p>There was cold sweat on his forehead. He obviously didn't know how to deal with the matter in front of him.</p>

    <p>Ajuan nodded: "Na na! I order you. Immediately organize manpower and seal off the surrounding area. Complete the evacuation of the surrounding area as soon as possible. Leave this to us."</p>

    <p>She immediately turned her gaze to the sinkhole in front of her.</p>

    <p>This sinkhole is very dangerous. It exudes a very terrifying atmosphere of laws. The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is in the sinkhole.</p>

    <p>Although the cause is unknown.</p>

    <p>But for now, I can only go down and find out in person.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. Are you ready?" Ajuan asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"No problem!" Sun Rong cheered up.</p>

    <p>"Jump!" Ajuan ordered.</p>

    <p>The divine rabbit they sat down jumped directly into the sinkhole without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Holy shit, Captain! They really jumped... I read that right! And that human girl seems to be only in the Foundation Building stage! Do you dare to jump like this?" I watched helplessly as Sun Rong jumped. 1 The black-armored guard was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Don't even look at it. Follow the instructions of the adult just now. Let's organize the evacuation." At this time, the captain of the black-armored guard frowned and then said.</p>

    <p>"But they are just nobles. It seems they have no right to interfere with our actions..."</p>

    <p>"Stupid! Didn't you hear the 'na na' from the curly-haired girl just now?"</p>

    <p>The black-armored captain asked: "How many old suonas are there on our planet Heavenly Dao?"</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be... Lord Boundary King!"</p>

    <p>Only then did all the black-armored guards suddenly realize.</p>

    <p>But they still couldn't figure it out. Why did the King of Kai bring a girl from the Foundation Building stage here...</p>

    <p>What's the use of the Foundation Building period? You're looking for death if you come here!</p>
