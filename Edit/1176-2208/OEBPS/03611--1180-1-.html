  <h1>Chapter 1180 No holiday even on New Year's Eve</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone's concern made Wang Ling feel uncomfortable. The strength of the support group formed by Xia Ming also exceeded Wang Ling's expectations. Wang Ling didn't expect that he would really become a crowd In my eyes, the group pet mascot is still the type that looks very weak and needs to be protected at all times...</p>

    <p>As for the question of why Wang Ling has aroused the desire to protect others in a short period of time. As the leader of the Wang Ling fan support club, Xia Ming has taken on the important responsibility of interviewing everyone.</p>

    <p>"Why do you think classmate Wang Ling needs protection?" Xia Ming randomly conducted interviews in the camp. The interview data will allow him to better perform his duties as a group leader.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu, who was the first to be questioned, showed a surprised expression: "Mascots don't need to be protected and used as vases. Should we still let mascots charge into battle?"</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu decided to join the group after Wang Ling brought Wang Zhen back... because as far as he knew, Wang Ling was the weakest person in the entire Number 60 High School. That's why he was regarded as The school mascot. However, after Wang Zhen disappeared, this weakest mascot actually went out to find Wang Zhen and brought Wang Zhen back.</p>

    <p>This made Nan Yixiu, the captain of Nanhai Tianzhong, feel ashamed.</p>

    <p>So after thinking carefully, Nan Yixiu excitedly grabbed Xia Ming's hand and made the following comment: "As a mascot, classmate Wang Ling is really very courageous!"</p>

    <p>Have courage.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming really recognized this point. He had a conflict with Wang Ling at the beginning. But in front of so many people, he made a challenge to Wang Ling for Sun Rong! The result was Wang Ling Not only did he not back down, he even took the initiative after school.</p>

    <p>He is indeed a very courageous man.</p>

    <p>Except for Nan Yixiu, everyone else gave their own answers to the question of why Xia Ming, Wang Ling, needed protection.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "As the closest classmates to Wang Ling, why do you want to join the support club?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Wang Ling Well! The main reason why I joined the support club is because you promised to copy my homework every day as long as I join the school."</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "Can you stop being so honest???"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao sighed helplessly: "There is no way. I used to copy Wang Ling's homework. He always got half of it wrong. What can I do... I got 4 wrong out of 10 questions. I always tried to pass the exam. The line passed. I don't even know how Wang Ling did it!"</p>

    <p>Regarding Chen Chao's answer, Guo Hao has a deep understanding of it. Wang Ling is amazing both in exams and homework... For example, Guo Hao. He really can't figure out why Wang Ling can be accurate every time. Pressing the line. This is simply not something ordinary people can do.</p>

    <p>"So. The purpose of joining the support club is just to better...copy homework?" Xia Ming felt ashamed of this speculative behavior.</p>

    <p>Below is what girls think about Wang Ling. This is also the part that Xia Ming is most concerned about.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong. Why do you think classmate Wang Ling can inspire people to have a strong desire for protection?" Among the girls, the first person Xia Ming asked was Sun Rong. As he and Wang Ling's common "competition goal." Xia Ming is very concerned about Sun Rong's true thoughts.</p>

    <p>Facing the interview, the expression on Sun Rong's face seemed particularly relaxed: "I just... I just think classmate Wang Ling is very cute!"</p>

    <p>"..." Xia Ming suddenly felt like he had suffered a critical hit of 10,000 points.</p>

    <p>Cute...</p>

    <p>Is this a word used to describe boys?</p>

    <p>Xia Ming suddenly felt a little "sour." This was not only an era of scientific cultivation, but also an era of rampant lemon people. Their army of lemon people would use various bottom-line methods to personally attack you and... All kinds of irony.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming wanted to ask, isn't he cute? However, facing a losing situation, Xia Ming felt that he had no chance of winning... because even from a boy's perspective, he had to admit it. Wang Ling does make some sense.</p>

    <p>However, as a boy with normal orientation, Xia Ming has no unnecessary thoughts about Wang Ling. He now only has full admiration for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is certainly cute. But everyone is so protective of classmate Wang Ling. Is it just because of his cuteness?" As the leader of the fan club, Xia Ming hopes to dig into something deeper. Compared to Because of Wang Ling's cuteness. In fact, what he admires more is Wang Ling's personality charm.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Isn't it enough just to be cute? There are too few cute boys these days. Look at the dead fish eyes of classmate Wang Ling. They are round and cute. Look at your eyes again. Eyelids. Every time I see you, I feel like you're not awake yet."</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Youyue on the side also interjected: "And have you noticed that classmate Wang Ling is particularly keen on dry noodles. According to our family's many years of experience in food, being keen on eating a snack means that this person is more dedicated. Usually the ideal type of boyfriend!"</p>

    <p>"And snacks like dry noodles can also draw cards. If a man is so interested in the lottery, it means saving. And the lottery of dry noodles is mostly for collecting cards. This also symbolizes a spirit of persistence. If you win the big prize, it also represents luck."</p>

    <p>After all, Li Youyue and Sun Rong high-fived each other and said almost in unison: "Who doesn't want to have a cute, dedicated, persistent and lucky boyfriend these days?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this point in the interview, Xia Ming felt like he had received a 10,000-ton blow...</p>

    <p>Damn it! He can't do this interview anymore!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Zhen and his party have successfully entered the stalactite cave.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's tied man tied up Qimen Qilang tightly. Because Qimen Qilang was already under control, their third brother Yimen Jiulang was not blessed by the power of the curse.</p>

    <p>"I will never betray my brother. Even if you use any torture on me, I will not say a word!" Because of Wang Zhen's photo of the man tied up, it is impossible to let Qilang Demenqilang commit suicide. way to perpetuate the possibility of a curse.</p>

    <p>Demimen Qilang is a man who is not afraid of death because he knows that his death will make his third brother stronger.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter if you don't want to say it. Our purpose is not for you." Wang Zhen smiled. He has seen this method of grafting soul power through curses many times in the God's Domain. Zaomen Rokuro's method It's completely unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p>The combined fighting power of these three brothers is just an appetizer. Wang Zhen is looking forward to a real battle.</p>

    <p>As a fighting nation born in the divine domain. If a battle cannot threaten life at all.</p>

    <p>So. What else does it mean?</p>

    <p>:.:</p>
