  <h1>Chapter 1853 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Returned to the real world about an hour ago.</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong immediately took You Yueqing to the immortal garden of Lord Diulei after notifying everyone. Everyone chose to assemble there.</p>

    <p>The two arrived late. When they got there, the nine people who were notified were already sitting neatly in the villa chatting. Xiao Yin was wearing a black suit and serving tea like a butler.</p>

    <p>Even the leather shoes are on. No more bare feet.</p>

    <p>It seems that he has been trained well by Lord Diulei during this period.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing didn't know most of the people here. Even after meeting them, she looked confused. But there was one person she couldn't possibly not know.</p>

    <p>"Are you that Zhuo Yi!?" You Yueqing was shocked. She didn't expect to see Zhuo Yi here.</p>

    <p>She just heard Sun Rong calling someone. She thought they had the same name. But she didn't expect that the person calling was actually Zhuo Yi... the one who knocked down the fifth-level demon seven years ago. The king's man!</p>

    <p>"It's me." Zhuo Yi smiled. He was as friendly as ever.</p>

    <p>He took the initiative to shake hands with You Yueqing without any airs.</p>

    <p>On the way Sun Rong and You Yueqing came, Sun Rong told Zhuo Yi about You Yueqing. Including You Yueqing guessing Wang Ling had extraordinary ability.</p>

    <p>It is still necessary to say hello in advance about this matter. It is just to let everyone know about You Yueqing in advance. It does not mean that they should deliberately be wary of anything.</p>

    <p>Childhood sweethearts. What bad intentions can there be?</p>

    <p>After a simple handshake, Zhuo Yi said: "I have also heard about Daoist Master You's reputation. In my department, many subordinates have gone to Fenglei Village to inquire."</p>

    <p>"Someone from the General Administration of Hundred Schools has been there." You Yueqing also laughed immediately: "But how did General Administration Zhuo know classmate Sun Rong?"</p>

    <p>"She is my junior high school girl. I am also from Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"So it is!"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing nodded in sudden realization.</p>

    <p>"Others, do you need me to introduce you to you?"</p>

    <p>"No need to go to the Zhuo General Administration.</p>

    <p>My classmate Sun Rong has already introduced me to them on the way here. I am not face-blind. My memory is very good. I can match the faces of all my seniors. Don't worry."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Now let's get to the point."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded with satisfaction. Immediately he turned his attention to Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng took out a book of "Quotations of the Master of Fenglei Village" without haste.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's eyes widened: "How did senior Jin Deng get it..."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said with a serious smile: "Before coming, I personally went to Fenglei Village and took out this book {Quotations of the Master of Fenglei Village} that seems to record mysterious characters."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was also stunned: "Then the owner of the village just gave it to you?"</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng nodded: "The owner has heard of the poor monk's name, the poor monk only said that he was practicing cultivation passing by this place, and that he could enlighten an item for the owner free of charge, but I didn't expect that the owner of Fenglei Villa would give me the phrasebook without saying a word. However, it takes time for the proper enlightenment to take place, so the owner of Fenglei Villa also allowed the poor monk to take the catalog back with him first..."</p>

    <p>"So what if the master of the village didn't want to give the copy of this book..."</p>

    <p>"It can't be otherwise."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "Because I am taking little friend Qin Zhong with me. Also accompanying me are little friends Xiang Yi and Zhang Zhui."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked: "So if you can't borrow it, you will let Senior Xiang Yi and Senior Zhang steal it..."</p>

    <p>"That's wrong."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui crossed his arms and snorted arrogantly: "We are all cultural people. It's not like I won't return this quote. At most, it's borrowed."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, You Yueqing: "..."</p>

    <p>Although it still feels a bit strange somewhere. But at least the seniors working together can do things smoothly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong remembered that there was a private agreement between Xiang Yi and Zhang Zhui before. It was said that they would compare who is the "strongest lock picking king" under the condition of legal compliance.</p>

    <p>Originally, the two agreed to provide free locksmith services in their respective designated areas to find residents who could not enter their homes and needed to find a locksmith. Whoever helped more people within the same period of time would receive the reward. This is the title of "The Strongest Lock Picking King."</p>

    <p>It's a pity that due to time constraints, the competition between the two has not been completed yet.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong don't know what it means to win this title. But really speaking...sometimes a man's happiness is such a simple thing.</p>

    <p>Just when Sun Rong was stunned, a familiar voice reached her ears.</p>

    <p>"The video sent by Taoist Master You before did contain vaguely mysterious text. And we also compared it with this book of quotations. The fonts of the two are almost the same."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi rubbed his eyebrows and said:</p>

    <p>"But at present we are not sure that this mysterious text was written by the owner of Fenglei Manor himself."</p>

    <p>"Why do you think so?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Because the book used to record the sayings of the owner of Fenglei Manor is an ancient relic. It is very thick. It looks like a dictionary. The overall material of the sayings is also very special. Even if 10,000 years have passed, the handwriting on it can still be clearly seen. On the paper neat as new. Not a single wrinkle."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi raised the corner of his mouth and said: "So now we suspect that this book of quotations was used twice by the owner of Fenglei Village. The first half records the mysterious texts. The second half records the words written by the owner of Fenglei Village himself."</p>

    <p>"So, seniors, can you find a way to decipher the quotations?" You Yueqing sat down and asked. She took a sip of the tea poured by Xiao Yin. She felt that the tea was rich, refreshing and pleasant, which lifted her spirits all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>This is peerless tea. Compared with the tea she drank at Sun Rong's house, it's almost the same. But with Zhuo Yi's current status, You Yueqing thinks it's okay to get such tea. It's strange.</p>

    <p>She always thought that Immortal Garden Villa was the home of Zhuo Yi. But if she knew it was Lord Diulei's home, I'm afraid You Yueqing would be even more surprised by Sun Rong's connections.</p>

    <p>"A few of us took turns to check it before. This mysterious text is indeed very miraculous. It can be deciphered by extraordinary people." Li Xian said. He and the others looked at each other. After all, he did not directly say the Eternal One in front of You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi held Wang Zhen's arm and said, "So the most likely way to succeed at the moment is to let senior Jin Deng try it."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Sun Rong also remembered. Monk Jin Deng has a swastika. And there are three groups of Buddha fire protection in the past, present and future. Even if the swastika is damaged due to deciphering the mysterious text, it can be repaired through Buddhist fire.</p>

    <p>It's just that this kind of temptation also makes Monk Jin Deng worried. After all, according to what Sun Rong said before, Wang Ling doesn't want anyone to get involved in this matter.</p>

    <p>So the monk is still struggling.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is these mysterious texts...</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng did not expect that he had lived so many lives and that he actually had writings that he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>He was worried that after using the swastika, he would sink too deeply and might directly enter into the scenario preset by the mysterious text to form a soul interaction.</p>

    <p>If this goes too deep, he may be trapped in this world constructed by mysterious texts and be unable to get out...</p>
