  <h1>Chapter 1634 Young people don't respect martial ethics</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A large number of artificial humans Liu Renfeng poured out from every corner of the restricted laboratory. As if they were prepared in advance, they appeared in various corridors. They crowded the corridors like sardines. Just like during the morning rush hour. subway.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying raised his arm and held a piece of Liu Renfeng's throat in the air. Then he gently made a gesture of squeezing his hands.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The heads of these androids rolled to the ground like watermelons...</p>

    <p>Then these dead androids were quickly replaced by new ones. They had faces exactly like Liu Renfeng, but without any emotion.</p>

    <p>After seeing their companions fall to the ground, the living androids around them will pick up the broken parts and throw them into the recycling channel of the restricted laboratory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying doesn't know how many fakes the real Liu Renfeng has made for himself. But judging from the wave after wave of situations, the number is definitely no less than tens of thousands...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "How many things did this crazy woman do to herself when she fell to the ground..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "It seems that this woman has an emergency plan. She may want to break through the door of the infinite secret realm from the front."</p>

    <p>"But I heard before that it is not easy to open the entrance to this secret realm. It requires a lot of spiritual power." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Indeed. There are not many people who have the ability to open the entrance to this secret realm alone."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying thought of something: "But if there are a large number of people, it will be different. I think it would be better to report this matter to the Office of Strategic Deception as soon as possible. We will not do anything next. Intervene. Just wait until things end smoothly."</p>

    <p>He is the shadow of Wang Ling. He is connected with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just before he said this, he also knew.</p>

    <p>That man... is finally ready to take action...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The appearance of Wang Ying was a huge surprise to Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect that when she was about to open the infinite secret realm, she would be stopped by a young man who suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she still has an emergency plan.</p>

    <p>As long as her true body is not found, then she has not lost this battle.</p>

    <p>In Shou Chong's private laboratory. Several androids Liu Renfeng have complete control of this place.</p>

    <p>"Heh... Junior Brother Wolong. Long time no see." Liu Renfeng uses the will of the main body to link to the brain tissue of one of the artificial humans to achieve short-term control.</p>

    <p>When this group of artificial humans rushed in, Shou Chong already realized that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>There was an emergency escape button in his laboratory. Just as he was about to pounce and press it, one of the androids kicked him in the abdomen, shattering his dream on the spot...</p>

    <p>"Sister, you can't make the same mistake again and again..."</p>

    <p>"Now are you willing to call me Senior Sister?"</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng couldn't help laughing: "Artificial spiritual roots are my lifelong dream. And I have obtained this core technology. Now I just need to find the materials in the secret realm."</p>

    <p>According to Liu Renfeng's plan, she originally planned to use Jiang Yingying to analyze the key to the infinite secret realm and enter through the back door.</p>

    <p>But this plan was broken just now because of Wang Ying's relationship.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng must not be enabled for contingency plans now.</p>

    <p>That is to break through the secret realm from the front through Shou Chong's method.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong's private laboratory. She has been secretly observing it for a long time. She also knows the plan that Shou Chong has currently formulated for a breakthrough from the front.</p>

    <p>However, it is not easy to open the door to the infinite secret realm head-on.</p>

    <p>This requires a one-time injection of spiritual power that far exceeds the current level of cultivators on earth...</p>

    <p>Even the senior standing behind her couldn't provide such explosive psychic output in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>"Sister, you should know that you are surrounded. You have no way to retreat."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said: "Office of Strategic Deception! And those heaven-level sect leaders have surrounded your laboratory!"</p>

    <p>"Do you think I don't know anything about the outside world?"</p>

    <p>At this moment. Liu Renfeng laughed again: "As long as my essence has not been found."</p>

    <p>"I haven't lost yet. Not to mention. You think I didn't see this coming? It was a long time ago. Huaxiu Alliance has been watching me for a long time... They've surrounded my lab in the northern suburbs. You could say it was expected. Of course. If there was a mistake. I really didn't expect so many people to come." She said it with her eyes wide open.</p>

    <p>But in fact, I was still holding a lot of anger inside.</p>

    <p>Because of what happened outside, including the fact that the Intelligence Division mistakenly captured Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>They all found out after her spiritual connection with Number 010 Liu Renfeng was severed due to Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for Wang Ying, she might still be in the dark.</p>

    <p>These losers in the Intelligence Department don't know what to do with their food.</p>

    <p>You can catch a little girl wrongly!</p>

    <p>As for the current siege of the northern suburbs, the large number of cultivator alliance troops is indeed beyond Liu Renfeng's expectations.</p>

    <p>But she didn't panic at all. Instead, her face showed the kind of excitement that made Shou Chong feel extremely uneasy: "It doesn't matter if there are more people. The more people, the better for me."</p>

    <p>In Liu Renfeng's second-hand plan, he wanted to use the Huaxiu Alliance to encircle him and use the spiritual energy of these cultivators to forcefully break through the main entrance of the infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>However, the second plan is actually risky.</p>

    <p>That is, if Huaxiu Alliance does not send enough people, even if she has a way to drain the spiritual energy of these cultivators, I am afraid that these spiritual energy alone will not be able to open the door to the infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>But now. She feels that the situation has become different.</p>

    <p>Currently surrounding his Fengchu laboratory in the northern suburbs are hundreds of thousands of cultivator alliance troops.</p>

    <p>The lowest level of ordinary cultivators who come to support is Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Not to mention those heaven-level sect leaders in the circle...</p>

    <p>"Sister, do you want to..." At this moment, Shou Chong's face changed drastically. He finally knew what Liu Renfeng wanted to do.</p>

    <p>"Heh heh heh." Liu Renfeng continued to cover her mouth through the android and laughed softly, "It's really God's helping hand. In order to rescue that Sun Rong girl. He actually sent so many people here. If the final The result of the battle is to steal the chicken but not lose the rice. I think this Huaxiu Alliance will definitely lose its honor."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, in the Office of Strategic Deception command center, on the huge screen, all the members of the Alliance Army participating in this incident turned into large dense red dots and appeared on the satellite map.</p>

    <p>From a conductor's point of view, Keorn has never commanded this rich battle in his eight lifetimes.</p>

    <p>However, such a large number of alliance troops were placed in his hands alone. This also tested his ability to withstand pressure and his command level.</p>

    <p>He looked at the flashing cursor of the Alliance Army on the map. He frowned slightly and said, "Master Dao, I think something is wrong. Our Alliance Army has formed a dumpling-like encirclement. But there is no resistance at all from Liu Renfeng. I feel like there is some conspiracy behind this."</p>

    <p>"As expected of the person chosen by the True Lord." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said with a smile. He looked leisurely and contented.</p>

    <p>"This... Daojun has already discovered it?" Keorn was speechless.</p>

    <p>"In the final analysis, Aunt Liu just wanted to enter the secret realm to steal materials. Now her body is missing. A large number of artificial people have emerged from the forbidden laboratory. There is no point in catching those artificial people."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said: "There is a saying. If you use a more cultural term, you will catch the turtle in the jar."</p>

    <p>Keorn: "What Daojun means is..."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord laughed: "Just let the Alliance army take advantage of it."</p>

    <p>Because. At this moment.</p>

    <p>There is already a handsome boy. He entered the infinite secret realm in advance.</p>

    <p>Just waiting at that entrance for Liu Renfeng's body to come in...</p>

    <p>Of course. In order not to delay my homework.</p>

    <p>This handsome guy even moved his desk over there. He was writing and waiting...</p>
