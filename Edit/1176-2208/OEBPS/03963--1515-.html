  <h1>Chapter 1515 Whoever wins Houlang Sang wins the world</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>Time goes back to about 2 hours ago.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was fighting a battle of wits and courage with Jiugong Xinghui and his group.</p>

    <p>The fun of Jiudaohe High School's welcome party has just begun.</p>

    <p>Domestic students are not allowed to drink alcohol. However, some alcoholic drinks with relatively low alcohol content appeared at the orientation party of Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>Many people had bad intentions and took turns coming to toast, trying to get Sun Rong and Wang Ming drunk.</p>

    <p>"Welcome you two to come from afar! On behalf of the Red Flame Club of Jiudaohe, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you two! I feel so deeply sentimental! I'll do it first as a courtesy!" said an officer who claimed to be the Red Flame Club of Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>And it was only at this time that Sun Rong realized that the internal framework structure of Jiudaohe was actually quite complicated.</p>

    <p>Although there are student unions in Huaxiu, they are officially recognized organizations.</p>

    <p>It is strictly prohibited for students to form cliques in private.</p>

    <p>But in Jiudaohe High School in Sun Island, this is actually allowed.</p>

    <p>It is said to be to cultivate a sense of sect competition among students.</p>

    <p>Only with competition can there be progress.</p>

    <p>And these gangs established by students themselves are actually on the same level as the student union.</p>

    <p>If the comprehensive score of the annual comprehensive survey exceeds that of the student union, then the president of the student union will change hands.</p>

    <p>So in a sense, the current student council president of Jiudaohe High School is the Akano Jisaki who has two birds by his side (Kongque male and Ma Jiao female).</p>

    <p>In fact, he is quite a capable person.</p>

    <p>In recent years, the comprehensive evaluation scores of the student union have been very high. It is higher than the combined scores of the student gangs below.</p>

    <p>Some people say that before Akano Jisaki graduated, his position as student council president was 100% secure.</p>

    <p>Although there are now seven largest gangs in Jiudaohe High School known as the "Rainbow Seven Gangs": Red Flame Club, Orange Light Club, Huang Photo Club, Green Hair Club, Qingchu Club, Lanyan Club, and Zifeng Club.</p>

    <p>Each of them has the urge to bring down the student union.</p>

    <p>But due to the huge influence of the student union.</p>

    <p>They are also afraid that their student gangs will use too much force.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, it may benefit other gangs.</p>

    <p>So just like that, the Rainbow Seven Gang formed a wonderful check and balance relationship.</p>

    <p>At present, the Jiudaohe Student Union led by Jisaki, and the "Rainbow Seven Gang" below have achieved wonderful checks and balances.</p>

    <p>It is also called by the students of Jiudaohe: the era of miracles...</p>

    <p>"Brothers and sisters, don't you think this Jiudaohe High School is very interesting?" Wang Ming picked up a goblet and smiled.</p>

    <p>This is the most advanced cocktail here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is an adult. He actually has a good drinking capacity.</p>

    <p>Every time he encounters a research bottleneck? Wang Ming actually secretly drinks Erguotou to find inspiration.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoer is teasing me again..." Sun Rong blushed.</p>

    <p>"I can call you Miss Rong. But every time I call you Miss Rong, there will be thousands of calls for my younger siblings in my heart."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "I have completely figured it out now. It seems to be beneficial to me if you and Ling Ling are together! I don't have to worry about my research funds in the future!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>It can only show that Brother Ming is still Brother Ming. He said a few words and Sun Rong was speechless.</p>

    <p>Sighing silently, the girl could only blush and quickly changed the subject: "That Jisaki is more capable than I thought."</p>

    <p>"Indeed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded: "With a mechanism like Jiudaohe's, it's really not easy to keep your heels firmly planted. Speaking of sterilization... Then has Miss Rong thought about the issue of sterilization after marrying Ling Ling?" .Of course. The point is not sterilization. It is marriage."</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>Sun Rong was still blushing. Pretending that he didn't hear anything, he said to himself: "Brother Xiaoer, have you noticed that the alcoholic drinks here are quite delicious."</p>

    <p>"Indeed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded: "Speaking of drinking... how many tables will be set up for your wedding with Ling Ling?"</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>After chatting with Wang Ming for a long time, many Jiudaohe gang students came over and offered a toast.</p>

    <p>In fact, this amount of alcoholic beverages cannot be compared to Wang Ming or Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ming wants to, he can use brain waves to emit alcohol from his body through his pores at any time.</p>

    <p>Second, as for Sun Rong, it is easier. She has Aohai's sword energy to protect her body. Once the alcohol enters the heart veins, the protective effect of the sword energy will dilute the alcohol from the blood vessels.</p>

    <p>No matter how high the alcohol content is, it will taste like the watered down beer in the KTV when it enters the body of Sun Rong. There is no smell of alcohol at all...</p>

    <p>It was approaching eleven o'clock. Sun Rong and Wang Ming were still on high alert.</p>

    <p>The two of them had an intuition that this New Year's Eve party was not that simple.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, just as the party was about to end, Ma Jiao, the vice president of the student union, suddenly took the initiative to talk to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>At this time, the entire audience suddenly became silent.</p>

    <p>Except for the light and melodious dance music.</p>

    <p>Everyone seemed to have discussed it and fell silent. Waiting for the head-to-head confrontation between Ma Jiao and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Hello Rong Jiang. I have been wanting to ask just now. I wonder why Houlang Sang didn't come?"</p>

    <p>"He's not feeling well. He's resting." Sun Rong said with alert eyes.</p>

    <p>"Oh~ that's right. That's such a shame. I heard that Houlang Sang is a famous mascot in your school. Number 60 High School has won awards several times. They are all closely related to Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>"That's the result of everyone's joint efforts."</p>

    <p>"Those who win Houlang Sang will win the world... this sentence can't be false, right?" Ma Jiao said with a smile: "Jiudaohe's national comprehensive strength ranking of college students. Houlang Sang ranks very high!"</p>

    <p>"This. What kind of list is this?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong's eyes dimmed. He suddenly felt as if he had been tricked.</p>
    
    <p>The girl in front of me has the nickname "Ma Jiao"... But it's obvious. This is a man-eating sparrow<sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Ma Jiao '麻雀' translates to sparrow.)</dfn><p>...</p>

    

    <p>Previously. Wang Ling focused on dealing with Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>He never expected that a group of strange girls would suddenly come to see him at the end of the New Year Party.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was monitoring the door. By the time she noticed something was wrong, it seemed that it was already too late.</p>

    <p>Because there are a lot of girls coming to Wang Ling. There are not only girls. There are also many... boys.</p>

    <p>She couldn't stop it on her own.</p>

    <p>The key is. She can't do it directly!</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin knows it very well. Now he is an assistant teacher at Number 60 High School. He represents the image of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>If you just rush out like that, wouldn't it be ruining your image...</p>

    <p>In the distance, Ma Jiao, who felt that her plan had succeeded, sneered: "Have you seen {Spike List}?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. This is not an ancient conspiracy drama from the Huaxiu Kingdom. My parents have been watching it," Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"Don't you think my current method is similar to this drama?"</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about the unicorn genius Mei Duansu in the TV series?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Ma Jiao nodded: "Now I have released the news. The one who wins Houlang Sang will win the world. In this way, there will be many people. Men and women will look for that Wang Houlang to cooperate."</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>"In this case, wouldn't there be a chance for a date between the president and Miss Sun?"</p>

    <p>"As expected of Ma Jiaojiang. But I still don't understand. What's going on with that ranking list of college students? Why does Houlang Sang's name appear on it?"</p>

  <p>"That." Ma Jiao chuckled: "Of course it was added by my own black gold system. Do you really think that Houlang Sang is very strong? No, right?"</p></div>
