  <h1>Chapter 1541 Sun Rong: After all, I paid by mistake</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong was caught off guard by the sudden confession.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what happened. As a result, Matsushita Singha's attitude towards her suddenly changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>But the serious expression on Matsushita Singha's face in front of her really made her feel at a loss.</p>

    <p>Although she has been working hard to play the role of "Jiugong Liangzi", she never wanted to find a girlfriend for Jiugong Liangzi!</p>

    <p>If Zhuo Yi knew about this. That Wouldn't be so good...</p>

    <p>In this case, Sun Rong feels that it would be more appropriate to refuse directly.</p>

    <p>Rather than letting Matsushita Singha like herself, she felt it would be better to let the girl in front of her continue to hate her.</p>

    <p>So after thinking carefully, Sun Rong followed Jiugong Liangzi's example and pulled away Matsushita Singha's hand on her arm. Then she turned her head and hummed: "Classmate Matsushita Singha. I can't possibly like girls!" There is no possibility between us!"</p>

    <p>In the end, the words were left unspoken. After saying this, Matsushita Singha was as happy as a lotus flower on the spot: "Ah! Thank you, classmate Jiugong Liangzi! I will work hard!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "???"</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha is really happy.</p>

    <p>This kind of happiness is not fake.</p>

    <p>Because as we all know, classmate Jiugong Liangzi is a big arrogant person.</p>

    <p>Even if I like something, I won't express it.</p>

    <p>The more you like someone, the more you will use hate to cover yourself up.</p>

    <p>Well, I was directly rejected.</p>

    <p>But doesn't it mean that classmate Jiugong Liangzi also likes me?</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Such magical logic. Wang Ling next to me was amazed when I heard it.</p>

    <p>Here Matsushita Singha is still pestering Sun Rong. He silently left the game with his hands in his pockets and returned to the waiting room.</p>

    <p>The war between girls. Wang Ling feels that it is better not to join in easily.</p>

    <p>And essentially, Matsushita Singha likes Jiugong Liangzi. What does it have to do with Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>Yeah!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that with Sun Rong's wisdom... he will be able to escape smoothly in the end!</p>

    <p>After the escape room grouping is completed.</p>

    <p>In the end, the 16 people with the shortest time advanced successfully.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong and Matsushita Singha. are all on the list.</p>

    <p>In the waiting room, Matsushita Singha was sitting next to Sun Rong. She looked at the person in front of her lovingly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong support amount.</p>

    <p>I never expected that things would develop to this point.</p>

    <p>In her desperation just now, she forgot that Jiugong Liangzi has this "tsundere" attribute. She shouldn't use the word "hum" when rejecting.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, I ended up paying by mistake...</p>

    <p>Let Matsushita Singha think that she has a crush on her.</p>

    <p>However, given the current general situation, Sun Rong feels that he should still focus on the overall situation.</p>

    <p>If you explain too much, you may expose yourself...</p>

    <p>Simply, just use the trick and let this misunderstanding continue.</p>

    <p>Before leaving Sun Island, she would try to find a chance to explain it to Matsushita Singha.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And on the other side. When Jiudaohe High School's top 16 list was released.</p>

    <p>In the Jiugong family's mansion, many people who heard the news couldn't help but get ready to take action.</p>

    <p>"This... Liangzi is back? How is that possible!" Jiugong Xiushi almost choked on his own saliva when he heard the news.</p>

    <p>"Miss Liangzi. She has indeed returned."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai replied.</p>

    <p>In fact, he felt very strange about this.</p>

    <p>He ordered his three most profitable subordinates, Yitong, Ertong and Santong, to investigate the matter.</p>

    <p>As expected, we found a piece of information about Jiugong Liangzi's application for returning to Huaxiu. It was confirmed that Jiugong Liangzi came back by private immortal boat.</p>

    <p>And this information has been verified by One-Eyed Samurai. There is absolutely no fake...</p>

    <p>This is not the first time Wang Ming has dealt with this matter of modifying information.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ming, this information is just a bunch of data.</p>

    <p>In addition, the fact that the Mahjong trio on Sun Island has been recruited by Wang Ling made all the clues connect. In a short period of time, no mistakes could be found.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Jiugong Xiushi and One-Eyed Samurai wouldn't think of it.</p>

    <p>The people from Number 60 High School have only been in Sun Island for a few days. They have already subdued some of their most trusted subordinates.</p>

    <p>"How could Liangzi come back at this time... just to compete?" Jiugong Xiushi frowned in the wheelchair.</p>

    <p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was something mysterious about this matter: "I'm not pretending to come to the competition. In fact, I came here specifically to report to my father about the Ghost Book riot..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Liangzi, she doesn't seem like such a snitch. Besides, she actually has no direct evidence about the riots in the replica version of {Ghost Book}."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said: "Without absolute certainty, Miss Liangzi will never alarm the master."</p>

    <p>"But what does she mean by choosing this time to come back?" Jiugong Xiushi narrowed his eyes: "Is it possible that she is pretending?"</p>

    <p>Duyan frowned.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was not that he had never doubted the possibility of disguise.</p>

    <p>But now all the evidence shows that the person now in Jiudaohe High School is Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, the student status information is back.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the surrounding students didn't seem to notice anything unusual.</p>

    <p>In Jiudaohe, One-Eye actually has an informer.</p>

    <p>"One of Jiudaohe's students has an informant arranged by me. She undoubtedly believes that this person is Jiugong Liangzi." One-Eyed Samurai said.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi nodded: "You have a plan among Jiudaohe's students. I know this. But you never told me who it is."</p>

    <p>"Do you remember the Matsushita family?"</p>

    <p>"You mean the family that sells electronic spirit beasts?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>Matsushita's electronic Kaiju has a worldwide reputation.</p>

    <p>There is no need to feed. You only need to provide a spirit stone to achieve long-term battery life. There are electronic spirit beasts for home use and some for combat.</p>

    <p>However, due to mechanical limitations, the current average combat power of combat-type electronic spirit beasts is not too high. The strongest combat model is only Golden Core.</p>

    <p>There is actually a lot of room for development in the future.</p>

    <p>If the material problem can be solved, Panasonic's electronic beasts will most likely enter the cultivation arms industry.</p>

    <p>As for why Jiugong Xiushi is so familiar with Panasonic.</p>

    <p>In fact, the reason is very simple.</p>

    <p>Because the Jiugong family has actually always regarded the Panasonic family as a competitor...</p>

    <p>The hegemony of Sun Island. Although it is currently in charge of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>But whether we can sit down for a long time in the future actually depends on the efforts of the juniors.</p>

    <p>"A member of the Panasonic family is actually your spy?"</p>

    <p>"That second young lady, Matsushita Singha, is my apprentice."</p>

    <p>"When did you accept such a disciple..." Jiugong Xiushi was shocked.</p>

    <p>"The apprentice in the game." Duyan said: "I know him from Jian Wang 33."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi looked incredulous: "I remember that this Matsushita Singha seems to be in the top 16 this time."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Duyan nodded and said, "My apprentice has always regarded Jiugong Liangzi as his target. He has done some research on Jiugong Liangzi. He will never make a mistake."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>A person who was supposed to be in the country of Huaxiu suddenly appeared quietly on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>And everything is perfect. There is no mistake at all.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi felt that all this was a living hell...</p>

    <p>In fact, in Jiugong's house, there are people who think it's a ghost.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi is not alone...</p>
