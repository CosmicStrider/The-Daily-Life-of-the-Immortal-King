  <h1>Chapter 1472 Sun Rong's Love Rival Radar</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The goal was achieved. Wang Ling is in a good mood.</p>

    <p>Everyone left the cold weapon store with satisfaction. Before leaving, Sun Rong handed a note to the manager of the store.</p>

    <p>After reading this, the store manager quickly wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p>

    <p>He quickly summoned an employee and passed this note over: "Quickly, notify me. As the lady said, prepare immediately..."</p>

    <p>"Have you noticed it, Miss?"</p>

    <p>"It's expected. Miss is a very smart person. If you are caught with even the slightest loophole, there will be problems."</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling stared at the jade bottle in his hand and fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Marrow Cleansing Pill...</p>

    <p>This thing is actually just a jelly bean to him. It has no other use.</p>

    <p>The normal marrow-cleansing pill is a pill that purifies spiritual roots. It keeps the meridians in a cultivator's body clean, thus assisting in accelerating practice. It has a miraculous effect on the practice of low-level people.</p>

    <p>Because the lower the level of a cultivator, the worse the environment in the body will be, and the more impurities will be discharged.</p>

    <p>This is why many practitioners in the Foundation Building stage will have black and sticky substances appear on their bodies after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill.</p>

    <p>These are toxins that have been in the body for a long time.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>With his constitution, nothing can be washed out.</p>

    <p>This marrow-cleansing pill will actually be more helpful to other people.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling decided in his heart to find an opportunity to split the marrow-cleansing pill into two pills and give them to them.</p>

    <p>After getting along for more than half a semester, Chen Chao and Guo Hao have become Wang Ling's best friends.</p>

    <p>Send some gifts. Of course.</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao and Guo Hao's faces were full of envy.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that they don't know {Light Body Technique}. So they can't throw the Stone Spear farther away.</p>

    <p>On the way to the flagship store of Gansu Noodles in Gujie, both of them were feeling emotional.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is indeed the mascot of the class...it is simply the only koi carp in the world of cultivation!</p>

    <p>But having said that, they did feel that the atmosphere on the ancient street today seemed a bit strange... but they just couldn't pinpoint what was strange.</p>

    <p>No matter where they go, the store staff will stare at them with smiling expressions and good attitude.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao even wondered if someone would provide toilet paper service if he went to the toilet by himself.</p>

    <p>"You said...are the people on this ancient street related to the Huaguo Shuilian Group?" Chen Chao discussed with Guo Hao in a low voice on the way.</p>

    <p>"That's not true..." Guo Hao shook his head after hearing this.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Sun Rong came out this time. Indeed, I didn't say hello in advance. There has long been no battle like in the past.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao, and Li Youyue are like a mirror in their hearts.</p>

    <p>This is obviously a girl learning low-key behavior from someone.</p>

    <p>But how much will it cost to replace the entire street with people from the Huaguo Shuilian Group?</p>

    <p>This was a "low-key trip" for them. Guo Hao felt that Sun Rong had no reason to do that.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling and others walked out of the Stone Spear store. Jiang Yingying walked in with Wei Zhi on the back.</p>

    <p>The store manager glanced at Jiang Yingying warily. Then he walked over with a smile: "Welcome, you two."</p>

    <p>Seeing Jiang Yingying hesitating, Wei Zhi sighed and said first, "That's right. We also want to participate in this Stone Spear throwing event."</p>

    <p>"Also! Can I ask...what rewards did those people get?" When this question was asked, Jiang Yingying felt her face flush. She felt like she was a slut following behind.</p>

    <p>"This is confidential." The store manager smiled and said, "We are not in a position to disclose customer privacy. In addition, if you participate in the Stone Spear throwing activity, it will cost 1,000 yuan per time."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Isn't it possible to try it for free in the first round...and why is it 1,000! Isn't it 100!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying and Wei Zhi were both surprised.</p>

    <p>Because when the two of them were eavesdropping outside the door, that's not what the store staff said at all!</p>

    <p>"Because the previous prizes have been taken away, the prizes prepared later are of higher value, which is equivalent to increasing the prize pool. Of course, the price will also increase. And the daily free qualifications for the Stone Spear throwing event. We are limited to the first one A batch of customers participated." The store manager smiled.</p>

    <p>Such "targeted measures" were actually arranged on the small note that Sun Rong just handed him.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Sun Rong is too alert.</p>

    <p>Since integrating Aohai's combat power, Sun Rong's perception ability has long been different from ordinary people. Therefore, no matter how Jiang Yingying disguises herself, her aura has been recognized by Aohai before.</p>

    <p>Therefore. There is no way to escape the sight of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er calls this ability: love rival radar...</p>

    <p>What stands out is the principle of precision and nipping problems in the bud.</p>

    <p>To put it simply, it can be roughly summed up in one sentence: That is, you can chase boldly, but you will be clearly arranged by me on the way to chase...</p>

    <p>However, although it is "intentionally targeted", it cannot be made too obvious.</p>

    <p>The store manager finally gave Jiang Yingying a preferential treatment: "Because the lady is so beautiful, you can buy one and get one free for the first order. The more times you buy the first order, we can consider doubling it directly."</p>

    <p>"That group of people just now. If you can't tell me what the prizes are, you can tell me how many prizes they won, right?" Jiang Yingying thought of Sun Rong walking out with a smile on his face. He couldn't help but feel something in his heart. A kind of fire.</p>

    <p>She doesn't want to lose to this evil capitalist girl!</p>

    <p>To be honest, the store manager was stunned for a moment after hearing this question.</p>

    <p>Because the person who just threw the first prize was not Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But obviously. The lady in front of me seems to have misunderstood...</p>

    <p>But... it doesn't matter anymore.</p>

    <p>His mission is to lock this "fake couple" firmly in his store.</p>

    <p>So. The store manager smiled and said: "It's the first prize! It needs to be thrown 5000 meters to reach the standard! Since the first prize just now was taken away, the new first prize is the best Foundation Building Dan."</p>

    <p>The best Foundation Building pill???</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Jiang Yingying were stunned when they heard this.</p>

    <p>This thing is really worth a lot of money!</p>

    <p>The market value of a high-end Foundation Building pill on the market is 5 million per pill, which is nearly the price of a house.</p>

    <p>The best Foundation Building elixir. It needs to be doubled at least. It's worth tens of millions of dollars...</p>

    <p>This cold weapon shop is really not normal!</p>

    <p>How could such a big reward be used as a bet...</p>

    <p>So Wei Zhi immediately thought of two possibilities.</p>

    <p>The first situation is that the prize may be fake.</p>

    <p>The second situation is the merchant's routine. Provide a sufficiently attractive reward and then ask people to complete impossible tasks.</p>

    <p>5000m Stone Spear Throw. Can it really be done...</p>

    <p>"Yingying. How about we forget it." Wei Zhi said calmly.</p>

    <p>However, Jiang Yingying could still hear Wei Zhi's words: "I don't want it! 5000 meters! She can do it. Why can't I..."</p>

    <p>Then the girl stared at the store manager with a serious expression: "5000 meters, right? I'll buy 30 times first!"</p>

    <p>30 times. That's thirty thousand yuan...</p>

    <p>For a girl with a small amount of savings, it is definitely a huge amount of money.</p>

    <p>But Jiang Yingying feels that he can get his money back!</p>

    <p>Doubled in the first round. Then she has sixty chances.</p>

    <p>It's only 5000 meters. Sun Rong can do it. So can she!</p>

    <p>As long as she gets this top-quality Foundation Building Pill, she will be able to turn over!</p>

    <p>"Okay, Miss. Thank you for your patronage." The store manager smiled.</p>

    <p>After completing the payment process, he took the initiative to take out a Stone Spear and handed it to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>The moment Stone Spear was put into his hands, the heavy weight was instantly transferred to his hand. Jiang Yingying felt that she almost knelt down on the spot...</p>

    <p>Why is this Stone Spear. so heavy!</p>
