  <h1>Chapter 1872 Today's chapter name has finally been changed</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Book of Nine Realms was obtained. The biggest task of Emperor Dongda's trip was completed. He was ready to leave before the auction was completely over.</p>

    <p>As for the deposits paid previously, Dongda has already left the address. The Central Auction House will send someone to deliver it to the designated location.</p>

    <p>As the largest auction house in the Central Trade System, the credibility of the Central Auction House will not arouse anyone's doubts.</p>

    <p>"This friend from Room 1 stays." As soon as he arrived at the door of the auction house, someone quickly caught up with him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling recognized the origin of this person.</p>

    <p>This is the young man next to Madam Shanxiu, the headmaster of the Immortal Mountain Sect. He is participating in this auction with Madam Shanxiu. He has red lips and white teeth, and has a pretty face and pretty eyes. He is quite temperamental.</p>

    <p>Judging from his overall strength, he should be a true disciple of the Immortal Mountain Sect.</p>

    <p>"I am Mei Yunhai. I am the true disciple of Madam Shanxiu." The young man said, "My madam would like to invite you all to come to the temple for a talk. I wonder if I can give you a favor?"</p>

    <p>"I have to ask clearly. Do you want to invite all of us? Or do you just want to invite my master?" Zhang Zhui said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"This... of course everyone. Of course. The main reason is that I want to talk to this gentleman." Mei Haiyun was speechless for a moment. But he responded quickly. He immediately bowed and said, and turned his eyes in the direction of Wang Ling .</p>

    <p>"What does Mrs. Shanxiu want from our master?"</p>

    <p>"You will know when you go. This matter is related to the Book of Nine Realms. This is a little reminder from my master to your master." Mei Yunhai kept it secret and did not explain it directly.</p>

    <p>If he were an ordinary person, Emperor Dongda would have left without turning around. But this time the person who stopped him was the famous leader of the Immortal Mountain Sect. Maybe he would actually hear something interesting.</p>

    <p>There was still some time before the gathering of the four emperors. So Emperor Dongda thought it would be okay to go there to relieve his boredom.</p>

    <p>Of course, the actions here have already been written and arranged in the diary.</p>

    <p>After agreeing to Mei Yunhai's request, Emperor Dongda immediately moved towards the temple.</p>

    <p>During the Eternal Period, almost all the major cities in the Four Regions and the Central Region had temples.</p>

    <p>That is a place used to offer incense. If you are pious, you may receive certain immortal blessings.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling, Sun Rong all feel extremely unfamiliar to this kind of eternal culture that is familiar to the eternal people.</p>

    <p>"The temple... is it similar to a Buddhist temple?" Sun Rong asked. She felt that she had asked a stupid question.</p>

    <p>However, Dongda's answer was very gentle: "Similar. But not exactly."</p>

    <p>Within the team voice skills, Emperor Dongda patiently replied: "Even cultivators need faith. The temple is a place where cultivators can continue their faith and where like-minded cultivators can gather their faith."</p>

    <p>"Then I dare to ask, senior. Who is enshrined in the temple? Dao Ancestor Wang?"Sun Rong was curious.</p>

    <p>"Dao Ancestor Wang is too illusory for most cultivators. It is an existence that is elusive. The older generation of cultivators have feelings for Dao Ancestor Wang. But in the eternal time, these new generation of cultivators have feelings for Dao Ancestor Wang. The people the researchers have the most contact with are us, that is, the Four Emperors."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Emperor Dongda couldn't help scratching the back of his head: "Hahaha. I'm a little embarrassed to say it. In fact, the four of us are the ones enshrined in this temple..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Wang Zhen was stunned at the same time. Three faces were confused.</p>

    <p>Taoism worships the Three Pure Ones. Buddhism worships Buddha. Throughout the ages, they actually worshiped the Four Emperors...</p>

    <p>So going to the temple now means that Emperor Dongda will worship himself.</p>

    <p>This is too shameful!</p>

    <p>"That means the four of you are worshiped at the same time in the temple? If you have different beliefs, will there be a direct fight?" Wang Zhen couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"You don't know something about this."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui spoke up and explained on his behalf, with an old-fashioned look: "Only the Central Galaxy is special. There are statues of the four emperors in the temple. Otherwise, everyone usually worships each other.</p>

    <p>"Worship the emperor in whichever region you live in. Of course, there are also more moderate and stable groups who offer sacrifices to all four at home. No one can be offended."</p>

    <p>"As for the temple in the Central Region, it is because there are ancient city guards jointly sent by the four regions. Even if they have different beliefs, they will not fight because of their different beliefs."</p>

    <p>"What about the faces of the Four Emperors statues?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it's DIY..." Zhang Zhui replied using a more modern word: "Normal cultivators cannot reach the level of seeing clearly the faces of the four emperors when their combat power is at full strength. Therefore, the true appearance of the four emperors is unknown among the people. There have been many versions circulated. And the one used for carving statues of gods is naturally beautiful and just right. The kind of facial features that are not angry and self-defeating."</p>

    <p>So it is.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong all nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>Things in the eternal world and some unique folk cultures are not common in modern cultivation society. They are knowledge that cannot be learned in textbooks.</p>

    <p>This aroused a strong interest in both of them.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Zhen, he knows more about eternal things than Wang Ling and Sun Rong. But those are just some things passed down by the elders. Many things are hearsay. Now through this opportunity going to the Eternal World can be regarded as a make-up study.</p>

    <p>The nearest temple to the Central Auction House is five hundred miles away. Zhang Zhui hired a Pegasus carriage and took everyone there.</p>

    <p>Everyone was riding in the carriage and speeding through the sky. As they approached the temple, Emperor Dongda's body began to radiate divine radiance. Colorful and seven-color runes bloomed from his body like lotus flowers. It was dazzling.</p>

    <p>There was no sound at all. But it exuded a terrifying spiritual fluctuation.</p>

    <p>"Oops... forgot about this..."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda pondered. Something was wrong. He squeezed the magic weapon with his hand and quickly forced the spiritual energy that was involuntarily emitted from his body back into his body.</p>

    <p>"Why is this happening?"Sun Rong was completely stunned.</p>

    <p>Just now, Dongda's body was like a rainbow bridge. His whole body seemed to be releasing fireworks. It was really beautiful.</p>

    <p>"Because of the worship in the temple, someone is communicating with me. That's how it is. This is a kind of spiritual reaction. It can be regarded as a response to their wishes."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda sighed: "For example, right now, when I am communicating with you, I hear many wishes in my mind. They are all made by my believers."</p>

    <p>"Do you have any excessive wishes?" Wang Ying asked with a sly smile.</p>

    <p>"Eh... the immortal promotion meeting is coming soon. Some people want to get a good rank in the exam."</p>

    <p>"Immortal meeting?"</p>

    <p>"This is a conference jointly held by the royal families of the four regions. The purpose is to select some casual cultivators scattered among the people. Without family background, they can become members of the royal family through this immortal promotion conference." Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>"Can it still be like this?" Wang Ying was stunned.</p>

    <p>"The result of your own struggle. Of course! If the male monk has good grades, he can choose to marry his wife. If he has financial resources, he can also marry through a matchmaker. If the female monk has good grades, she can choose a member of the royal family to marry and directly become the eldest lady."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "Once they are married, the child they give birth to will be a member of the royal family. Do you think in modern times, are the eternal beings with royal status stronger? The blessing power of blood inheritance is still very realistic. But I remember that in previous immortal meetings, the royal families that were most favored by top casual cultivators seemed to be the Qinghua Sect in the Eastern Region and the Beida Sect in the Northern Region?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The top casual cultivator in the Immortal Conference has the right to independently choose all the royal families participating in the Immortal Conference. And the people who choose these two royal families are the most." Emperor Dongda nodded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "That doesn't sound like an excessive wish."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "But they are only three years old!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Then senior, why don't you find someone to help you filter your wishes?"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "All the major temples have a mechanism like wish cards. But can the wish written in the wish card be called a wish? The card says no desires and no demands. What I think in my heart is that I want them all. And I hire people. It's very expensive. I have sent people to guard every temple in this eternal world. Where did you get so much money?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "But senior, don't you have many believers? Don't they give money to those who they are wishing to?"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda laughed: "You don't really think that the money in the petition box in the temple can get into my hands..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
