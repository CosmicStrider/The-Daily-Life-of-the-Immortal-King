  <h1>Chapter 1840 You Yueqing's fortune-telling ability</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a small turtle shell that has been enlightened by Wang Ling version 1.0. It was when You Yueqing was closest to the Old Wang family. Father Wang and Mother Wang forced him to give You Yueqing a birthday gift gift.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Wang Ling was very scared because You Yueqing liked to pester him, so the purpose of Wang Ling giving the tortoise shell was very simple. He just wanted You Yueqing to use the tortoise shell to calculate where her marriage fate lies... so that she can find a good home and get married in the future.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling admits that even though he was very young at the time, he did think a lot.</p>

    <p>And You Yueqing obviously didn't use this turtle shell to calculate her marriage. Instead, she used this little turtle shell to directly embark on the path of a female Taoist priest...</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Wang Ling feels sad.</p>

    <p>It is not an exaggeration to call this relationship an ill-fated one.</p>

    <p>But then again, the monsters in the Wang family's villa, such as Lord Ma, have already gone through the latest version 3.0 of the attunement technique. Wang Ling didn't expect that the turtle shell of the version 1.0 attunement technique could actually do accurate calculation.</p>

    <p>According to You Yueqing herself, the tortoise shell can predict events in the next six months. If the timeline is closer, it will be more detailed. The further the timeline is, the blurr it will be. The most accurate one so far is to predict the bad luck of an event.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was to show off her fortune-telling ability. You Yueqing started to shake the turtle shell in front of Sun Rong seriously.</p>

    <p>After all the copper plates placed in the turtle shell were shaken out, You Yueqing stared at several copper plates carefully and began to talk.</p>

    <p>"Today, if my brothers and sisters leave a message in this chapter, they will get good luck."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Tomorrow, that shameless author Ku Xuan will update again. He will update every day. This is really unprecedented!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Four months from now, around 520, a Sun Island female star named Aragaki will announce her marriage. The Internet will lose a wife."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing said it very seriously. A divination directly revealed three things about today, tomorrow and the future. It made Sun Rong astonished.</p>

    <p>No wonder when she and Wang Ling came here, they could see all kinds of lay men and women going to Fenglei Village to worship the Three Pure Ones.</p>

    <p>Most people came to visit you specifically after hearing that You Yueqing's divination was accurate.</p>

    <p>However, You Yueqing usually fortune-tells for herself before giving fortune-telling to others. Only if it shows auspicious signs, and then based on the content of the inquiry, will she agree to the prediction. Not everyone will accept the entrustment.</p>

    <p>And now there are many gray-robed Taoist priests who look very old in Fenglei Village. In fact, these gray-robed Taoist priests are all pure cultivators who came here from all over the country. They mainly do the fortune-telling for You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>However, the Taoist temple is very small, and there are only six places for meditation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, those who come to fulfill their wishes need to make an appointment in advance.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a look at the appointment list. The longest number of people who came to fulfill their wishes had already made an appointment for seven months...</p>

    <p>"It's really popular."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was muttering in her heart.</p>

    <p>The more You Yueqing talked, the more she felt a sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>Because she never knew that Wang Ling had also taken the initiative to give things to other girls before giving them to herself.</p>

    <p>And the tiny tortoise shell can calculate such accurate predictions. Sun Rong also knows that this was specially enlightened.</p>

    <p>In other words. Maybe, maybe, probably... Wang Ling did have a crush on You Yueqing in the past...</p>

    <p>For a moment, she was in a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>She clearly knows that now is not the time to think about these problems. But once the emotions get entangled, she can't care about anything.</p>

    <p>The first round. Sun Rong had to admit that she was defeated.</p>

    <p>She couldn't see through You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>This feeling is really the first time...</p>

    <p>You Yueqing, on the other hand, took it all in stride. She was just joking and saying those words that were easily misunderstood.</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>She dug out the Taoist temple's customer directory. She presented the records of the visiting faithful men and women directly to Wang Ling and Sun Rong. She directly flipped through the list to a record from more than half a month ago: "You want to know the female lay practitioner you are looking for is this one. Her name written on it is Li Xuan. Her address is on the back."</p>

    <p>"Our Taoist temple will deliver small pendants to the visiting laymen every month. Haha. In fact, this is a way for the village owner to win over the laymen. At the same time, the pendants delivered by express delivery also have the brand name of our Fenglei Village. It is also a disguised form of advertising."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong tried hard to adjust her thoughts. Asked: "Is her name Li Xuan? Is it a pseudonym?"</p>

    <p>"I don't think so. Because I will explain before every divination that you must use your real name to divination. Otherwise, the divination will be inaccurate."</p>

    <p>"So that's what it is..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Thank you, Director You."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. Then stood up.</p>

    <p>As a result, You Yueqing grabbed Sun Rong's arm at this time: "Eh? Wait. Are you leaving now?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I've seen the address. We're going to go look for that address." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'll go with you." You Yueqing smiled.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked stunned: "But... If Taoist priest You is not here in the Taoist temple. Is there no problem?"</p>

    <p>"What's the big deal? Just don't do divination while I'm away. Besides, the village owner is here! If they need anything, they can go to the village owner!"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing narrowed her eyes and smiled cutely: "Wang Ling... Oh no. It's layman Wang. He finally took the initiative to come to me. I will definitely help with this little situation."</p>

    <p>To be honest. Sun Rong actually doesn't really want to take You Yueqing there with her.</p>

    <p>But after all, the information about the video blogger was provided by You Yueqing. If she refuses too obviously, it will make her look very arrogant.</p>

    <p>Helpless. Sun Rong could only sigh silently in her heart and agreed to You Yueqing's application for team formation.</p>

    <p>Before leaving the Taoist temple, a young Taoist priest from the Taoist temple brought a brand new pink duster to You Yueqing. It was dark pink dust. Apart from the difference in color, there seemed to be nothing special about it.</p>

    <p>Seeing You Yueqing bringing the duster. Sun Rong couldn't help but asked curiously: "What's the significance of this?"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. It's just that I think this trip may be dangerous. It's hard to go down the mountain. Of course, you have to be fully prepared."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing smiled and said: "There is a saying. The pinker the weapon, the harder it is to hit someone!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Although she is not very old, she is already at the peak of the late Foundation Building stage. She will soon step into the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>In terms of qualifications and talents in cultivation, Sun Rong feels that You Yueqing is very similar to herself. She may be even more talented than herself.</p>

    <p>After it was confirmed that You Yueqing joined the team and acted together.</p>

    <p>At the foot of the mountain, Lotus Sun used her cell phone to call a taxi.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing was stunned when she saw this: "Huh? We call a taxi here? Do you know how expensive it is to take a taxi there?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled awkwardly: "Then let's... go with the sword?"</p>

    <p>"Riding a sword is too unchallenging. Since we have to take into account cultivation, of course the first choice is to ride a bicycle. Our Taoist temple has a bicycle garage at the foot of the mountain. The three of us can just ride there." You Yueqing showed a kind smile.</p>

    <p>Again, she had no choice but to agree.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was sandwiched between the two women. He really didn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>However, the moment the three of them saw the bicycle, Wang Ling and Sun Rong regretted it. They regretted not rejecting You Yueqing's request earlier.</p>

    <p>Because this is a three-person long bicycle!</p>
