  <h1>Chapter 1673 The most exciting thing in life</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was as if he had been sleeping for an extremely long time. When Shou Chong regained consciousness, he felt that he was in an out-of-body state.</p>

    <p>A somewhat familiar human brain was soaked in a green liquid. It was connected to an unknown body along the tubes.</p>

    <p>After a burst of intense mental pain, he felt that his whole body was wandering, as if he had been hooked by something. When he came back to his senses, his whole body was already imprisoned on an electrocution chair in a dark space.</p>

    <p>"This is...the Intellectual Realm?"</p>

    <p>Shou Chong, who was once selected as a smart boy, knew exactly where this place was at a glance.</p>

    <p>Wisdom Realm. A special spiritual realm possessed by great wisdom. A place forged from the Niwan Palace where spiritual power is gathered in daily life. Slightly stronger people can refine the Niwan Palace into other derivatives such as the Memory Palace. space.</p>

    <p>And the highest realm is the realm of wisdom.</p>

    <p>An existence that encompasses all the advanced spaces of Niwan Palace!</p>

    <p>People with intelligence can theoretically use the brain waves emitted by their own brains to do anything through the power of spiritual conduction.</p>

    <p>It's just that Shou Chong never thought that his brain would one day be used to merge and become a subsidiary of others...</p>

    <p>Now. He is imprisoned in the world of intelligence.</p>

    <p>If this situation is explained in a similar academic language in the world of cultivation, it is actually a different kind of seizing one's body.</p>

    <p>"Seize the body?"</p>

    <p>At this time, in the dim and boundless world of wisdom, a disembodied voice came from the owner of this body. The words fell clearly into Shou Chong's ears: "Shou Chong. You'd better not make a mistake. I'm just taking it for Master. Just return what belongs to you.",</p>

    <p>"Your master?" Shou Chong frowned.</p>

    <p>Previously when his soul was in a dissociated state, he had witnessed the appearance of the owner of this body.</p>

    <p>In his limited memory, it seemed that he had never spent any time with this person.</p>

    <p>But for Nawei, everything seems to be less important. In his eyes, Shou Chong is just a tool used to revive the divine brain. Although the divine brain has not been completely built yet, it is probably only 70% activated. extent.</p>

    <p>But Nawei still feels as if he can become an omnipotent existence with his current mental strength.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the brain of Master Wu Xin, the most intelligent person in the universe, would be inherited by him, the only true disciple, in this way.</p>

    <p>Nawei sneered.</p>

    <p>He was holding a metal cane and wearing a bloody cloak. He walked out of the palace step by step.</p>

    <p>I don't intend to explain to Shou Chong at all.</p>

    <p>Because once the divine brain is activated to 100% level, this means that Shou Chong's brain will be completely integrated with him. And at that time, Shou Chong's personality will be completely eliminated, thereby retaining his own one. It's just a matter of a blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>Completely eliminate foreign enemies. This is Nawei's current top priority.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Outside the castle, when ten huge cubes were transmitted to different directions in the core area at the same time, the powerful oppression brought by these indescribable creatures immediately radiated to the entire vast imperial city below.</p>

    <p>In the astrology club, Xiang Yi was lying on the ground. He used the scope to clearly see the serial numbers of these containment devices: "It is the number 001-010 to contain the creatures..."</p>

    <p>Regarding the containment area under the castle, although Xiang Yi went there alone to test it several times, he did not have time to fully investigate it.</p>

    <p>Because there are too many creatures to be accommodated. There are nearly 10,000 of them.</p>

    <p>As for the contained creatures in the 010-010 range, most of them are contained in the depths.</p>

    <p>There is no way to know the specific intelligence information. The only trouble is that it is not clear what weird abilities these sheltered creatures have.</p>

    <p>But if 096 is used as the standard, the average strength of these sheltered creatures is at the peak of Dao God. The strongest is the Dao Ancestor class who has just entered the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do."</p>

    <p>At this time, Xiang Yi sighed slightly. He had already focused his sight on the scope.</p>

    <p>They tacitly understood each other and Wang Ming beside them, and said in unison: "I have no choice but to kill them all."</p>

    <p>After finishing speaking, Wang Ming and Xiang Yi looked at each other and smiled.</p>

    <p>Heroes all see the same thing. That's probably the case.</p>

    <p>"This is the first time Mr. Ming and I have met. How did Mr. Ming know that I have the ability to kill them all?" Xiang Yi smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"It's the first time I've seen it. But I'm very confident in Brother XIANG's strength." Wang Ming laughed too: "Besides. My brother was there. Lord Nawei in the castle probably didn't expect it. He was holding a single pair. Walking around in front of Wang Bomb."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>What Wang Ming said was so reasonable that Xiang Yi couldn't refute it for a while.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he felt that Wang Ming was right at all...</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling is here. Even if the sky falls, there will be someone to hold it up.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, he looked at his "3.2 billion light-year aiming magnifier" and became extremely excited. His fair face suddenly turned red.</p>

    <p>"Are you that happy?" Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Xiang Yi said excitedly: "I know that Ling Zhenren has the secret, so there is no need to worry. If I can steal one or two heads from Ling Zhenren again, I can brag about it for the rest of my life!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Except for those who are familiar with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>No one knows how exciting it is to be able to steal people's heads under the hands of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, Xiang Yi is not the only one who has this idea...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just when the ten containment device cubes appeared in public, before they were unsealed, Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi finally explained their relationship with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because the amount of information is too huge, Jiugong Liangzi is still digesting it: "This...this...you mean. Classmate Wang Ling is not your apprentice at all. But...you Master?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Zhuo Yi nodded and said: "Liangzi. I've always been sorry...I didn't mean to lie to you. I actually wanted to say it at the beginning...but this matter still has to go through my master. Just allow it."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiugong Liangzi understood instantly.</p>

    <p>The "truth" she has been seeking for so many years has also come to an end at this moment.</p>

    <p>Because according to the timeline, the ten-year-old boy that the Day-traveling ghost witnessed back then should be Wang Ling, that's right...</p>

    <p>All the unclear points were connected at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. Don't blame senior Zhuo Yi. I asked him to hide it at the beginning. After all, the less people know about classmate Wang Ling, the better."Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>In fact, she had already made a plan.</p>

    <p>If Jiugong Liangzi really couldn't accept the problem that Zhuo Yi concealed. She would never stop doing it...using Aohai's sword energy to manually erase Jiugong Liangzi's memory...</p>

    <p>Although this kind of behavior smells a bit like plastic sisters, at least it will not damage the relationship between the two.</p>

    <p>As a result, Jiugong Liangzi's reaction was much better than she expected.</p>

    <p>Although it seems that it took a long time to digest this matter, at least it was accepted.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhou Ziyi and Qin Zhong beside them actually lowered their heads after hearing this. They both looked thoughtful...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knows. After this, another explanation is inevitable.</p>

    <p>But now it is more important to solve Jiugong Liangzi's side.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she was not angry when she saw Jiugong Liangzi. Instead, like Zhai Yin, she began to have a strong curiosity about Wang Ling's true strength.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Then...how strong is classmate Wang Ling? Nascent Soul? Soul Formation? Or..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng suddenly stood up and said, "Have Miss Liangzi seen those containment devices in the sky? The strength of those containment creatures. Did Miss Liangzi feel it just now?"</p>

    <p>"With the strength of senior Jin Deng, I think I should be able to kill one of them instantly." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Jin Deng nodded: "If Xiao Monk responds with all his strength, he can indeed hit one with one palm. But Ling Zhenren is different."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "What's the difference?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "He is. A hundred million of them."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "???"</p>
