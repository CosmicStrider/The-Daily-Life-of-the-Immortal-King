  <h1>Chapter 1376 The old thief Ku Xuan makes sugar in the middle of the night</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Today. Jiang Xiaoche smashed two mobile phones.</p>

    <p>The first time he smashed it was because what Su Yu said to him stimulated him.</p>

    <p>The second time I smashed it was because I was rejected by Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>This incident tells us a truth.</p>

    <p>When life is unsatisfactory, you can have nothing, but you must have more mobile phones.</p>

    <p>Mainly for convenience.</p>

    <p>Nokia is no longer useful in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Unless it has been enlightened by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, as long as a cultivator with a certain level of cultivation tries to smash it, it will all break...</p>

    <p>Looking at the two broken mobile phones on the ground, Jiang Xiaoche took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had calmed down completely.</p>

    <p>And after knowing how to deal with myself and Jiang Yingying. and the relationship between myself and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Only children make choices.</p>

    <p>He wants them all!</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Jiang Xiaoche took out the third mobile phone from his pocket and started his next plan.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying's side. We still have to keep making an appointment.</p>

    <p>This was the first time he saw a girl who looked very similar to Sun Rong. It would be a pity to let her go so easily.</p>

    <p>And over there Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As Su Yu's plan failed, Jiang Xiaoche knew that he might not be able to sway this idiot with simple "seduction techniques."</p>

    <p>He began to think of a good show.</p>

    <p>Suppose. Arrange Wang Ling and Sun Rong in one place.</p>

    <p>Then both of them are in danger at the same time.</p>

    <p>If you can help me then...</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be possible to kill two birds with one stone?</p>

    <p>Ha. Just two Foundation Building phases.</p>

    <p>Create a fake crisis. This is not difficult for Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>The routine of a hero saving a beauty is certainly clich√©.</p>

    <p>But the truth is that only routines can win people's hearts!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche had already thought about the time to do it.</p>

    <p>It's next Monday. On the way home from school on the first day back at Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>Hum hum!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. If you can, don't leave after school!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With Sun Rong, after Er Ha returned from the demon world. The monk received a message from the Office of Strategic Deception. Lord Diulei wanted to discuss collecting materials for making a new Rubik's Cube. Monk Jin Deng, as the most experienced People naturally become ready-made consultants.</p>

    <p>After having the brand new Aohai.</p>

    <p>The power of the Alluring Sword. Sun Rong has already seen it.</p>

    <p>It's such a huge power that Sun Rong can't even imagine that it can be exerted from its own thin body.</p>

    <p>When the "Alluring Sword" was used.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The power contained in the body of classmate Wang Ling is probably beyond the imagination and comparison of anyone...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knows it well.</p>

    <p>The power I currently possess may be just a drop in the ocean compared to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, without the help of the monk, this is a standard of combat power that she would never be able to reach in her entire life.</p>

    <p>After seeing the power of "Alluring Sword."</p>

    <p>The girl feels that she has a sense of mission and responsibility.</p>

    <p>And. I began to understand the troubles of Wang Ling a little bit.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, she frowned slightly and couldn't help but sigh in front of the monk.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "It is really distressing to have too much power and cannot control it. I hope that classmate Wang Ling can find a way to accurately control power as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng smiled: "I will definitely find it."</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much this time, senior!" Sun Rong held Aohai in his hand and thanked him again.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun is polite. However, the poor monk still has a reminder. Please listen carefully, Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "Although Aohai's power is huge, it can be controlled. Normally, Miss Sun can suppress most enemies with just sword energy. Miss Sun's Alluring Sword is the ultimate killing move at this stage. Never use it lightly as a last resort."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior, I understand. I will definitely use this power carefully!"</p>

    <p>"Well, women should not let men down. With Miss Sun's words, the poor monk can rest assured." The monk nodded. The things that need to be explained have been explained.</p>

    <p>His "Face-Pinching Contest Commitment" can be considered officially completed and comes to an end.</p>

    <p>"Alluring Sword" is Sun Rong's current special move.</p>

    <p>In fact, if there are multiple core worlds in Aohai's body, this special move can be upgraded to another level.</p>

    <p>To build multiple core worlds into the Spirit Sword space, you need to fuse multiple Rubik's Cubes...</p>

    <p>It is not easy to get a Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and fuse it in Aohai.</p>

    <p>Multi-core spiritual sword. A monk would not even dare to think about it.</p>

    <p>If Aohai is dual-core, it can exert the power of "the most powerful sword in the world."</p>

    <p>With three cores, you can "pour the ball and strike with a sword"...</p>

    <p>But now, even if Aohai has a single core, Sun Rong is enough to use.</p>

    <p>It has really been upgraded to the three-core level.</p>

    <p>The monk felt that the spirit of the earth might go crazy.</p>

    <p>These days, a Foundation Building can be blown up with a "throwing ball and a sword." Just thinking about it makes people collapse...</p>

    <p>"Then Miss Sun, Benefactor Ha. and I will say goodbye. We have to go to the Office of Strategic Deception later."</p>

    <p>"Okay, please, senior!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held Aohai and bowed to the monk. Then he turned his eyes to Er Ha and touched Er Ha's dog head: "Er Ha. When you go back, you should also thank classmate Wang Ling for me!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha responded: "Hey! I know. You should also send a message yourself! What a big deal!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face turned red again: "I'm not. I haven't thought about it...how to tell my classmate Wang Ling!!"</p>

    <p>This feeling. Sun Rong feels that maybe Er Ha is difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>What kind of mood is it specifically? Sun Rong himself can't tell.</p>

    <p>Every time she sends a text message, she always frantically struggles with her wording. She is afraid that what she says will embarrass Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>After a few hours, it turned out to be a very simple sentence. It was revised hundreds of times. In the end, it was not sent out...it was all stored in the draft box.</p>

    <p>"Can you let me see your phone?" At this time, Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>It knows. This is actually a very rude question.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I just want to see what you have written. I can convey your meaning better!" Er Ha showed a kind smile.</p>

    <p>"That's okay...but don't flip through it." Sun Rong carefully handed over the phone.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the phone. He was shocked by the number on the text message box: "You actually typed 218?"</p>

    <p>"I...I really just didn't know what to say..."Sun Rong was also helpless.</p>

    <p>Just as she was about to take her phone back, she suddenly saw Er Ha pressing the dog's paw.</p>

    <p>"Er Ha. What are you doing!"Sun Rong quickly snatched the phone back.</p>

    <p>"Hey! It's nothing. I'm just helping you."</p>

    <p>At this time, the expression on Er Ha's face was cunning.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was anxious. His face was red: "Er Ha!! You...you...why did you send them all!!!"</p>

    <p>"You don't have the courage to send it. Let me help you. Select them all and send them. What a big deal."</p>

    <p>After finishing speaking, Er Ha tailed calmly: "Monk. Let's go!"</p>

    <p>"Okay Benefactor Ha."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded. He was suppressing a smile and looked like he was watching the fun.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Wang Ling's phone's mailbox exploded...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's text messages were sent one after another.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. This time... thank you very much..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. I seem to understand you a little. You have such huge power. It must be very painful, right?"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling! Thank you for the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube! Aohai has been upgraded! It's very useful!"</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I...like you..."</p>
