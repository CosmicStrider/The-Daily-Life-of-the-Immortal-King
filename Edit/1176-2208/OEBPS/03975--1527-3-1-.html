  <h1>Chapter 1527 Houlang Sang's Strength</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The domineering declaration of sovereignty makes many girls here intimidated.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi's realm is not as high as Golden Core, it is hampered by the Jiugong family's amazing power in Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Even though these girls were displeased with such overbearing words, they dared not speak out in anger.</p>

    <p>They were holding their breath and could only disperse one after another.</p>

    <p>In the end, only one of the girls around Wang Ling was left.</p>

    <p>At first glance, he seems to be quite stubborn.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, don't you think this is too overbearing?" The girl in Sword uniform said. She was barefoot and had a boxing bandage on her hands. She was the type who looked hard to mess with.</p>

    <p>Fighting route?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled inwardly. But the expression on his face did not show it.</p>

    <p>Because now she is Jiugong Liangzi. All the details must be imitated in place.</p>

    <p>As for physical skills, Sun Rong actually has nothing to fear.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of me looks strong.</p>

    <p>But even without the blessing of Aohai's power. Sun Rong's own physical skills are not weak either.</p>

    <p>"Hmph! Let's wait until the competition to see the real results. Classmate Matsushita Singha." Sun Rong said, imitating Jiugong Liangzi's tone.</p>

    <p>That "hum" sound seemed to perfectly verify that this person was Jiugong Liangzi himself.</p>

    <p>"Then we'll see." Matsushita Singha's chest heaved with anger.</p>

    <p>She originally wanted to curse Jiugong Liangzi, a girl with small breasts.</p>

    <p>But considering that this was in public and Houlang Sang was still there, it was really out of character to curse like that.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Jisaki in the monitoring room was very surprised by this.</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "It's strange. I remember that Rong Jiang's should be bigger than Jiugong's...Jiugong is a complete airport. But now Rong Jiang who is pretending to be Jiugong is also..."</p>

    <p>"This is because I used the spray I developed." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Spray?"</p>

    <p>"The full name is: So Cute Must Be a Blue Spray. The short name is: This is a Blue Spray."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "After using it, you can achieve the purpose of temporarily slimming and reducing breasts."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Jisaki nodded in confusion.</p>

    <p>And he suddenly felt that the Mr. Wang Xiaoer in front of him was indeed a genius.</p>

    <p>It seems like he can do everything...</p>

    <p>"It seems that this disguise plan is really well prepared." At this time, Jisaki sighed.</p>

    <p>However, he still vaguely felt that there was some small problem.</p>

    <p>For example, at this time in the venue, there was a person whose eyes always fell on Sun Rong who was disguised as Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>"It seems that classmate Ma Jiao is not having a good time..." Jisaki said worriedly.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about that."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming hehe: "The moment I saw Rongrong pretending to be Liangzi's classmate, I had already completed all the information. Jiugong Liangzi's entry and exit information, as well as student status information, etc. All of them have been temporarily moved back."</p>

    <p>"But classmate Ma Jiao is very dangerous now. And she clearly saw it, but deliberately didn't tell her. I'm afraid there is a hidden plan behind it."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry Jiucai. It doesn't matter. She can't beat Rongrong."</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang doesn't only have the Foundation Building? Even if he can unleash the power of the Golden Core..."</p>

    <p>"It's only the Foundation Building. But..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and said, "You will know later."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao thought that what he was dealing with was just a Foundation Building stage whose combat power was comparable to that of the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>But in fact...</p>

    <p>The woman she faced was the strongest Foundation Building on earth that could even be chopped down by Dao God with one sword.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The competition adopts the group system of drawing lots.</p>

    <p>Divided into groups of two duels. The artificial intelligence system will conduct a comprehensive score based on the actual situation in the duel.</p>

    <p>However, due to the sudden addition of Sun Rong, the number of participants became an odd number.</p>

    <p>When pairwise grouping cannot be achieved.</p>

    <p>Among the 63 people, 62 people will be given priority and divided into two groups to compete.</p>

    <p>The winner is directly qualified for the next round.</p>

    <p>The eliminated ones will automatically enter the loser group.</p>

    <p>Finally, according to the comprehensive score of the system, the person with the highest points in the loser group will get the right to be resurrected and fight with the final 63rd person.</p>

    <p>That is to say.</p>

    <p>First round format.</p>

    <p>It is a 31+1 competition format. In the end, 32 people will be selected to advance to the second round.</p>

    <p>After 31 people advance first, the one with the highest points will be selected from the remaining 31 people in the loser group to compete with the last person.</p>

    <p>As for who competes first and who competes last.</p>

    <p>This is also determined by automatic drawing of lots by the system.</p>

    <p>Theoretically, people who are better than others have a natural advantage.</p>

    <p>Because the games are all held in one day.</p>

    <p>Although the first place in the loser group has the privilege of resurrection, he still consumes his physical energy to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>In other words, the only person who draws the "delayed lottery" will gain a certain degree of advantage.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling always had a bad feeling after hearing about the competition system...</p>

    <p>Lottery session.</p>

    <p>On the public screen in the candidate room, the system randomly groups the 63 participants.</p>

    <p>Soon, a tree diagram of the duel was clearly laid out in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>And at the end of the tree diagram.</p>

    <p>Everyone saw the name of the person who got the delayed lottery...</p>

    <p>Wang Houlang.</p>

    <p>"Is that really the case?"</p>

    <p>"As expected of the mascot of Number 60 High School! Houlang Sang is so lucky!"</p>

    <p>Many contestants felt envious.</p>

    <p>Although this is only the first round, those who sign late have an advantage.</p>

    <p>It's almost impossible to get eliminated in the first round.</p>

    <p>There is more than 80% probability of winning.</p>

    <p>"Is there an 80% chance of winning?" At this time, in the waiting room, someone looked at the duel list and suddenly laughed.</p>

    <p>This is a blue-haired boy. He is very short, but he has a good aura.</p>

    <p>It is Lan Mao, the president of the Lanyan Club of the Rainbow Seven Sons Gang.</p>

    <p>The person he drew was not someone else.</p>

    <p>It was the Kongque man who had been following Jisaki and Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Don't look at Kongque men like this.</p>

    <p>But his strength is not bad. If the two of them compete, it will definitely be a lose-lose situation in the end.</p>

    <p>This is actually very detrimental to entering the next round.</p>

    <p>So Lan Mao thought of a way.</p>

    <p>He took the initiative to pull Kongque aside to discuss countermeasures.</p>

    <p>In the small corner, Kongque was a little surprised by Lan Mao's idea: "You mean, you want to join forces with me?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. As a condition. I can let you pass the first round smoothly. But you have to let me earn enough points."</p>

    <p>"If you are caught for match-fixing, you will be eliminated." Kongque frowned.</p>

    <p>"Who said you were going to fake the match? We are just trying to score points." Lan Mao said, "When you turn around, you can just set fireballs for me remotely. I remember that points are calculated for dodging."</p>

    <p>"A master of human body drawing..."</p>

    <p>Kongque understood instantly. But he was still a little confused: "But why did you do that?"</p>

    <p>"If the two of us fight to the death for the first round, the risk of entering the second round will be extremely high."</p>

    <p>Lan Mao said: "In this case, why don't we put on a show? You will advance smoothly, and I can also deal with the mascot who is not that risky..."</p>

    <p>Kongque was stunned.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that the president of the Lanyan Club would choose to take such a route in order to advance smoothly.</p>

    <p>But since I have made up my mind to go this way.</p>

    <p>Does it mean that Lan Mao has subconsciously labeled Houlang Sang as "very weak?"</p>

    <p>Although Houlang Sang does have the title of mascot at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>But Kongque felt that Wang Ling might not be as weak as he thought.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Kongque. I heard that Houlang Sang didn't have a good rest last night. His breath is very weak today. I'm confident enough to win against him."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lan Mao smiled confidently: "As long as you help me, it will be fine. And in this way, both of us can save enough energy for the next round, right?"</p>

    <p>Kongque thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>Finally. He nodded.</p>

    <p>Because this matter is not too bad for him anyway.</p>

    <p>After all, you are guaranteed to advance to the next round.</p>

    <p>It's just that Lan Mao chose this roundabout way to enter the next round.</p>

    <p>He still felt puzzled.</p>

    <p>This was obviously a decision made because he was confident that he could beat Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>But what if... what if we lose?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although the venue is not big, the competition can be completed today.</p>

    <p>Two venues. Two fields. There are artificial intelligence referee balls suspended in the air to monitor and evaluate the game in all aspects.</p>

    <p>Including the final system comprehensive score. It is also played by the referee.</p>

    <p>At the same time, during the duel, the game screen will be simultaneously projected into the waiting room.</p>

    <p>So far. Wang Ling has not played against foreign students.</p>

    <p>The teaching styles of cultivators from various countries are very different. Therefore, many of them have their own characteristics and even originality in combat.</p>

    <p>For example, the cultivators on Sun Island. In their teaching from childhood to adulthood, they often implant some ideas from the ACG industry into their spells...</p>

    <p>Convert some things seen in anime into real spells.</p>

    <p>This is also an eye-opener for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For example, on the public screen in the candidate room, the battle between the two sides is going on fiercely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like I'm watching anime.</p>

    <p>The fast strikes with shadowy punches, counterattacks, and all kinds of gorgeous and familiar fighting skills...Wang Ling all have a familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>In the first round of the competition, Matsushita Singha, the classmate who challenged Sun Rong before. Although she was not directly drawn into a group with Sun Rong, the boy who faced her was beaten badly.</p>

    <p>Because as soon as the show started, Matsushita Singha entered the three-tail mode!</p>

    <p>He actually improved his combat power by tying himself into a ponytail!</p>

    <p>In fact. This is a scalp acupoint stimulation method!</p>

    <p>When tying a ponytail, if it is tied tightly enough, the tightly bound hair roots can have an effect similar to that of a gold acupuncture point.</p>

    <p>Accelerate the blood flow in the body, thereby making the spiritual power run faster than before.</p>

    <p>However, practicing this technique requires strict training of the scalp from an early age.</p>

    <p>Because the act of tying a ponytail actually damages the scalp.</p>

    <p>If the scalp is not strong enough, you will often become bald as you practice.</p>

    <p>"It's not over yet! Get up!" Matsushita Singha grabbed the boy's collar. His posture was full of firepower. It was intimidating.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's attitude towards herself before she was angry.</p>

    <p>Isn't she just the eldest lady? What's so great about it!</p>

    <p>Why do you say Houlang Sang is hers!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was puzzled by such behavior. But Wang Ming and Jisaki in the control room understood it very well.</p>

    <p>This is a war between women...</p>

    <p>An angry girl is often very scary.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the life safety of the boy playing against me.</p>

    <p>In the end, Matsushita Singha's game was forced to stop.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong's game went relatively smoothly.</p>

    <p>Looking at the girl who was beaten away like a scarecrow. Sun Rong originally wanted to step forward and help her.</p>

    <p>But suddenly I thought that the person I was playing now was Jiugong Liangzi...</p>

    <p>If it was just Jiugong, he probably wouldn't have walked over and helped him up.</p>

    <p>She is trying to figure out Jiugong Liangzi's thinking.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, he cautiously took his steps forward and finally extended his hand to the girl: "Huh! I'm not here to help you! I'm just passing by!"</p>

    <p>In the waiting room. Wang Ling couldn't help but clapped her hands gently.</p>

    <p>This acting is so realistic...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were 31 groups of games. It lasted about 10 hours in total.</p>

    <p>Everything was as Lan Mao expected. By cooperating with Kongque to repeatedly score dodge points, Lan Mao's overall points became the first in the loser group.</p>

    <p>When the words Lan Mao VS Wang Houlang are displayed on the public screen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that it was time for him to appear.</p>

    <p>"Come on Houlang Sang! You have an 80% winning rate! Don't let us down!"</p>

    <p>"You can do it Houlang Sang!" Beat this blue guy! Because the dyed hair animation can't be aired! So you must defeat him!"</p>

    <p>"President! For our Lanyan Club, you must hold on!"</p>

    <p>At the scene, there were endless calls.</p>

    <p>There are people cheering for Wang Ling. There are also members of the Lanyan Club who are especially cheering for Lan Mao.</p>

    <p>Because Talisman's body is covered with seals. Wang Ling felt a sense of peace of mind for the first time.</p>

    <p>He finally didn't have to worry about blowing someone's head off accidentally when fighting alone...</p>

    <p>But in fact. Wang Ling has not completely relaxed.</p>

    <p>After all, I have an incomplete version of Talisman on me. Maybe it will explode at some point. It will emit smoke like a firecracker...</p>

    <p>He glanced lazily at Lan Mao in front of him. He felt that the other person's aura was pitifully weak.</p>

    <p>But seeing Lan Mao looking so confident, Wang Ling couldn't say anything to attack him.</p>

    <p>This is the first round. The last group is dueling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lan Mao stood on the fighting stage.</p>

    <p>He saw Lan Mao in front of him smiling at him: "Houlang Sang's luck is really good. He actually got the delayed lottery. But it's a pity. Your opponent is me. So you will lose this time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shrugged and put his hands in his trouser pockets. He didn't care about Lan Mao's nonsense at all.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao continued to smile: "Look at your calm look. You still have your hands in your trouser pockets. In fact, your palms are already sweating because of nervousness, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In fact, regardless of winning or losing, Houlang Sang can come to participate in the competition. In my opinion, it is a great courage."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Our country's college student rankings. Wouldn't it be too shameful for you, a foreign student, to be at the top?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling continues to be silent.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao's endless chatter did not irritate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said it a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Overconfidence. Just stupidity.</p>

    <p>However, people like Lan Mao are also narrow-minded and narrow-minded because of the limitations of their realm...</p>

    <p>Maybe in other people's eyes.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao is a very strong Golden Core young genius.</p>

    <p>But in Wang Ling's view, the Lan Mao in front of him is essentially a mortal.</p>

    <p>As a mortal...you certainly can't expect him to understand things beyond his own dimension of power.</p>

    <p>How do you say something?</p>

    <p>Don't look at how happy you are now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling makes a list with you.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling himself has no desire to win or lose.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for the triple kill plan to draw out Peng Xiren, get the prize money and the crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>He wouldn't even enter the race.</p>

    <p>"Is Houlang Sang ready?"</p>

    <p>At this moment. Lan Mao showed a kind smile. Looking at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Originally, in Lan Mao's eyes, this was just a game of abuse.</p>

    <p>Since it's a game. You could even say it's a recreational game. So there's no need to be so tense.</p>

    <p>After asking politely.</p>

    <p>The next thing to greet Wang Ling is a move from Lan Mao called "Fa Lian Hua."</p>

    <p>This is a physical technique with a very high degree of difficulty.</p>

    <p>The key point is to sprint over quickly with your body skills, go around behind the enemy, suddenly pick up the enemy and use your amazing jumping power to carry him into the sky, and then use your rapidly extending hair to wrap around the person!</p>

    <p>Finally, a high-speed death spiral formed in the air and hit the ground!</p>

    <p>This move is Lan Mao's most proficient in all physical skills.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, it is more than enough to deal with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Under the impact of such a spin in the air, the mascot of Number 60 High School would definitely be unable to bear it and faint!</p>

    <p>His speed is extremely fast.</p>

    <p>Almost in the blink of an eye, he was already behind Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Ha!" Lan Mao shouted loudly. He used a strongman lock to lock Wang Ling's shoulders. He tried to use his own jumping power to take Wang Ling off the ground!</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>{Fa Lianhua} The most important point is to take your opponent off the ground!</p>

    <p>But now. Lan Mao found himself experiencing some technical difficulties...</p>

    <p>He couldn't lift Wang Ling up at all!</p>

    <p>"Fuck!" Lan Mao was so suppressed that his face turned red. At the same time, he couldn't help but cursed in his heart!</p>

    <p>This Wang Houlang. He looks so weak! He is so thin! How can he weigh so much!</p>

    <p>Many people in the waiting room also exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"How could it be possible? Classmate Lan Mao can't even lift Houlang Sang! Fa Lian Hua failed before it even started?"</p>

    <p>"I just said that Houlang Sang is extraordinary! He must have seen through this trick a long time ago, so he used the Thousand Jin Pendant!"</p>

    <p>"No! Even if it's a thousand-jin drop, Houlang Sang is only in the Foundation Building stage after all. How could Lan Mao not be able to lift him?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This is a very strange scene.</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at the scene in front of them. The expressions on their faces were all at a loss.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the person who was at a loss was Lan Mao himself.</p>

    <p>Can't lift Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This was something he didn't expect.</p>

    <p>I thought about how many people were staring at me in the waiting room.</p>

    <p>His actions must be particularly embarrassing now. Lan Mao suddenly felt his face getting hot.</p>

    <p>In the end, he had no choice but to give up his move of {{ID_00004}}. He used Wang Ling's unshakable body as a pedal. He kicked Wang Ling's back violently and stood in place with a handsome posture. Take off to cover up your embarrassment.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. What Lan Mao didn't expect was...</p>

    <p>The next second. The backlash effect of Wang Ling has been transmitted...</p>

    <p>There was a bang! The right foot that Lan Mao just kicked was fractured on the spot.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling is thankful.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ming added many seals to Talisman.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, just with the strength of that kick, Lan Mao's lower body would be broken into pieces like shit.</p>

    <p>After landing, Lan Mao realized that his right foot was broken. Not to mention how aggrieved he felt.</p>

    <p>The key is that he was still holding back and didn't scream directly.</p>

    <p>Between him and Wang Ling. It was the last match.</p>

    <p>There were so many pairs of eyes watching in the waiting room. How dare he scream out in pain!</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang...you forced me to do this..." Lan Mao took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>His chest heaved. He was a little angry.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of Wang Ling, this is more like a kind of incompetent rage.</p>

    <p>Because he lost the combat effectiveness of one leg, Lan Mao must find a new way to attack as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Then. Under the astonished eyes of everyone.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao suddenly stood on his head and shouted loudly: "Start! Super transformation!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, he used his hands instead of his feet and rushed towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He used his right foot in the air to continuously twist his ankle in the air and began to condense a ball-shaped object with high-density psychic energy.</p>

    <p>Such a spiritual energy pill was originally rubbed out by hand.</p>

    <p>But now the use of the hands has replaced the use of the feet. Lan Mao had no choice but to use this method.</p>

    <p>As an outstanding practitioner of special spiritual roots with wind attribute spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>Even under such circumstances, he was able to use his own spiritual root attributes. He thought of using his ankles instead of his wrists to quickly rotate and create such a spiritual pill with huge lethality and destructive power...</p>

    <p>Such a fighting mentality made Wang Ling secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>However, Lan Mao's speed is too slow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling concentrated his energy. He ducked sideways and avoided Lan Mao's attack.</p>

    <p>It's not because he's afraid of pain.</p>

    <p>Mainly because he was afraid of the backlash on his body, so he also disabled Lan Mao's other leg.</p>

    <p>Lan Mao just kicked him with his right foot. Even in his safe mode with layers of seals, he still suffered a fracture.</p>

    <p>And if this psychic ball hits him.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Lan Mao will have to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life...</p>

    <p>After all, it is just the first round of group matches within Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>Risking the rest of your life. Wang Ling doesn't think it's necessary.</p>

    <p>However. The moment Wang Ling avoided it.</p>

    <p>He could also feel the broken traces of the "Incomplete Seal of Talisman" on his body.</p>

    <p>Wisps of smoke began to appear on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even when Wang Ling does nothing.</p>

    <p>Still have Talisman broken...</p>

    <p>This is?!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lan Mao looked at the smoldering Wang Ling with an unbelievable look. Lan Mao looked at the smoldering Wang Ling with an incredulous look: "Second... Second Stage?"</p>

    <p>"It's... This can't be! It can't be!"</p>

    <p>He practically roared. His face was stained red from the intense churning of blood.</p>

    <p>The teenager in front of me...</p>

    <p>He's not as weak as he thought he was.</p>

    <p>The boy. It's like a very complicated math problem.</p>

    <p>Now Lan Mao has finally found it...</p>

    <p>It's a little out of the box for him. It's a bit of an overreach.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>He's obviously.</p>

    <p>He didn't do anything.</p>

    <p>What's the second stage of the goddamned thing?</p>
