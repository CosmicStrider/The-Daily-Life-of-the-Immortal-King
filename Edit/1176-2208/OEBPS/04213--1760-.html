  <h1>Chapter 1760 Schr√∂dinger's Father</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in Glio City, Mixiu Country, in a unique metal tree-shaped building called the Wisdom Tree, a secret roundtable meeting was going on.</p>

    <p>This was originally a landmark building in Mixiu Country Glio City. It was founded by a cultivator headhunting company called "Xu Ze."</p>

    <p>In recent years, Xu Ze has become famous in the name of "Talent Resource Balance." The main purpose is to complete the talent checks and balances among many sects. He is specifically responsible for recruiting talents to poach people.</p>

    <p>Each major cultivation sect actually has its own talent reserve plan. This includes the Office of Strategic Deception as well.</p>

    <p>Previously, Li Huayu of the Tianquan Sect, whom Crispy Noodles Dao Lord was interested in, had already been making intensive preparations and contacts in secret. The main reason why it was done in secret was to avoid alerting the enemy.</p>

    <p>For example, it was so alarming that a headhunting firm like Xu Ze came in as a "spoiler" to disrupt the situation.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that Xu Ze, who is famous for his headhunting work, is actually one of the biggest intelligence traders behind the scenes...</p>

    <p>For example, the current Wisdom Tree Roundtable Conference is also called the "Full Moon Conference." Tengu from all over the world gather at this conference.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the level of all Tengu is above the fifth level.</p>

    <p>When the curse on Yin Hu failed to take effect according to the normal process, the Tengu quickly received the news because it was necessary to discuss the matter immediately.</p>

    <p>At the round table meeting, all Tengu were wearing the familiar Jason mask. The stars on their foreheads symbolized their rank. One star represented a rank.</p>

    <p>The Tengu sitting around here at this moment all have at least five stars on their foreheads.</p>

    <p>"The person who rescued Miss Jiang was sent by the Office of Strategic Deception. Maybe they saw through the curse on the Yin Hu. The other party also took the initiative to remove the curse on the Yin Hu."</p>

    <p>"So. Yin Hu has most likely betrayed us."</p>

    <p>"It's not very possible. He has betrayed us. He managed to survive. This is the only way to save his life."</p>

    <p>"What do you think of Emperor Zun..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, all the tengu in the round table fell silent.</p>

    <p>The emperor here refers to the only tenth-grade tengu among the tengu.</p>

    <p>Almost all major intelligence messages are conveyed implicitly or explicitly from the "Emperor." However, no one has seen the appearance of this Emperor. Currently among the entire Tengu queue, that is. There is only one tenth-grade tengu.</p>

    <p>"I have sent a message to Emperor Zun. But now, I have not received a response... But I want to express my opinion. It is best to eliminate the root cause of this matter."</p>

    <p>"That master of the Office of Strategic Deception can lift the curse. Even the doomsday straw crow woven by the senior does not cause fear. It is not that easy to kill her."</p>

    <p>"Wool, after all, comes from the sheep. If the sheep is gone, the wool will become useless."</p>

    <p>At this time, a tengu with eight stars on his forehead spoke.</p>

    <p>"Ha. Master Ba. He is still as domineering as ever."</p>

    <p>Another seven-star Tengu. He continued: "Although we have been planning to split the Office of Strategic Deception for a long time, I don't think this is the best time to take action."</p>

    <p>"Then, let's vote according to the old rules. Those who support splitting the Office of Strategic Deception will raise their hands respectively with those who do not support it. Finally, count the stars on both sides. In the end, the opinion of the party with the higher number of stars will be adopted..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time that a group of fifth-grade and above tengu in the Wisdom Tree launched a vote, a small figure carrying a small schoolbag appeared on the streets of Duobao City.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu took nothing with him when he went out. He just packed some of his favorite snacks and left. As for the reason for going out, it was actually different from the rumors.</p>

    <p>Muyu is not a completely ignorant child. "Mom" is busy rescuing people and has no time to see him. It's not that he can't understand.</p>

    <p>The reason why I came here is mainly because I am worried about the safety of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After all, he only has one "mother."</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the Star Dragon gene in his body.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but use the dragon power of the Star Dragon to calculate a fortune, and things like today would not have happened. The results of the divination were not good, so he had to make this trip.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Muyu is not stupid.</p>

    <p>This Duobao City is not a place where children should come.</p>

    <p>He knew that if he appeared here in the body of a child, he would definitely attract attention. At that time, not only would he not be able to help, but he might even be of hindrance.</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, Wang Muyu's ultimate wish is to strengthen the relationship between himself, Wang Ling, and Sun Rong. He does not want to make these two people hate him.</p>

    <p>Although he had previously said that if Wang Ling didn't come to see him, he would broadcast to the world that he was Wang Ling's son... but that was just a statement. He didn't dare to really do that.</p>

    <p>Therefore, on the way to Duobao City, Wang Muyu's heart was extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>He is only six years old.</p>

    <p>But they have to shoulder the important task of maintaining family relationships.</p>

    <p>It is really too difficult!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before officially entering the territory of Duobao City, he used the dragon genes of the "Fat House Dragon" to expand his body a bit and turned into the appearance of a young man. And he was also a big fat man. It was different from his original appearance.</p>

    <p>As a result, he smelled the scent of an acquaintance within a few steps of entering the place.</p>

    <p>It smells like daddy...</p>

    <p>He believes that his judgment will not be wrong.</p>

    <p>After all, as a combination of the outstanding genes of the Dragon Clan, Wang Muyu is particularly sensitive to the perception and judgment of combat power. The combat power of all opponents can almost be converted into specific values in his mind through breath perception.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling is an exception.</p>

    <p>The perception of Wang Ling in his mind is not a specific numerical value.</p>

    <p>But "???"</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>This is very spiritual. Three question marks.</p>

    <p>At first, Wang Muyu thought there was something wrong with his perception system.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until later that he saw the scene where Wang Ling beat Jingze that he realized it.</p>

    <p>It's not that there's a problem with my perception system. It's that his father is really strong!</p>

    <p>Eh? Now that dad is here, mom shouldn't be in danger?</p>

    <p>As a hidden boss whose combat power is displayed as three "???", the moment Wang Muyu saw Wang Ling, he instinctively felt at ease.</p>

    <p>He did not choose to take the initiative to say hello, because he saw Wang Ling being taken away by an old man wearing a facial mask. If he went over to meet him now, he would probably cause trouble to his father, right?</p>

    <p>So Wang Muyu thought like this.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Ling followed Martial Saint Jiang into the underground intelligence trading market that he walked up to Zhou Ziyi, who was disguised as the owner of the Lingzhi Store.</p>

    <p>He walked over cautiously and said to Zhou Ziyi: "Excuse me..."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi had a question mark on his face.</p>

    <p>He does know about Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>But now that Wang Muyu has become like this, he would never have thought that the person standing in front of him was Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"You gave daddy's a mask. Can you give me one too?" Wang Muyu asked politely.</p>

    <p>"Daddy?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was stunned when he heard this.</p>

    <p>His first reaction was shock.</p>

    <p>Because he has never heard that Martial Saint Jiang actually has a son...</p>

    <p>"Your father is Martial Saint?" Zhou Ziyi confirmed in a low voice.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he looked carefully at Wang Muyu up and down. He felt that this young man looked a bit familiar, but he couldn't say that he looked very similar to Martial Saint.</p>

    <p>"Martial Saint?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu murmured in his heart. He didn't know that Martial Saint was referring to Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>Since Martial Saint means strong fighter.</p>

    <p>That means he can fight very well!</p>

    <p>And his father is indeed very good at fighting!</p>

    <p>Immediately, Wang Muyu nodded: "Yes. He is Martial Saint."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi shook his head: "But this is just your one-sided statement..."</p>

    <p>"This is easy."</p>

    <p>Then Wang Muyu nodded.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Zhou Ziyi only felt that the scene in front of him changed. Everyone on the street disappeared! But the scene layout of Duobao City was still the same!</p>

    <p>"You...what did you do?" Zhou Ziyi asked in shock.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. It just divides the space into layers. This is a layered space. It won't affect the real world."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu smiled and said: "Don't you want me to prove it? My father is very good at fighting. I am also very good at fighting!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves, revealing his fists as big as sandbags, and punched the ground hard...</p>
