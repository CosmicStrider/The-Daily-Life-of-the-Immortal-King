  <h1>Chapter 1984 The strange vice principal</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although monks never disdain to compete with secular people, the experience of so many reincarnations always gives monks an immersive sense of immersion in the role they currently play.</p>

    <p>He is not a monk now. He is the vice principal and mathematics teacher of Number 60 High School. So he must protect the reputation of the school, preserve the face of all Number 60 High School teachers, and most importantly, protect all the students here. The important task of this job now.</p>

    <p>He had also heard of the name of Crazy Demon Dai. He was born in the martial arts battlefield in the chaotic war years. He then became famous in one fell swoop. He had achieved many first-class and even special-class merits.</p>

    <p>The enemies he killed could even be piled up to form a mountain.</p>

    <p>However, in the early years of peacetime, Dai Kuangmo, who had great military exploits, was not reused. The reason was that he insisted on going his own way on the battlefield. He repeatedly disobeyed orders and went against the wind. Although he created many miracles of winning battles with fewer people, he could. Such a disobedient person is indeed an important blow to the overall strategic plan.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in the early days of the peace era, Dai Tianchun was left out in the cold for a long time. The ten generals all thought that he was too young and energetic at the time, so he repeatedly disobeyed orders and took risks.</p>

    <p>So they temporarily left Dai Tianchun in the cold, hoping to make his temperament more stable...</p>

    <p>Then, the famous general Dai Tianchun, who was born in the military legacy battlefield, was re-activated. It was already a thousand years after the beginning of the peaceful era.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals conducted a re-evaluation and found that Dai Tianchun's character was indeed more stable than before. And more than that. They also found that during the period of immersion, Dai Tianchun actually started researching scientific magic weapons at the same time. He repeatedly came up with shocking surprises. world research results.</p>

    <p>At this point, I can't seem to find any other reason to hide Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>Then, Shengke... was officially established. And Dai Tianchun took over Shengke from the beginning. He is the first generation principal at that time and continues to this day.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought that this legendary general had become more stable. As a result, in the secret realm of the group training of the principals of various schools, he once again showed his characteristics of wearing a crazy devil and beat the principals of each school to the ground. Be merciful.</p>

    <p>From a ten-year perspective, Dai Tianchun's move is more like a way of venting his anger for many years. He has a weird personality, like an old kid who never grows up, full of desire to win and a competitive spirit.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School Conference Center. After listening to the monk's words, all the teachers opened their mouths. They did not expect that the vice principal's school years would be so vast. They could understand so clearly about Dai Tianchun. history.</p>

    <p>But knowledge is knowledge...</p>

    <p>The question now is, if two people take action, what will be the consequences? Because the outcome is actually very crucial.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan frowned: "Vice Principal Huo. You should know the stakes of this principal duel... This Dai Tianchun just wants to attack our Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know it. This is a threat."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded and said calmly: "As far as I know, he not only issued a challenge letter to our Number 60 High School, but also issued a challenge letter to Jingmen Number 8 High School, which is also ranked second in Jinghua City. This move. In fact, it is a threat."</p>

    <p>"Just for that Qu Shuling?" a teacher asked doubtfully.</p>

    <p>"This is a student he spent a huge amount of resources to cultivate. Because he made a mistake in this spiritual world trial, today's news came out... If he doesn't take action to express his attitude, then this Qu The result faced by the students is to be hidden in the snow." The monk's words hit the nail on the head and made all the teachers in the room suddenly realize.</p>

    <p>It turns out that what Dai Tianchun did was because he saw the shadow of his former self in Qu Shuling...</p>

    <p>In this way, it doesn't seem so strange as to why this crazy Dai suddenly took action.</p>

    <p>Now, in the absence of Principal Chen, all the teachers have no choice but to place their hopes on the new Vice Principal Huo.</p>

    <p>Although no one has actually seen the scene where Vice Colonel Huo took action, and they don't know how strong this Vice Colonel Huo is... but judging from Vice Colonel Huo's words.</p>

    <p>This man who suddenly entered Number 60 High School and became the vice-principal was filled with a sense of mystery. "No...but I can play with him..."</p>

    <p>The teachers couldn't help but think of the scene that just happened.</p>

    <p>Is this what a normal person would say?</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan. Do you think Vice Principal Huo is reliable?" After the meeting, a teacher communicated with Teacher Pan in private.</p>

    <p>"I don't know...but I don't know why. Vice Principal Huo suddenly gave me a feeling..." Teacher Pan said.</p>

    <p>"What does it feel like?"</p>

    <p>"Sixty Sweeping Monks..."</p>

    <p>"It would be great if this was really a sweeping monk."</p>

    <p>Many teachers couldn't help but laugh. In this current situation, we can only take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>After all, the principal is a master in dueling. The leaders at the top will not just sit idly by.</p>

    <p>Not long after the monk left the conference center, he heard the teachers talking about him privately.</p>

    <p>Sweeping monk?...</p>

    <p>The monk scratched his head.</p>

    <p>He felt that his acting was pretty good. He looked like a vice principal.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why. Suddenly he returned to his original role.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>It seems that this time, he is acting in his true colors...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of the Principal of Shengke. Dai Tianchun has received the impression of Number 60 High School. His hair is long and messy, and the white mane has been densely distributed along the temples on the lower half of his face. From a distance, he looks calm and intimidating. Bring your own. A fierce image. Like a silver lion shrouded in thunder and lightning.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Number 60 High School dared to take on the challenge. This was a bit beyond his imagination... Although Number 60 High School was not ranked high, the development of Number 60 High School in recent years has attracted Dai Tianchun's full attention.</p>

    <p>Especially there is always a seed in his heart...</p>

    <p>I really want to have a good competition with Chen Xiaozong from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>After all, in the circle of principals, there are not many principals who have not been beaten up by him. And Chen Xiaozong of Number 60 High School is actually one.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Dai Tianchun learned that the person fighting this time was not Chen Xiaozong, but Huo Ding, the new vice principal of Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>"Taking a vice-principal to confront me. Does this mean you are looking down on me?" Dai Tianchun immediately felt a trace of anger in his heart.</p>

    <p>Especially after he carefully investigated the information about Vice Principal Huo Ding, he felt as if a fish bone was stuck in his throat.</p>

    <p>A vice principal. All experience is completely blank. He only stated that he had been an intern in the Office of Strategic Deception for a period of time...</p>

    <p>Take an intern as the vice principal. Do you dare to accept his challenge?</p>

    <p>This is more than just looking down on him.</p>

    <p>This is completely crushing his dignity as the principal of Shengke to the ground...</p>

    <p>At this time, Dai Tianchun's mane covered his head automatically without any wind.</p>

    <p>There was only one idea in his head - to level. Number 60 High School!</p>
