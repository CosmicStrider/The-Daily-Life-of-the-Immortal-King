  <h1>Chapter 1520 In one thought</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The white knife goes in, the red knife comes out...</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao has always been particular about cleanliness and neatness in her work.</p>

    <p>Being sloppy is definitely not her style. And because she has ample experience in killing people.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao moved her hands like a ghost. When she finished circling around, these two idle people hired by Jiugong Xiushi were stabbed in the waist by one of them on the spot.</p>

    <p>Both of them looked horrified at the same time.</p>

    <p>It is said that the students of Jiudaohe High School develop very early. Some people have arrived at Golden Core before graduating.</p>

    <p>But the appearance of Ma Jiao still gave them a lot of experience...</p>

    <p>The upper level of the Golden Core. The strength of such a state is beyond their imagination. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is shocking.</p>

    <p>"This girl...has something to say!"</p>

    <p>However, Ma Jiao's knife was not fatal.</p>

    <p>Both of them were Jianghu people. They reacted quickly. They endured the pain and quickly retreated to distance themselves.</p>

    <p>At the same time, they quickly took two pills. One was for stopping bleeding and the other was for detoxification.</p>

    <p>This is to prevent the knife from being coated with poison and narcotic type psychedelic drugs.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao didn't speak. Her face was gloomy. She was simply scarier than the female ghost among some ghosts.</p>

    <p>She held the dagger left and right. Blood dripped down the tip of the dagger. It fell to the ground bit by bit. Then it bloomed like a bloody flower.</p>

    <p>"Get out!" One of the two men, who looked older, said.</p>

    <p>It can actually be seen just from the amount of hair. This person is the commander of this operation.</p>

    <p>When the order to retreat was given, the two men acted quickly. They opened the window on the seventh floor and planned to jump directly from above.</p>

    <p>The distance is only the 7th floor. The cultivators in Golden Core will not die because of this few floors.</p>

    <p>They were about to jump down when Ma Jiao stabbed them again with a knife, which was firmly pierced into their calves. The tip of the knife penetrated the calf flesh and penetrated into the wall, nailing them firmly to the window sill like nails.</p>

    <p>The two people instinctively wanted to scream in pain. However, thinking that their screams might cause a commotion in the entire building, they gritted their teeth and held back.</p>

    <p>Behind them, a devil-like girl approached. The two of them quickly pulled out the dagger from their legs without even having time to think about it.</p>

    <p>He jumped down from the 7th floor as if he was running away.</p>

    <p>It's like going through a horror game.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that there would be such a crazy woman in a boys' dormitory...</p>

    <p>"Gan! I knew this girl was abnormal!" The Mediterranean man named the leader gritted his teeth in pain.</p>

    <p>"Did you just run away? What about the mission?"</p>

    <p>"Are you still thinking about the mission at this time? Of course it is important to save your life! That little lunatic just now had a chance to kill us. But neither of the two knives penetrated the vital part... This was obviously intentional..."</p>

    <p>The Mediterranean man was filled with fear: "I'm afraid the other party wants to torture us to death bit by bit..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact, this is not wrong.</p>

    <p>Tortured to death. But Ma Jiao had this intention.</p>

    <p>At the edge of the window sill. Ma Jiao stared at the ground and the dripping blood on the edge of the window sill. She couldn't help but stick out her tongue and lick the bits of blood that splashed on the corners of her lips.</p>

    <p>What a pity. These two people ran too fast. She originally wanted to drill a few holes in their calves with the dagger...</p>

    <p>She is obviously the real hunter.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Houlang Sang belongs to her.</p>

    <p>And Houlang Sang's life must be left to her to end in person...</p>

    <p>This is the task assigned to her by her most respected senior, Old V!</p>

    <p>No one can stop it!</p>

    <p>Everyone who steals the mission will die...</p>

    <p>"Run? Can you run away?"</p>

    <p>Seeing the two people fleeing in a hurry, Ma Jiao sneered.</p>

    <p>Just like what two people thought.</p>

    <p>She fiddled with the dagger.</p>

    <p>But it's fine to paint.</p>

    <p>It's not poison.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The two kidnappers who were sent by Jiugong Xiushi to hire Wang Ling chose to evacuate immediately after being attacked by Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>Their retreat route was determined beforehand, so they ran very fast during their retreat.</p>

    <p>In the early morning, on the corner a few streets away from Jiudaohe High School, the two quickly boarded a black van.</p>

    <p>"Did the mission fail?" At this time, a voice came from the driver's seat.</p>

    <p>There was another accomplice of theirs in the van.</p>

    <p>"Jiudaohe High School is so scary. There is a little crazy girl who keeps chasing us and killing us..." the two said with lingering fear.</p>

    <p>They took out the first aid kit and were cleaning and further bandaging the wounds on their bodies.</p>

    <p>"Master, will you be very angry?"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! Because the original plan to kidnap the man named Wang was to threaten Sun Rong-chan! Now the plan has failed. He must be angry."</p>

    <p>Mediterranean man treating his wounds.</p>

    <p>At this point, he suddenly felt that something was wrong with the driver today.</p>

    <p>Just when he was suspicious.</p>

    <p>At this time, the driver in the driving seat spoke again: "Do you think I talked too much today?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lao Chai. You don't seem to talk that much usually."</p>

    <p>"Do you feel a little dizzy now?"</p>

    <p>"When you say that, it seems a bit..." The Mediterranean man frowned.</p>

    <p>At this time, he looked at the accomplice who was acting with him. Suddenly he found that this person had already fainted and was foaming at the mouth.</p>

    <p>"When I stabbed the knife in, there was indeed no poison on it. However, the potion on the knife would conflict with the elixir that has a hemostatic effect, thus turning it into a hallucinogen."</p>

    <p>In the driving seat. As the driver finished speaking, the middle-aged Mediterranean man suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a strong smell of blood came. Following the smell of blood, he looked towards the back of the van.</p>

    <p>The Mediterranean men discovered that their real driver had fallen into the back compartment.</p>

    <p>He was covered in blood. He had completely fallen into a pool of blood...</p>

    <p>"You...you are..." At this moment, the middle-aged man suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by the sound of blood dripping, the driver in the driver's seat suddenly turned around. Then he took off his mask. His mouth suddenly cracked: "Did the person who stabbed you earlier look like this?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man could no longer resist the effects of the "psychedelic drug." With his face full of panic, he passed out with a pale face.</p>

    <p>"Three kills. Complete..."</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao closed her eyes. She smelled the bloody smell in the van, and suddenly felt a sense of peace of mind in her heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in dormitory 704, Wang Ling opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>After the observation just now, he is now certain that the vice president of the student union of Jiudaohe High School, like Jiugong Xinghui, the eldest daughter of the Zhai Xing Group, is a combination of ghosts and humans.</p>

    <p>And the degree of combination is very high. Except for the smell of ghosts that will appear at specific times, the smell of Ma Jiao in normal life is undoubtedly the smell of humans.</p>

    <p>At present, it is known that the technology for combining ghosts and human cultivators was jointly developed by Zhai Xing Group and the Silverskin Man.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling thought to himself. Maybe the reason why Ma Jiao became what he is today is also inextricably related to the research of Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui is the daughter of Akano Sekitora. To combine a ghost with his daughter, without certainty, Akano Sekitora will definitely not use this technique easily.</p>

    <p>To do this, he needs a large number of test subjects...</p>

    <p>And Ma Jiao. is one of them.</p>

    <p>The above.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not Wang Ling's own unilateral guess.</p>

    <p>Because now, sitting cross-legged in front of him, the three intact people who were rescued from Ma Jiao by Wang Ling also told him everything they knew.</p>

    <p>"Senior! These are all the things we know!" At this time, the three people kowtowed to Wang Ling. They could not see clearly what Wang Ling looked like.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's aura is powerful. It makes the three of them fearful.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment Ma Jiao stabbed her for the first time...</p>

    <p>The power of King's Eyes of Wang Ling has been activated.</p>

    <p>He uses his pupil power to distort the boundary between reality and illusion.</p>

    <p>As a result, everything that just happened was "reality" in Ma Jiao's eyes. But in the eyes of the three middle-aged Mediterranean people, it was all "dream"...</p>

    <p>In this world.</p>

    <p>Everything is and is not.</p>

    <p>All true and false.</p>

    <p>It's all in Wang Ling. Just a thought...</p>
