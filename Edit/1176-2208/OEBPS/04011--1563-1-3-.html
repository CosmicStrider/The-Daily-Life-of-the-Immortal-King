  <h1>Chapter 1563 1 family of 3</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>On the way back, Jiugong Liangzi was sitting in the passenger seat. From time to time, he looked through the rearview mirror at the excited Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>She keenly noticed that Zhou Ziyi's eyes had been falling on Zhuo Yi since she got in the car.</p>

    <p>"Don't you always think that the passenger seat is not spacious enough? Why do you want to sit next to me?"</p>

    <p>Not long after setting off. Zhuo Yi laughed suddenly.</p>

    <p>He looked straight ahead without squinting. He only used his peripheral vision to glance at the girl with her arms folded and her head slightly raised, looking like a black swan.</p>

    <p>"I can sit wherever I want. Hum." Jiugong Liangzi turned and looked out the window. Her eyes never stopped. She stared thoughtfully at Zhou Ziyi in the back seat through the reflection in the window.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she doesn't hate Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>Even after I came into contact with Zhou Ziyi for the first time, I deeply admired Zhou Ziyi's courage to smile and face life.</p>

    <p>But she didn't know why. Her eyes kept falling on Zhuo Yi when she looked at Zhou Ziyi. She just felt uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>She knew very well that that look was definitely not a look of love... but purely out of admiration for her idol.</p>

    <p>But no matter how she tried to convince herself, Jiugong Liangzi still felt as if there was always air blocking her cardiovascular system, making it impossible for her to calm down.</p>

    <p>Ever since she hired a bodyguard like Zhuo Yi, she found that she began to become more and more... abnormal...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held both hands on the steering wheel. He couldn't help but smile as he stared at the sulking girl beside him.</p>

    <p>Liangzi is so cute...</p>

    <p>This is a girl who can't hide her temper. She thinks she is very mature, but in fact, she has already written all her inner thoughts on her face.</p>

    <p>The idea of bringing Zhou Ziyi back to live with Zhuo Yi was actually finalized early on.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is to better complete the task of Wang Ling. On the other hand, it is also to stimulate Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>He has figured out the girl's temper quite clearly these days.</p>

    <p>If Zhou Ziyi were a girl, I'm afraid she would have started to get angry by now.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because Zhou Ziyi is a boy and a disabled person that this girl can't say a word now.</p>

    <p>Even if you are a little jealous, you can also sulk on your own.</p>

    <p>To be jealous of a boy. And he's also a disabled person...</p>

    <p>For Jiugong Liangzi, it would be too futile to talk about this matter.</p>

    <p>"I'll cook tonight. Make some home-cooked food."</p>

    <p>After driving for a while, Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel and began to try to break the deadlock in the car.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi knows how to observe words and emotions. He also knows that Jiugong Liangzi is actually unhappy.</p>

    <p>But in this situation, he himself didn't dare to say anything. Just shutting up was the best choice.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi It is impossible for Zhou Ziyi to be embarrassed alone. It is his duty to adjust the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>"Ziyi. Do you have a favorite dish?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"I. I'm not picky about food... just follow my brother and sister-in-law to eat." Zhou Ziyi felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>After he said this, he instinctively wanted to see Jiugong Liangzi's reaction. The strange thing was that the girl in the passenger seat didn't make any movement.</p>

    <p>The girl had clearly tried her best to deny this relationship when she was at his home.</p>

    <p>As a result, for a moment, it felt like a default.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi glanced at her with the corner of her eye and closed her eyes. The girl who seemed to have fallen asleep curled her lips and said, "Your sister-in-law is asleep."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the corners of Jiugong Liangzi's lips twitched obviously.</p>

    <p>"Oh. It turns out that my sister-in-law is asleep..." Zhou Ziyi looked like she suddenly realized something. Her performance was extremely exaggerated.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help but chuckle.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi is smarter than he thought this time.</p>

    <p>He actually guessed that Jiugong Liangzi was pretending to sleep.</p>

    <p>However, he did not expose it directly. Instead, prompted by Zhuo Yi's eyes, he continued to cooperate with the next performance.</p>

    <p>"Just tell me what you want to eat, Ziyi. Anyway, your sister-in-law is asleep. You won't mind." Zhuo Yi said in a lowered voice.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi understood and quickly lowered his voice.</p>

    <p>The scene between the two of them at this time really looked like they were lowering their voices to take care of the sleeping Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>In fact, the sound was not too low. The space in the car was only so big. Jiugong Liangzi could still hear it clearly.</p>

    <p>"What does sister-in-law usually like to eat..."</p>

    <p>"Your sister-in-law is afraid of getting fat. She likes to eat light food. But in fact, she is afraid of eating too light food and not being able to supplement her nutrition."</p>
    
    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Jiugong Liangzi's flat mouse pad and said, "Actually, her favorite dishes are spicy chicken and Maoxuewang."</p>

    <dfn><sup></sup>(Duck's blood, beef and tripe in spicy soup.)</dfn>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi smiled. His eyes were full of envy: "Hey. That's great!"</p>

    <p>"Hasn't Ziyi ever had a girlfriend?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"I'm a disabled person. How can anyone look up to me?" Zhou Ziyi shrugged helplessly: "Those teachers and classmates in school take care of me. At least they do a good job on the surface. But there are always discussions in private. of."</p>

    <p>"What did they say about you?"</p>

    <p>"emm... I was told how a disabled person managed to get into Jian Shen College. It was probably something like that."</p>

    <p>"You're not angry?"</p>

    <p>"This is nothing to be angry about."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi said: "Sometimes many people don't want to listen to your excuses. They just enjoy the pleasure of arguing with you."</p>

    <p>"That makes sense."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was secretly surprised by Zhou Ziyi's maturity: "Your sister-in-law often quarrels with me at home."</p>

    <p>"You two are in different situations. When a couple quarrels at the end of the bed, does it end at the end of the bed? The more arguments there are, the better the relationship is." Zhou Ziyi said.</p>

    <p>When he speaks.</p>

    <p>Always observe Jiugong Liangzi's expression.</p>

    <p>During this brief conversation, he kept calling sister-in-law. The corners of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth and eyes kept twitching as he kept calling sister-in-law...</p>

    <p>Even Zhou Ziyi became curious. How long can Jiugong Liangzi last?</p>

    <p>But yes, you can never wake someone who is pretending to sleep.</p>

    <p>As long as Jiugong Liangzi doesn't want to wake up, I'm afraid it won't matter no matter how "excessive" their next topic is.</p>

    <p>How embarrassing it would be if I woke up and refuted it now...</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi obviously noticed this. He started to suddenly increase the firepower with the accelerator under his feet.</p>

    <p>"Ziyi." At this time, Zhuo Yi suddenly said.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with Brother Zhuo?" Zhou Ziyi understood and asked cooperatively.</p>

    <p>The two immediately started singing and chatting.</p>

    <p>"I was just thinking. If I got married earlier, would my son be about the same age as you?"</p>

    <p>"Pfft." Zhou Ziyi couldn't hold back and laughed out loud on the spot: "Brother Zhuo wants to be my father? Godfather?"</p>

    <p>"Godfather or something. That's too much. I think, I can be your master. Once a master, always a father."</p>

    <p>"Then I will be your son from now on?"</p>

    <p>"If you were my son, then the person next to you now would not be your sister-in-law. We are a standard family of three in this car now."</p>

    <p>"A family of three...I understand!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi bowed on the spot and bowed to Jiugong Liangzi in the passenger seat: "Greetings, mother!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi opened his eyes suddenly, clenched his two small fists tightly together, and shouted: "Who is your mother!"</p>

    <p>She!</p>

    <p>I can't stand it anymore...</p>

    <p>What the hell is this!</p>

  <p>The more you say it, the more outrageous it becomes...</p></div>
