  <h1>Chapter 1896 Wang Nuan takes action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This silver bullet came from outside the sky. It was astonishingly accurate. And it pierced from outside the core world! Before hitting the arrow, it directly made a big hole in the outer wall of the core world!</p>

    <p>Who shot the bullet? It could have such power...</p>

    <p>Even Jingze was shocked. He had never seen such powerful modern cultivation technology.</p>

    <p>In order to effectively ensure that there are no obstacles to the revival of the Dragon Clan, Jingze previously made an assessment of the level of modern human cultivation society in all aspects.</p>

    <p>This is simply not the power of any heavy sniper currently on the planet.</p>

    <p>He couldn't figure out who could shoot such powerful bullets to stop him.</p>

    <p>But judging from the means, this person is obviously not Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe also had an in-depth discussion and exchange with him about Wang Ling's behavior pattern. This person is a person who slaps him whenever he disagrees.</p>

    <p>Long-range sniping like this is obviously not Wang Ling's personal style.</p>

    <p>"This is a bullet fired from eternity."</p>

    <p>In the endless and deep universe, the ethereal voice of Bai Zhe came out from the planet sphere transformed by the huge moonlight dragon body. It was like a grand bell rumbling in the universe. It made Jingze feel in awe.</p>

    <p>"Dragon Lord!"</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry. I'm by your side. This bullet is just a means of delaying time."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe spoke with a strong sense of self-confidence. After all, the opponent was not Wang Ling. He believed that he had a way to deal with this situation.</p>

    <p>With Bai Zhe as his backing, Jingze's confidence was obviously much higher. He took a deep breath and started to draw the bowstring in his hand again.</p>

    <p>The second arrow shot towards Wang Muyu. However, at the same time, the silver bullet from the sky came again accurately. A chirping sound came from a distance. It cut through the void and penetrated the outer wall of the core world. Sharp. And precise.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, Bai Zhe also took action. He instilled moonlight from a distant position, and turned into a bright moon behind Jingze. In an instant, endless icy air surged in, as if he had the magical power to freeze the nine heavens.</p>

    <p>The speed of the silver bullet slowed down significantly under the force of this cold. Wang Muyu saw that this was not a simple freezing. It was a kind of moon ice that could completely freeze time and space.</p>

    <p>This is one of the unique skills of the leader of the dragon clan, Moonlight Dragon. Bai Zhe had not yet shown such an ability in the first encounter. However, now he has become proficient in controlling this power. This deeply shocked Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>He is obviously a usurper who has nothing to do with the Dragon Clan. He is just tied to the identity of the Moonlight Dragon. He can actually understand the Dragon Clan's unique skills to this extent.</p>

    <p>"Boom!" Wang Muyu opened his mouth and spit out glass flames. This was originally a dragon restraint technique to dissolve "Moon God Ice."</p>

    <p>When the Moon God Ice encounters the Glaze Flame, they can clearly feel that the Moon God Ice is evaporating under the heat of the Glaze Flame. However, Wang Muyu is obviously not very proficient in the Glaze Flame. They can feel that he has been working very hard to spit fire. However, Bai Zhe's Moon God Ice is even better. Under the strong freezing power, the restraining effect of the glazed flame is nothing more than a drop in the bucket.</p>

    <p>"Is this the pride of the dragon clan you are talking about? Jingze!" Wang Muyu was very angry. As a dragonborn, he watched helplessly as a person who did not belong to the dragon clan usurped the throne. It made him feel angry.</p>

    <p>He asked loudly with a milky voice. The voice seemed to be emanating from the bones. It had a natural cleanness.</p>

    <p>This made Jingze's eyes change slightly. But he soon returned to his cold look. He stared at Wang Muyu: "As long as the Dragon Clan can be revived, it doesn't matter who is the leader. To me."</p>

    <p>He replied to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"Crack!"</p>

    <p>Everything happened in an instant. Under Bai Zhe's cover, the Moon Ice spread onto the trajectory of the second silver bullet, freezing everything around it and freezing the bullet directly in the void.</p>

    <p>However, the next second, a big explosion occurred in the void. Jingze did not expect that the second bullet actually laid a spell trap. As long as it was stopped by an external force, it would immediately produce a spiritual explosion.</p>

    <p>A huge mushroom cloud rose directly from the core world.</p>

    <p>The strong air waves affected the trajectory of the arrow, causing Jingze's second arrow to miss again. "I knew it would be like this." Xiang Yi sneered from a distance. He was holding the Nine Sun Divine Sword. The look on his face also relaxed a lot.</p>

    <p>His mission has been completed. After all, he is in eternity. A sniper attack that spans countless time and space. The difficulty level is too high.</p>

    <p>It would be better to leave the rest to Nuan Zhenren.</p>

    <p>After the spiritual explosion was generated, Jingze and Bai Zhe waited for a moment. The third bullet that spanned eternity has not yet arrived. Let Bai Zhe know clearly that the number of bullets in this time is limited.</p>

    <p>The third bullet's reinforcements will not arrive anytime soon.</p>

    <p>"It seems that no one will stop us anymore." He sighed. Then he gave Jingze the next step of instructions.</p>

    <p>Now is the best time to capture Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Jingze nodded slightly. He called back the arrow and put his hand on the bowstring again. The only difference was that it was slightly different from before. There seemed to be an additional magic weapon tied to the head of the arrow.</p>

    <p>It was a giant sealed net. It was called Ten Thousand Scales Dragon Net. It was a magic weapon created by Bai Zhe specifically to imprison Wang Muyu. It was shaped by tens of thousands of dragon scales. The moment it was used, it produced endless divine light. Extremely dazzling.</p>

    <p>This net is also a dragon-born magic weapon. It is of light level! In order to capture Wang Muyu, Bai Zhe definitely took great pains.</p>

    <p>This is the final blow. Unless Wang Ling comes in person. Otherwise, Jingze feels that no one can organize all this.</p>

    <p>Blood oozed from the corners of Wang Muyu's mouth. He did not give up. He was releasing the last of his dragon energy to resist. However, there was a Ten Thousand Scales Dragon Net here. No matter what he did, it was all in vain.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>Another arrow!</p>

    <p>And it was an arrow with a Ten Thousand Scales Dragon Net. It was shot directly.</p>

    <p>At the same moment. At an extremely far distance. Spanning countless time. Wang Ling's eyes also peeked at the first scene at the same moment.</p>

    <p>But he didn't take action because he knew very clearly that Jingze's arrow would be blocked.</p>

    <p>There was a "pop" sound. A flash of green flew down from a distance like an aurora. It directly resisted the power of the two dragon-born magic weapons, the arrow and the Ten Thousand Scales Dragon Net. It directly competed with them.</p>

    <p>"Damn it. Why is there another one!" Jingze felt a little impatient. One after another people jumped out to stop him, which made him extremely irritated.</p>

    <p>Then he calmed down and saw clearly what was blocking his two Dragonborn magic weapons.</p>

    <p>He was shocked.</p>

    <p>Because it turned out to be a green grass...</p>

    <p>"This is...Sword Spirit?"</p>

    <p>In a daze, Jingze frowned. He felt that this familiar scene seemed to have been seen before.</p>

    <p>"Eaaah!"</p>

    <p>In the next second, a small body came out of the air. It actually smashed through the outer wall of the core world with its diaper-wrapped butt, forcing its way in here.</p>

    <p>Looking at the baby girl who suddenly broke in.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jingze felt terrified.</p>
