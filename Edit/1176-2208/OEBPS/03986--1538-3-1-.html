  <h1>Chapter 1538 Wang Ling style education</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The originally vast doomsday of chaos was swallowed up by King's Eyes in an instant. Those raging flames of chaos were extinguished in an instant. It was as desolate as a solitary smoke in the desert.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling takes back King's Eyes. It only takes a few seconds of immersion.</p>

    <p>The next moment!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The endless chaos energy, accompanied by the chaotic flames, became more ferocious than before. Super Zheng was swallowed up!</p>

    <p>This is the charged counterattack of King's Eyes. It has the effect of doubling the repayment.</p>

    <p>The longer you hold it in, the greater your strength will be.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dare not hold it in for too long. If he holds it in for a few minutes and repays it with hundreds of times of power... The entire solar system in the world will be annihilated in an instant.</p>

    <p>"This..." In King's Eyes, Peng Xiren saw this amazing scene.</p>

    <p>He had imagined how powerful Wang Ling's King's Eyes would be.</p>

    <p>But the ability to instantly absorb spells and return them twice as much...Peng Xiren has never seen it before.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of me is too terrifying.</p>

    <p>The chaotic flames emitted by King's Eyes were several times more damaging than Zheng's previous explosion. The blazing temperature burned the space on the spot, forming a large black hole.</p>

    <p>The tongues of fire were ferocious. They devoured the ground in front of them, turning everything within sight into scorched earth in an instant.</p>

    <p>A large amount of sea water was evaporated. For a time, the whole world was filled with white mist.</p>

    <p>This move hits the front of Zheng. However, after all, it is the ability to repay the other person's way multiple times.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zheng itself is also extremely powerful.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid this little strength can't hurt him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This move. The first is to intimidate. The second is to force.</p>

    <p>He wanted to push hard. Zheng looked like he was using all his strength.</p>

    <p>After all, he has never fought against people or creatures from the Earthly Ancestor before.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling doesn't know what the upper limit of his current strength is.</p>

    <p>If he can beat Zheng, his own strength should be above that of Earthly Ancestor, right?</p>

    <p>Who knows...</p>

    <p>In the white mist, Zheng's figure appeared again. He looked taller than before. His height soared to more than three meters. He was the same as those ancient magic soldiers.</p>

    <p>Although the huge figure looks scary, it does not give Wang Ling a sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>The only difference is that he has a jet black armor with Heavenly Dao runes engraved on it.</p>

    <p>"It's Chaos Armor." Jin Deng frowned.</p>

    <p>He has had several battle experiences with Zheng. He is well aware of some of Zheng's methods.</p>

    <p>Chaos Armor is something that Zheng has extracted from Chaos since he was born. It can be regarded as a gift given to him by Chaos. Including the Chaos Gun in his hand, it is also a thing of Chaos.</p>

    <p>Chaos objects are one order of magnitude stronger than their counterparts of boundary-level magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Now two chaos objects are in the hands of Zheng, making his combat power actually stronger than that of the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>Chaos Armor has been strengthened to a terrifying level under Zheng's constant sacrifice for so many years.</p>

    <p>It allows Zheng to travel smoothly in chaos. And it is immune to all damage from chaos...</p>

    <p>In other words, the attack of King's Eyes that doubled the damage just now has failed.</p>

    <p>Zheng emerged from the fog.</p>

    <p>At this time, the way he looked at Wang Ling had obviously changed.</p>

    <p>Then he glanced at the monk Jin Deng who was standing next to him. He couldn't help but twitching his lips: "Master, how come you are weaker than your apprentice?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng wanted to retort.</p>

    <p>But after thinking about it, I feel like there is nothing wrong with what he said...except for the problem with the master-disciple relationship. He is indeed weaker than Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>However, he could hear such a sentence from Zheng's mouth. Jin Deng felt that this was Zheng's recognition of Wang Ling's opponent.</p>

    <p>But it is obvious that Zheng has not yet understood the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>Because Ling Zhenren is Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>No one ever needs to recognize him.</p>

    <p>The next second. Zheng transformed the rune spear in his hand into a pair of fists that firmly covered his arms.</p>

    <p>He no longer uses long-range spells for testing. He directly switches to close combat.</p>

    <p>Ta!</p>

    <p>A simple but violent blow. It hit Wang Ling's right arm on the spot. The blow did not cause much pain. It just caused an itching feeling.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, after Xie's blow, Wang Ling read, a series of painful sounds sounded in Xie's heart.</p>

    <p>Damn! It hurts! It hurts, it hurts...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>But Zheng still endured it and did not show it directly.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Wang Ling still did not take action. He only took a defensive posture. The figures of the two sides intertwined. The battle looked particularly fierce. In a short period of time, he and Wang Ling exchanged hundreds of blows.</p>

    <p>"No one has ever fought like this with the sword master..."</p>

    <p>Next to him, Jingke's eyes moved.</p>

    <p>Although he is watching, he is also learning.</p>

    <p>As the number one sword spirit under Wang Ling. The master of the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jingke's potential has not been reached to its maximum.</p>

    <p>The monk looked at Jingke's serious face. He was also horrified...</p>

    <p>The master and the servant are indeed monsters.</p>

    <p>You can grow just by looking...</p>

    <p>It's like the comforting thought of many scum who don't listen well in class: what the teacher says is in the book anyway. So since it's in the book. Just go home and read the book. It doesn't matter if you go to class or not. It's okay to feel the water...</p>

    <p>However, it turns out that there are some things that cannot be seen just by looking at them.</p>

    <p>People who can understand by watching.</p>

    <p>Like Jingke. They're all demons.</p>

    <p>Zheng's movement, martial arts and fighting skills are all very skilled and advanced.</p>

    <p>These experiences accumulated from eternity are too numerous to imagine.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng didn't understand why Wang Ling didn't take action at first. Instead, he took a defensive posture.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, he saw Jingke studying next to him.</p>

    <p>It dawned on me in an instant.</p>

    <p>It turns out Wang Ling. was intentional!</p>

    <p>He deliberately let go of the fight with Zheng. This gave Jingke the opportunity to learn on the side!</p>

    <p>I can watch it for a while just by looking at it...it's outrageous!</p>

    <p>However, in the duel between masters, they all feel each other.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so obviously perfunctory. It made Zheng angry.</p>

    <p>"You only know how to defend? Aren't you very good at fighting? Come! Fight with me!" he shouted. He used his fists to quickly attack with magical weapons. In just one second, his fists were like flying. He could hit up to Thousands of punches.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling blocked it carelessly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I was also observing Jingke's learning progress.</p>

    <p>The little guys and students are very fast.</p>

    <p>This is his sword spirit. So he knows it best.</p>

    <p>After about two minutes of fighting with Zheng.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that Jingke's study time is almost up.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>A punch without any magic modification. It is also the frontal attack that Zheng has been waiting for.</p>

    <p>"Yes! That's it! Come on! Let me see how powerful your punch is..."</p>

    <p>The word "strong" didn't escape his lips. Under Zheng's ecstatic eyes, the punch hit him directly in the abdomen.</p>

    <p>This is a punch that Zheng cannot stop with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>He can punch tens of thousands of punches in one second. His punch speed is extremely fast! I don't know how many times stronger than those female punches!</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's punch speed is even more powerful than his!</p>

    <p>The naked eye couldn't react in time. A punch was already aimed at the abdomen.</p>

    <p>What followed was severe pain in the abdomen and vomiting of blood!</p>

    <p>"Cough!" Purple blood spurted out from Zheng's mouth. It was a big mouthful. The blood dripped on the ground and immediately incinerated a pit millions of miles deep.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect Zheng's blood to have such powerful energy.</p>

    <p>Now he realized why the monk asked him to be merciful. If he didn't take action, he would kill Zheng.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, this is due to old feelings.</p>

    <p>And to organize further destruction of the planet.</p>

    <p>Should Xie die.</p>

    <p>He'll blow himself up.</p>

    <p>And the force of that explosion could be devastating to half the universe.</p>

    <p>Just a mouthful of blood can have such terrifying destructive power. If Zheng was punched by him and exploded like a watermelon, then Wang Ling would be tantamount to detonating a huge cosmic-level nuclear bomb.</p>

    <p>"Clang!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, a trembling sound came.</p>

    <p>Zheng took out a magical weapon that emitted purple fluorescence.</p>

    <p>It was an ancient picture. It looked like it was from eternity. It had terrifying pressure.</p>

    <p>Is it another chaos device...</p>

    <p>The sense of oppression from the Chaos Device is very strong.</p>

    <p>It is the scariest of all the magic weapons Wang Ling has seen so far.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how many times it is stronger than those anti-realm magic weapons.</p>

    <p>"Go!" The Swordman shouted. The ancient map has already flown up. It's wrapped around Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Supreme Corpse Map..." The monk recognized the origin of this magical weapon.</p>

    <p>This is a chaos device owned by Dao Ancestor Wang back then.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that this chaos device would actually appear in the hands of Zheng.</p>

    <p>Supreme Corpse Map!</p>

    <p>Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang used this magical weapon to suppress countless powerful enemies! And every successful suppression would increase the power of the Corpse Map!</p>

    <p>This is a magic weapon with no upper limit.</p>

    <p>Ridiculously strong!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is very strong.</p>

    <p>And Zheng also noticed this and sacrificed this magical weapon.</p>

    <p>If we can successfully suppress Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This Corpse Map must not be instantly strengthened to an unknown number of levels...</p>

    <p>"You can't escape."</p>

    <p>Zheng After using the Corpse Map, he put on an attitude of watching a show: "There were many eternal strong men who were suppressed by this Corpse Map back then. They were all outstanding in strength. In the end, they were all defeated. It's in the hands of Corpse Map. And Corpse Map's current strength cannot be measured numerically..."</p>

    <p>His face looked extremely confident.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, be careful! Don't get entangled in pictures!" Even the monk became nervous.</p>

    <p>In the history of the Chaos Device, the status of the Supreme Corpse Map is self-evident. Although the monk unswervingly believes in the strength of Wang Ling... But at this time, he saw Zheng sacrifice This Supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>He couldn't resist a word of caution.</p>

    <p>Because in the long course of history.</p>

    <p>He saw too much. For underestimating the Shroud of the Supreme. The masters who were eventually suppressed.</p>

    <p>How could those masters not raise their arms and make the sun and moon eclipse?</p>

    <p>However, they all lost in the hands of this supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Just like the name of this magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Was suppressed.</p>

    <p>And then smelted...</p>

    <p>It became a corpse left in eternity.</p>

    <p>At this time, when the Supreme Corpse Map was opened, the long map stretching for thousands of miles was filled with an endless and terrifying atmosphere of blood and chaos.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, Wang Ling's pupils shrank slightly.</p>

    <p>On the thousands-mile-long scroll in front of you, there appeared countless bones. They were densely piled on top of the Corpse Map...</p>

    <p>These are the powerful men who were once suppressed by the Supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>They were trapped in the scroll. Eventually, they were drained of all their strength and died.</p>

    <p>Some of these bones are in a sitting position, indicating weakness.</p>

    <p>You are standing in a standing posture, which indicates a kind of helplessness.</p>

    <p>There were also bones, clawing at the edge of the scroll, as if they were about to crawl out of the scroll at the next moment... They tried to break through the Corpse Map, but failed. It foreshadowed a kind of despair...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually never thought of it.</p>

    <p>There are actually such anti-human magical weapons in this universe.</p>

    <p>But the so-called chaos weapons are not man-made. They are bred and refined from chaos.</p>

    <p>Because the quantity is limited, it is precious because of its amazing power.</p>

    <p>Each chaos weapon has its own independent wisdom. It mainly depends on whether you have the ability to conquer them...</p>

    <p>When Dao Ancestor Wang obtained this Corpse Map, the Corpse Map was not very powerful.</p>

    <p>And now eons have passed.</p>

    <p>Devoured and drained so many strong men.</p>

    <p>The Corpse Map has obviously been matched. The word "Supreme" in front of it.</p>

    <p>Forcibly suppress Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then use the power of the Corpse Map to release Peng Xiren who was sealed in the King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>This is Zheng's next planning strategy.</p>

    <p>"You can force me to sacrifice the Corpse Map. Wang Ling...your strength. I recognize it." Zheng spoke.</p>

    <p>The long scroll of thousands of miles was like a swimming dragon under his control. It surrounded Wang Ling from all directions.</p>

    <p>"Take it!" The next second. Zheng's palm grabbed hard. The Wanli scroll suddenly pulled inward.</p>

    <p>But at this moment.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a brown sword light soaring into the sky, the heaven and earth shook. They boiled again!</p>

    <p>"Um?"</p>

    <p>The mahogany sword that was originally injured by his battle cry, took action again. This was something Xie didn't expect.</p>

    <p>"Out of your depth!" He laughed coldly. He manipulated the corpse map and rolled it towards Jingke at the same time.</p>

    <p>This is a chaos weapon that has grown up over the ages. Especially one that can be shaken by a little sword spirit that has just been born?</p>

    <p>But the next moment.</p>

    <p>The brown sword light in the air suddenly exploded!</p>

    <p>Thousands of meteors fell from the sky, like a sudden explosion of fireworks.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the explosion caused the Corpse Map to collapse on the spot!</p>

    <p>The thousand-mile scroll was cut into pieces and turned into countless scraps of paper scattered in the sky!</p>

    <p>"you..."</p>

    <p>A sudden scene that shocked Zheng.</p>

    <p>He could clearly feel that the aura of this little sword spirit was different from before.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, he actually became stronger than before?</p>

    <p>What is this...</p>

    <p>"Destroy my Corpse Map! You are looking for death!" Zheng yelled. He rushed forward to fight with Jingke. Jingke saw the path of the punch clearly and easily dodged it by turning sideways.</p>

    <p>This movement looks familiar in Zheng.</p>

    <p>Because this is his own body style!</p>

    <p>And now. Zheng finally understands why Wang Ling didn't fight him properly before!</p>

    <p>It turns out that all this is to provide his sword spirit with an online teaching opportunity...</p>

    <p>The spirit of Dharma under his majestic Dao Ancestor Wang could actually be taken advantage of by a young man!</p>

    <p>This made Zheng feel like he was vomiting blood.</p>

    <p>This feeling is just like the psychotic female artist yesterday who charged 2,900 yuan for painting, painted a work worth 500 yuan, and then publicly said that she was bullied. Ku Xuan was so angry that he almost had a cerebral hemorrhage!</p>

    <p>Supreme Corpse Map. This was something given to him by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Zheng has been using it carefully.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that today, the Corpse Map would be directly cut into pieces...</p>

    <p>"I'll fight you!"</p>

    <p>Zheng went crazy. He rushed forward desperately.</p>

    <p>Jingke was also a little angry.</p>

    <p>The appearance of Zheng before made him lose face in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But this place. He has found it now.</p>

    <p>But these alone are obviously not enough.</p>

    <p>"Sheath - come -" This time, it was Jingke who said it himself.</p>

    <p>Under the extremely calm words, a mahogany sword scabbard suddenly appeared in the other world.</p>

    <p>Critical moment. Bai Qiao sacrifices himself.</p>

    <p>It's not that Jingke thinks he can't beat him now.</p>

    <p>But I feel that when facing the spirit of Dharma under Dao Ancestor Wang, he should respect his complete body!</p>

    <p>It's not just because we want to get together. That's why we made such an excuse.</p>

    <p>And when Bai Qiao appeared, Zheng also had a look of disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>There was only one question mark in his mind.</p>

    <p>That's why this scabbard has spirit...</p>

    <p>The scabbard and sword body should originally be inseparable.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to have both a sword spirit and a sheath spirit.</p>

    <p>But the scene in front of him was obviously beyond Zheng's understanding once again.</p>

    <p>He charged towards Jingke regardless.</p>

    <p>After a snow-white light flashed in front of his eyes, a young man slightly larger than Jingke appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>The young man was wearing a white fur coat with flying snowy hair. The protruding hair on the top of his head was particularly dazzling.</p>

    <p>With a condescending look and an arrogant attitude, he grabbed Zheng's fist on the spot and squeezed his flesh fist firmly in his palm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw this scene. He already knew it in his heart. There is no suspense in the next battle.</p>

    <p>Don't say you want to kill this Zheng.</p>

    <p>Next, I'm afraid even Jingbai's defense won't be able to break through.</p>

    <p>Heavy white snow began to fall in the other world.</p>

    <p>There is chaos in the snow.</p>

    <p>Zheng has always been sensitive to chaos. Some people have sensed it.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" From the chaotic snow, Zheng felt that the sword spirit regenerated after merging in front of him had an unusual origin.</p>

    <p>He frowned and stared at the shocked white man.</p>

    <p>"You are not qualified to know..." Jingbai retorted.</p>

    <p>He stood with his hands behind his hands. His face was as white as jade. When he spoke, he had a feeling of vastness.</p>

    <p>"No one has ever spoken to me like this. You are too confident." Zheng snorted. When he defeated the invincible opponent in the world, he was probably shocked before he was born.</p>

    <p>In fact, I can't figure it out why Jingbai had the courage to talk to him.</p>

    <p>However, at the next moment, Jingbai looked at him with an indifferent expression: "It's all over."</p>

    <p>Under the dull voice, a sword light mixed with brown and white colors emerged from the white fingertips with a power that divided the world!</p>

    <p>The strong sword intent stretched for hundreds of millions of miles and affected the entire solar system. All the planets contracted and trembled after receiving the inspiration.</p>

    <p>Although this battle is in another world, this kind of fluctuation is so strong that it can penetrate!</p>

    <p>Everyone inside and outside the world suddenly felt shuddering!</p>

    <p>At that time, all those people on the earth were trembling for no reason. The fundamental reason behind it was Jingbai's sword energy that penetrated the inner and outer worlds!</p>

    <p>This sword light towers over the sky and the earth. It stretches for countless thousands of miles. It is boundless.</p>

    <p>Zheng just can't figure it out.</p>

    <p>Why does a sword spirit have such terrifying power!</p>

    <p>The earth began to divide. The earth spirit in the inner world let out a painful howl. It was like a kitchen knife was inserted into the belly of the earth. Then it slowly split forward.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Then, white lightning appeared in the void again. The madness was boundless.</p>

    <p>The sound was louder than anyone imagined. Countless snow-colored thunder dragons were roaring. The sound seemed to come from eternity. It was terrifying to hear.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>Zheng's expression finally changed. He looked shocked and said, "You...are you from eternity?"</p>

    <p>He has seen all the powerful men throughout the ages, but he never remembered such a number one figure...</p>

    <p>"You are thinking too much."</p>

    <p>His face turned pale with shock, and his face remained unruffled. He just hummed.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! You are definitely an eternal person! And your master! How can you be only sixteen years old!" Zheng felt more and more. The Wang Ling in front of him was shocked and had an unusual origin.</p>

    <p>"Are you trying to excuse your failure? I have seen a lot of losers. I thought you were different. But I didn't expect that you are no different from those losers. You know you are going to lose, so you just make excuses."</p>

    <p>Jingbai frowned slightly: "You haven't thought about it. Do we just look older?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words left Zheng speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Even if you look older... you can't be as old as eternity!</p>

    <p>The two people in front of me are obviously of eternal strength...</p>

    <p>However, many of those eternal strong men have been suppressed in the Supreme Corpse Map just now!</p>

    <p>"Leave it alone. You are not worthy of standing in the same void as this king."</p>

    <p>The next second. Accompanied by shocked words, the terrifying sword energy that penetrated the world suddenly "buzzed!" It suddenly attacked and cut towards Zheng's body!</p>

    <p>The pitch-black Chaos Armor suffered a huge earthquake. The shock caused Zheng to vomit blood again.</p>

    <p>This sword energy is too strong!</p>

    <p>Even with the obstruction of Chaos Armor, the sword energy still split apart like electricity and rushed into his body!</p>

    <p>As a result, Zheng felt like he was being hit by strong electricity all over his body.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The blood energy rolled. The chaotic armor was torn apart on the spot by the frightening brown-white sword energy. The broken armor. Countless fragments ended up with the chaotic light. Finally, they gradually dissipated under the naked eye and became particles of dust in the universe...</p>

    <p>Zheng failed.</p>

    <p>It was a complete defeat.</p>

    <p>And he knows it very well.</p>

    <p>I still have to hold on to the sword energy just now.</p>

    <p>The little sword spirit after the merger. The young man standing in front of him now was shocked.</p>

    <p>Its combat power is above that of Earthly Ancestor!</p>

    <p>"you..."</p>

    <p>Zheng had blood oozing from the corners of his mouth. He stood up from the ground with difficulty: "Why on earth? You have to go against me to this point..."</p>

    <p>Jingbai tilted his neck and looked at him: "My sword master has something. It's in Peng Xiren's hand."</p>

    <p>"What?" Zheng gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p>He knows.</p>

    <p>At this point, Zheng feels that we can only negotiate.</p>

    <p>His mission is to protect Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>If you can give me something, save this person. Zheng thinks this is a good deal.</p>

    <p>"A black stone. Its radiation has the effect of limiting power." Jingbai spoke. Instead of Wang Ling, he said what Wang Ling wanted to say.</p>

    <p>"Immaterial Stone?"</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned. He breathed hard: "What you said should be the treasure left by my master Dao Ancestor Wang. The stone that was bred from chaos."</p>

    <p>"It seems. You know."</p>

    <p>"That's my master's thing. Of course I know..."</p>

    <p>Zheng said: "As long as we have this, we can let him go, right?"</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling took a step forward and spoke proactively: "Yes."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is actually not too critical. What Wang Ling really wants is the stone.</p>

    <p>After all, Peng Xiren is such a good person.</p>

    <p>You can capture it whenever you want.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that Zheng would put forward any other conditions.</p>

    <p>And that's when it happened. I saw a relieved look on my opponent's face. Begin to show a look of want to cry without tears. Directly began to scold: "Fuck! Just wanted a stone! If I had known you wanted this stone, I wouldn't have fought!"</p>

    <p>He was really distressed.</p>

    <p>In order to rescue Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Taken together with the Supreme Corpse Map and his Chaos Armor. Two pieces of chaos equipment...</p>

    <p>The loss is too great!</p>
