  <h1>Chapter 1534 Suppressing the Ancient Divine Weapons</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was just a moment. Everyone in the Devouring Star was sweating profusely. Their bodies were cold and their skulls were trembling.</p>

    <p>There is an extremely ominous premonition forming in everyone's mind.</p>

    <p>Through the evil pupil, Fenmu Shen projected the scene he saw into the boundless darkness of the Devouring Star. That was exactly where Peng Xiren and Wang Ling were in the inner world.</p>

    <p>Although the battle situation has not yet been finally decided.</p>

    <p>But Fenmu Shen seems to have seen the ending.</p>

    <p>"Xiren is going to lose... I knew it. This is a trap. This person is not that easy to deal with. Sure enough, his weak aura is all fake." Fenmu Shen said with a trembling voice.</p>

    <p>No further explanation is needed. Next to them were Akano Sekitora, the Silverskin King, Jiugong Xinghui and a group of Silverskin aliens. Everyone's hearts sank at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Senior. What should we do."</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>This situation seems a bit embarrassing.</p>

    <p>Because no one among them dared to go out. Even if they had the courage to go out, they would not be able to join the battle below.</p>

    <p>Even if they join the battle, they are just cannon fodder.</p>

    <p>Even the simplest way of delaying the battle doesn't exist. It's like going out and giving him a headshot.</p>

    <p>However, under the current situation, they know that Peng Xiren's importance to them is self-evident.</p>

    <p>At this critical moment, we must not let anything happen to Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>The tomb has not been opened yet...</p>

    <p>As for the location of the celestial tomb, only Peng Xiren currently knows it.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen is still waiting for the opening of the tomb to merge with the other half of his soul that he has been separated from for many years.</p>

    <p>If Peng Xiren dies in the hands of Wang Ling at this time, everything will be over.</p>

    <p>His evil eyes stared at that world.</p>

    <p>His sight passed through the layers of space. He was staring at the scene of Wang Ling's confrontation with Peng Xiren from a God's perspective.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's ears moved slightly. It seemed that he was aware of it.</p>

    <p>A pair of red eyes looked directly back.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was so frightened that she quickly withdrew her gaze.</p>

    <p>This boy is so scary...</p>

    <p>Incredibly sharp and unimaginable.</p>

    <p>"There is no other way. In this situation, I can only try my best to rescue." Fenmu Shen suppressed the panic on his face and said with a frown.</p>

    <p>"Senior, what do you want to do?" The expression on Akano Sekitora's face twitched, and his whole body was trembling uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>He shivered every time he thought about the moment when his head was pinched by the boy's clone.</p>

    <p>"In this case, I can't go out directly. You can't count on it... Therefore, there is only one way I can think of." Fenmu Shen said.</p>

    <p>In the realm of Akano Sekitora and the Silverskin King, the past is to die.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen knows this very well.</p>

    <p>However, although the two of them are weak, they will be of great use in the future.</p>

    <p>Now is not the time to sacrifice them.</p>

    <p>Being able to live for such a long time in the history of cultivation was even regarded as a monster by Dao Ancestor Wang back then. It is impossible for Fenmu Shen not to have something of his own.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, Fenmu Shen even planned several wars against the entire universe.</p>

    <p>He tried to conquer ten universes to build his ultimate universe empire of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But such plans were repeatedly discovered and shattered by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>The legions that were prepared back then were all destroyed by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>However, after Fenmu Shen's soul was divided and sealed, Dao Ancestor Wang believed that he was no longer a threat and did not investigate further.</p>

    <p>And it is precisely this that now leaves Fenmu Shen with some room for improvement...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen closed his eyes and communicated with the things he had prepared to conquer the universe.</p>

    <p>"Hydrogen slave..."</p>

    <p>"Helium slave..."</p>

    <p>"Lithium slave..."</p>

    <p>"Beryllium slave..."</p>

    <p>In his heart, he called these familiar names one by one.</p>

    <p>Not long after, there were several vague figures on the distant battlefield, surrounded by chaotic energy. They were suddenly transported from the distant universe to the inner world where Wang Ling and Peng Xiren were.</p>

    <p>They have no faces. Their whole bodies show an obsidian-like luster. They are puppets made of special materials.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen calls them "slaves."</p>

    <p>But in fact, it was the most important part of Fenmu Shen's space journey plan.</p>

    <p>Also known as: Ancient Divine Weapon!</p>

    <p>It's a pity that now, the amount he has hoarded is not much.</p>

    <p>There were hundreds of millions of ancient divine weapons back then. Now there are only a few hundred or so left.</p>

    <p>The ones summoned right now are all the ones closest to the earth.</p>

    <p>But if it is used to rescue Peng Xiren, Fenmu Shen thinks it should be enough to delay it for a while.</p>

    <p>The arrival of the four nearest ancient divine soldiers was like a meteorite falling. In an instant, a huge earthquake wave occurred in the inner world. All the buildings on Sun Island were destroyed in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>A tsunami tens of meters high swept over, creating a scene that looked like the end of the world.</p>

    <p>The dark humanoid ancient divine weapon is three meters tall. Standing in front of human cultivators, it looks like a giant.</p>

    <p>The diamond-shaped suspended head has a high-tech feel. It is hard to imagine that this was something created tens of thousands of years ago.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren and Wang Ling's pupils contracted at the same time.</p>

    <p>None of them expected that four ancient divine weapons would land here.</p>

    <p>And this is also the first time Wang Ling has seen this strange, puppet-like life form.</p>

    <p>The four ancient divine weapons caused huge waves when they landed. Peng Xiren thought he had found an opportunity and wanted to escape from this world.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling grabbed him by the collar and was held in his hand like a little chicken.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly pulled out Peng Xiren's soul and absorbed it with his own palm.</p>

    <p>Then he put the soul of Matsushita Singha into his original body and sent him out of the other world.</p>

    <p>This series of movements is very smooth and natural, just like changing a sim card or a mobile phone circuit board.</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren's soul was held in Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. He felt that all the strength in his body was gone.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know what Wang Ling did.</p>

    <p>I just feel that all the strength in my body is passing away little by little...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the four ancient divine weapons transferred by Fenmu Shen in front of him have become his only hope.</p>

    <p>They fell here like comets hitting the earth, destroying everything on the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Fortunately. This is in another world. Otherwise, I don't know how many innocent people would die because of this unnecessary disaster.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, the war broke out.</p>

    <p>The four ancient divine soldiers formed a formation and charged towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When they attacked, golden light erupted. The obsidian-like metal body exuded a bright luster like gold. Like cannonballs, it emitted a spiritual light that reached the sky.</p>

    <p>Spiritual energy is like the sea. It floods over like a big river.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>The combat power of these ancient divine weapons is actually stronger than that of the Old God in the God Realm.</p>

    <p>It actually has the level of Dao God.</p>

    <p>Need to know.</p>

    <p>These things are just puppets.</p>

    <p>So what kind of state must the masters who created these puppets be in?</p>

    <p>The atmosphere seemed to become tense all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>He stared at Peng Xiren. He tried to get some words out of Peng Xiren's mouth.</p>

    <p>As a result, Peng Xiren twisted his neck and just snorted at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>That's all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave up asking and directly took Peng Xiren's soul into King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Now, his mission is to deal with the four ancient divine weapons in front of him as soon as possible!</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling vaguely felt that the other world had reached a critical point of collapse due to the sudden arrival of the ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Four ancient divine weapons attacked from four directions. The fists like mountains hit various parts of Wang Ling's body. There was an explosion like glass breaking.</p>

    <p>"It's really scary..." Fenmu Shen observed the battle from the perspective of one of the ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>The four ancient divine soldiers just attacked together. Although the attack was extremely precise, it was an attack aimed at the vital point.</p>

    <p>But it didn't hurt Wang Ling at all.</p>

    <p>Instead, their bodies suffered backlash and shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>"Is this still a human? This guy is only sixteen years old!" Akano Sekitora looked ugly. He had always thought Wang Ling was an old monster that had lived for eternity. But after waking up, he learned from Fenmu Shen. Wang Ling is true that he is only 16 years old.</p>

    <p>Everyone is feeling bad.</p>

    <p>How can a 16-year-old be so invincible...to this point?</p>

    <p>It's not the reincarnation of Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>None of this seems to make sense!</p>

    <p>"This person, senior, must not let him go!" Akano Sekitora's thoughts were confused. He felt that Wang Ling had become a nightmare in his mind.</p>

    <p>Unless Wang Ling dies, he will live an unstable life for the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>"I know this better than you." Fenmu Shen's evil eyes are profound.</p>

    <p>He is arranging his troops. He is trying to use the ancient divine weapons to consume Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These four ancient divine soldiers are just the vanguard. Behind them, there are ancient divine soldiers in the distance who will arrive on the battlefield one after another.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After these four ancient divine soldiers received the physical backlash from Wang Ling, their bodies were shattered.</p>

    <p>Those cracks were quickly repaired while being visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"Is the backlash ineffective?" Wang Ling looked at this scene and raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, these strange puppet life forms were not as simple as he imagined.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling does not intend to do it himself.</p>

    <p>Considering that I have to participate in the high school competition later, if I try to mess around with these ancient magic weapons here, the disposable Talisman on my body will be used up quickly.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling sat on the ground, leaning against the wall in the ruins behind him.</p>

    <p>Put one hand on your knee and assume a natural posture as if you were watching a show.</p>

    <p>"Here comes the sword."</p>

    <p>He called softly. A brown wooden sword suddenly appeared in the other world.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. Want me. What to do?"</p>

    <p>Jingke did not manifest a human form. Instead, he appeared in front of Wang Ling in a sword-shaped posture.</p>

    <p>"Clear the place."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gently stroked his sword blade and ordered.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>These two simple words immediately put tremendous pressure on Fenmu Shen, who was secretly observing from a distance.</p>

    <p>This was not the first time he saw Jingke. He felt that this mahogany sword looked familiar...but he couldn't figure out the origin of Jingke.</p>

    <p>After receiving the command from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Jingke's brown aura suddenly bloomed.</p>

    <p>"Do you also want to dance..."</p>

    <p>The four ancient divine weapons were originally floating in the air.</p>

    <p>The overwhelming brown aura is accompanied by the most powerful sword energy.</p>

    <p>Knock them all down from the air with an overwhelming force!</p>

    <p>The sword pressed against the sky, creating a kind of gravity that left no room for these ancient divine soldiers to be condescending.</p>

    <p>At this critical moment, Wang Ling was quite touched by Jingke's failure to waterproof.</p>

    <p>Several times, this little guy deliberately pretended to be weak and wanted to merge with Bai Qiao...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling should just turn a blind eye to these things.</p>

    <p>Fortunately today, judging from Jingke's performance, he obviously has no intention of letting go.</p>

    <p>Therefore. The moment Jingke receives the Wang Ling command.</p>

    <p>He immediately gave these four ancient divine soldiers a show of strength. However, this was not the end yet.</p>

    <p>The power of the King of Sword Spirits is incalculable.</p>

    <p>"Zheng!"</p>

    <p>The huge brown sword energy, hundreds of thousands of miles long, turned into four rays of light that shot into the sky. It struck the surroundings like a laser cannon.</p>

    <p>Because there are no outsiders in the inner world, Jingke has huge room for free expression.</p>

    <p>A seemingly indiscriminate sword attack.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is a charge aimed at vital points.</p>

    <p>The brown sword light struck the heads of the four ancient divine soldiers, hitting them in the middle of the face.</p>

    <p>The ancient divine soldier who suffered a head injury seemed to have lost his mobility. He collapsed on the spot and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>However, the attack has just begun.</p>

    <p>Jingke has so much combat experience. He has never held anything back.</p>

    <p>The moment these four ancient divine soldiers fell, an ocean-like brown sword energy came overwhelmingly, dividing the four ancient divine soldiers.</p>

    <p>"So decisive." Fenmu Shen frowned.</p>

    <p>This mahogany sword is too terrifying. The attack is decisive. Even after it has hit the head, it is still executing the last strike at its own pace, dividing the four ancient divine soldiers on the ground.</p>

    <p>It's just the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>His four ancient divine weapons had been cut into countless tiny pieces, like grains of sand. They were rolled into the air along with the wildly dancing sword waves.</p>

    <p>"This...can this be restored?" Akano Sekitora's pupils were shocked. He was shocked.</p>

    <p>He has never seen such finely divided corpses...</p>

    <p>It can actually be cut into the size of a grain of sand.</p>

    <p>It's simply devastating.</p>

    <p>Although Fenmu Shen was equally surprised by this scene, in the end he just sneered: "It's not over yet."</p>

    <p>The next moment, these ancient divine weapons that were divided into pieces as big as grains of sand erupted into bright golden light again. Their psychic energy soared into the sky, sweeping across the sky and the earth.</p>

    <p>Although there are only a few of these ancient divine weapons left, each one was built with Fenmu Shen's utmost effort. All physical attacks are ineffective against the ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>It also contains sword energy.</p>

    <p>Not to mention dividing it into grains of sand.</p>

    <p>Even if only the iron sheet is invisible to the naked eye, as long as there is a cell structure, the ancient magic weapon can be restored.</p>

    <p>This is the terrifying thing about the ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>Their power comes from chaos.</p>

    <p>And chaos... means infinity.</p>

    <p>Looking at the ancient divine weapons that had reunited, Jingke frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>This was his first time dealing with such a monster. He had no experience at all.</p>

    <p>But I didn't feel afraid at all.</p>

    <p>These are lives formed by extracting a special substance from chaos.</p>

    <p>Theoretically, it is a product of chaos.</p>

    <p>The sword spirit is also bred from chaos.</p>

    <p>These days, who doesn't have something to do with chaos?</p>

    <p>They are all produced under chaos. Of course there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>He has been with Wang Ling for many years. He has studied for so long.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the things he knows are not just those fighting skills.</p>

    <p>Since the sword energy is ineffective.</p>

    <p>Jingke seems to have other ideas.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the blade of his mahogany sword chirped softly and burst into even more blazing light!</p>

    <p>Two runes were born from the body of the mahogany sword!</p>

    <p>"Sword talisman?" Fenmu Shen smiled: "The sword energy has failed. Do you think the talisman is useful?"</p>

    <p>Although the immunity rate of ancient divine weapons to spells is not all, it is still as high as 90%.</p>

    <p>There are not many talismans in this world that can be used to suppress ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>However, at the next moment, the two sword talismans that were born from Jingke's body rushed into the air and opened a dragnet to cover all four ancient divine soldiers.</p>

    <p>Just in an instant. The auras of the four ancient divine soldiers weakened instantly!</p>

    <p>They were entangled in the net and unable to move.</p>

    <p>"What..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was shocked beyond words.</p>

    <p>And when he saw the words on the sword talisman clearly, the shock in his heart was beyond words.</p>

    <p>It's not a very difficult text to understand.</p>

    <p>It says, Odd changes to even. Look at the quadrant for the symbols...</p>
