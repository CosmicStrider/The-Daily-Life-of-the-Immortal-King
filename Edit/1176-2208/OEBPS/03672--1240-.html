  <h1>Chapter 1240 Bald Storm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The successful development of the virtual spirit detection reagent finally gave everyone at the Office of Strategic Deception a glimmer of new hope.</p>

    <p>The war between them and the virtual spirits has begun.</p>

    <p>It's just different from previous battles. The early stage of this battle is a war without smoke.</p>

    <p>The goal of Zhuo Yi is also very clear.</p>

    <p>One: They must find out who Xu Ling is looking for.</p>

    <p>Two: They must rush to find the key figures before the Void Spirit officially launches the Void Invasion, and strangle them in the cradle.</p>

    <p>"Reagents. Let me take them back." At this time, Mr. Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>The Huaguo Shuilian Group has many stores. It allows the reagents developed by Immortal Toya to be quickly produced in large quantities in a short period of time and transported to its stores across the country.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan has already thought about it. He can turn all stores under his industrial chain into invisible virtual spiritual monitoring points.</p>

    <p>Use spell fusion detection reagents to implement large-area artificial rainfall. This is the next best option.</p>

    <p>Because there may be a risk of alerting the enemy.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan put on the wig again and adjusted his clothes.</p>

    <p>He has never made public his baldness. But this time the situation is special.</p>

    <p>Since the Office of Strategic Deception has confirmed that it is an ally, it will disclose it to the ally. This is actually a sign of trust.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll leave this matter to Mr. Sun." Zhuo Yi, Immortal Toya from Zhenyuan all clasped their fists and bowed.</p>

    <p>"Together with each other."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan looked serious. He cupped his fists and responded with four words.</p>

    <p>Then Mr. Boss Sun hurriedly left with Immortal Toya. As a developer of reagents, Immortal Toya had been specially hired by Sun Yiyuan as the chief engineer.</p>

    <p>Research and development of reagents and drugs is also front-line work.</p>

    <p>Contrast Immortal Toya is proud of.</p>

    <p>Doctors are benevolent. Alchemists are also medical workers. Immortal Toya takes it upon himself to fulfill his responsibilities.</p>

    <p>So in the early morning of November 26th.</p>

    <p>With the full cooperation of the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shuilian Group, the ins and outs of the entire matter have been basically figured out.</p>

    <p>Although there are still many doubts about the incident itself, the general direction has been set.</p>

    <p>In just a few hours, Immortal Toya quickly developed a reagent for detecting virtual spirits.</p>

    <p>This speed is jaw-dropping.</p>

    <p>"The reagent work has begun. But Mr. Keorn, we still have something we need your cooperation to complete."</p>

    <p>Shortly after Boss Sun and Immortal Toya left. Zhuo Yi turned his attention to Keorn again.</p>

    <p>Keorn is a smart man. He actually knows exactly what Zhuo Yi wants him to do.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he was not mentally prepared.</p>

    <p>Now Keorn's mood seemed extremely tangled and nervous. Zhuo Yi saw his hand trembling when he lit the cigarette.</p>

    <p>"I'm not scared. It's just..." Keorn tried to explain.</p>

    <p>"I understand you." Zhuo Yi stepped forward and patted Keorn's thick shoulder.</p>

    <p>Now, the burden of revealing the truth has fallen on this man.</p>

    <p>After finishing a cigarette, Keorn pressed the cigarette butt into the ashtray nearby and pressed it hard. Then he took a deep breath and tried to calm down his mood.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo, I'm ready." Keorn stood up.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has prepared a live broadcast room over there. Everything Keorn said below will be broadcast live online. It will be broadcast to all parts of the world.</p>

    <p>In the information age, the communication power of the Internet cannot be underestimated. Once the traffic piles up, it may be more terrifying than the intensity of live television.</p>

    <p>According to the plan, Keorn will reveal the whole story in two parts.</p>

    <p>The first stage. They cannot reveal anything about Xu Ling yet. They need to let the detection reagents fully operate in the market to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, the second stage is when the truth is revealed.</p>

    <p>Keorn will tell everything the Foundation has asked him to investigate in the past 20 years! This also includes the truth about the "Void Invasion!"</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to protect Keorn, Zhuo Yi will appropriately protect Keorn's identity during the first phase of disclosure.</p>

    <p>I will only report the first thing to the outside world as a researcher at the Office of Strategic Deception....</p>

    <p>So. Just in the morning of that day, the video of the first phase of the Office of Strategic Deception was spread all over the Internet with lightning speed.</p>

    <p>The director of the Internet Information Department of the Office of Strategic Deception is none other than Guang Daoren. With the help of one of the leading figures in the live broadcast industry, the speed of spread is simply shocking.</p>

    <p>Morning courseware. Wang Ling found that most people are discussing this matter.</p>

    <p>Mainly. Zhuo Yi In order to let the test reagents circulate. At the same time, in order to make Xu Ling less suspicious. This report is a bit exaggerated...</p>

    <p>At Number 60 High School alone, many students and teachers are beginning to feel a little panicked about their hairlines.</p>

    <p>After class, there is a long queue at the door of both the men's and women's toilets.</p>

    <p>Not for going to the toilet...</p>

    <p>But to look in the mirror.</p>

    <p>"Is the bald flu virus mentioned by the Office of Strategic Deception true or false? Is there any virus in the world that can make people bald?"</p>

    <p>In class. Guo Hao stroked the hair on the top of his head to confirm that his hair was still healthy.</p>

    <p>The person who is least worried about this matter is Chen Chao, because he is originally short-term.</p>

    <p>For him.</p>

    <p>To be bald or not to be bald.</p>

    <p>Actually there is not much difference.</p>

    <p>"Holy shit! I saw someone on the Internet saying that he was bald! He lost a lot of hair overnight. I suspect that he may have contracted the baldness virus!" At this time, someone screamed while scrolling on his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>"Where? Let me see?"</p>

    <p>After hearing the news, everyone came over to watch the fun.</p>

    <p>This is just a screenshot of the chat history. It is all the text of the conversation between two people. There are no pictures.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed without interest.</p>

    <p>Now, things about the "bald head virus" have become hot searches. There are always people who like to take advantage of this time to gain some traffic.</p>

    <p>The Internet spreads too fast. When people do not fully understand unknown things, it is easy to believe all kinds of rumors fabricated by thoughtful people and marketing accounts who "pop out" on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that people are more afraid of baldness than coughs and fevers.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi After announcing the news, the Huaguo Shuilian Group quickly set up testing points across the country.</p>

    <p>All employees have even been mobilized to carry out epidemic prevention work. Testing points have been set up in major public places. Hospitals have been linked to isolate suspected people.</p>

    <p>This kind of reaction speed is already amazing.</p>

    <p>In fact, the vast majority of people are not at risk of baldness... All of this is just a pretense to identify phantoms.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat in his seat and quietly watched the performance of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Over here, someone is working hard.</p>

    <p>On the other side, there are people who are spreading rumors to boost traffic.</p>

    <p>In just one morning, the ginger and garlic in the vegetable market were out of stock...just because the marketing account said that garlic and ginger can prevent hair loss...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I remember if you have crispy noodles with garlic flavor? How about donating some?" At this time, someone turned their attention to Wang Ling and asked.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little broken inside.</p>

    <p>This person is thinking shit...</p>
