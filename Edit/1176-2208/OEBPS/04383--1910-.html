  <h1>Chapter 1910 Damn it. He did it again!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facing the mental barriers set up layer by layer. Wang Ling had been thinking about the possibility of a frontal breakthrough before. The 100 Million Times Heart Sword only broke through the outermost barrier. So if he wanted to break into the core area directly, he still needed to Increase the intensity.</p>

    <p>But the problem before Wang Ling is that he doesn't know how much strength he needs to add. What if he adds too much? He accidentally kills Peng Beicen... This is also It's not what Wang Ling wants to see.</p>

    <p>His original intention was to rescue Peng Beicen and put Peng Beicen out of pain as soon as possible. If he destroyed Peng Beicen directly, the problem would become simpler.</p>

    <p>So at this critical moment, Wang Ling suddenly came to his senses and directly aimed at the star core of Penglai Star. He directly reached into the ground and grabbed the tentacles of the outer god Sayani Gusi.</p>

    <p>Such a roundabout attack suddenly allowed Wang Ling to regain control of the battlefield situation. It was like grabbing a cat by the tail and breaking through directly to the front.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>Harsh sounds came from the void. It was the scream from Sayani Gusi. It sounded like the roar of the Dark Mother Goddess. But in fact, it was Sayani Gusi singing in his own way. Using Languages of the Old World.</p>

    <p>This terrifying alien god is exploding with anger. And it has already seen that the Emperor Dongda in front of it is not the real Emperor Dongda. It knows that there are other souls in the body of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>So it roared in the language of the past. And scolded Wang Ling for the rude behavior of grabbing its tentacles. It swore a dark oath to pull Wang Ling's soul out of the body of the Eastern Emperor.</p>

    <p>Just the next second. Boom!</p>

    <p>Terrifying mental fluctuations were instantly transmitted along the tentacle held by Wang Ling. Electric current generally flowed directly up Wang Ling's fingers.</p>

    <p>If one were to come into direct contact with this mental wave under the Dao Ancestor condition, one would immediately feel a sense of paralysis that spreads up through the fingers and spreads throughout the body.</p>

    <p>Then there will be hallucinations. In more serious cases, you will lose consciousness directly, lose your soul, and enter a state of separation of body and soul. At that time, these terrible alien gods from the old world can eat away the soul.</p>

    <p>But what surprised Sayani Gusi was that this mental fluctuation did not have the slightest impact on the young man in front of him... It was puzzled in its heart. It couldn't understand the young soul living in Dongda's body. What exactly was it? How can it exist.</p>

    <p>A soul of sixteen or seventeen years old. The terrifying strength of an eternal monster. Sayani Gusi could not figure out why a cultivator with a human body could be so powerful.</p>

    <p>Try{mad1('gad2');} catch(ex){}In the secret room. Peng Xiren also stared at the picture projected by the magic weapon in front of him. He stood up from the chair involuntarily. He stared at the servant. His face His expression was trembling. You never expected that a servant could be so powerful.</p>

    <p>"Who...is this person?" Peng Xiren was in a very confused mood at the moment.</p>

    <p>He infinitely admires the power from the old world. In fact, he wants to use this power from the old world to combine it with the way of cultivation he has mastered. Through the mutual blending of the two methods, he can learn from each other's strengths and offset his weaknesses, thus allowing him to become a cultivator. His body surpasses that of a cultivator in the general sense. He becomes the first person in history! He becomes the supreme existence!</p>

    <p>Yes. His ultimate goal is to surpass Dao Ancestor Wang! Become a legend engraved in the history of human cultivators!</p>

    <p>But Peng Xiren never thought that the dream he had been pursuing for many years would actually be defeated by others...</p>

    <p>He is obviously a human cultivator, but he uses his own strength to resist the power of foreign gods from the old world.</p>

    <p>This was something Peng Xiren could never have imagined. At this moment, when he looked at the scene in front of him, he felt his cheeks hurt. It was as if two loud slaps had hit his face.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! This is an alien god! Even if Dao Ancestor Wang comes here in person, he may not be able to defeat him!" Peng Xiren was a little panicked. He was surprised by Wang Ling's methods.</p>

    <p>At this time, he had a vague feeling. He thought that the identity of the young man standing here and dueling with the foreign gods was no ordinary servant. There might even be other unsolved secrets about this person.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling was holding the tentacle. He felt the power of spiritual transmission from Sayani Gusi seeping into his palm.</p>

    <p>However, not only did it not break his spirit, but this mental force was like pouring coffee into him, making his mental state better than before.</p>

    <p>This is not a mental shock at all. For Wang Ling, it is a kind of mental recharging...</p>

    <p>At this time, the thought in Wang Ling's mind is that if I use this to recharge myself when reviewing how to score points before the exam, it should be more effective than drinking eight walnuts.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that this game would be the same as before. The more he played, the more boring he felt. But in the end, this tentacle grabbing thing made him more energetic.</p>

    <p>This time Wang Ling didn't even yawn. He directly grabbed the tentacle caught from the Penglai Galaxy and pulled the entire outer god tentacle out of the ground.</p>

    <p>Then... a horrifying scene happened.</p>

    <p>Try{mad1('gad2');} catch(ex){}I saw Wang Ling dragging the tentacle directly with that small body. It directly pulled Sayani Gusi up. It was as big as a mountain. The dark black piece of meat was connected to the tentacle. The whole thing was held in Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dragged Sayani Gusi in place by dragging its tentacles and began to spin around.</p>

    <p>He was merciless. He directly dragged Sayani Gusi and beat her from left to right. The expression on his face was very relaxed.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine that an alien god would be grabbed by his tentacles by a human boy and pushed to the ground and rubbed without dignity.</p>

    <p>Everyone felt a strong sense of suffocation. Wang Ling was too strong. He was worthy of being a man with the appearance of an immortal king. His movements made the world tremble. The entire Penglai planet shook and roared. Everyone watching the battle was stunned. Jaw dropped. Shocked.</p>

    <p>As Sayani Gusi was continuously beaten back and forth by Wang Ling, the space here was shattered. The void collapsed.</p>

    <p>The poor Dark Mother Goddess was beaten to the point where she couldn't even speak. Those screams and angry sounds from before were swallowed directly into her stomach by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Of course. In addition to sighing at Wang Ling's incredible power, everyone present was also shocked by the Outer God's astonishing blood volume.</p>

    <p>Because this blood is really thick...</p>

    <p>No normal cultivator can withstand a slap from Wang Ling. Even someone as strong as monk Jin Deng can only withstand ten palms from Wang Ling at most.</p>

    <p>This foreign god Sayani Gusi has been beaten by Wang Ling nearly twenty times. He was almost smashed into meat cakes. He still looked like he was doing well. It was really scary.</p>

    <p>After being beaten for thirty times, Wang Ling stretched the muscles on his neck. He took off the outer garments of Dongda, wearing only the base white clothes. Then he took off his clothes. The sleeves were rolled up.</p>

    <p>"Warm up. End."</p>

    <p>At this time, he stared at Sayani Gusi who was thrown to the ground by him and seemed to have fainted. He said coldly.</p>

    <p>The words were extremely brief, but they shocked the faces of everyone present and Peng Xiren in the secret room.</p>

    <p>What did they hear?</p>

    <p>Warm up...warm up?</p>

    <p>The scene of beating the Outer God was so magnificent just now. It was just a warm-up?</p>

    <p>Damn it. He did it again!</p>
