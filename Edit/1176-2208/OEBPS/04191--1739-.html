  <h1>Chapter 1739 The showdown between Jingze and "Wang Ling Buddha"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at the young man in the distance, Wang Muyu fell into a faint daze at first. Then his expression changed to one of deep excitement.</p>

    <p>"Dad..." He instinctively wanted to shout, but Sun Rong covered his mouth.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Your father is... fighting... Muyu, be good. Don't disturb him yet..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu nodded obediently: "Yeah!"</p>

    <p>After releasing Wang Muyu's hand, Sun Rong breathed a sigh of relief. She knew that this was just a temporary measure and could not last too long. With Wang Muyu's personality, he would definitely recognize this "father."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knew that this was actually embarrassing, so she almost subconsciously stopped Wang Muyu's behavior. But in fact, on the other hand, she was actually a little curious about what kind of reaction Wang Ling would show.</p>

    <p>"We'll think of a solution later, Rongrong. He will understand." Wang Ming patted Sun Rong on the shoulder. He smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>At this time, several people stood on the outer platform of the Tian-level laboratory and watched.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that there is a big battle ahead.</p>

    <p>Jingze came fully armed with Eternal Moon's Armor. The original purpose was to capture Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>And now. All his attention is attracted by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As much as you know, as an employee of the company, it is a violation of the Employee Ordinance for you, as a company employee, to be fascinated by foreign affairs in the course of your duties.</p>

    <p>But the words of Monk Jin Deng still lingered in his ears.</p>

    <p>Now after seeing Wang Ling with his own eyes, he found that all the attention in his mind was attracted by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You...are Wang Ling..." He stared at the young man in front of him. Those red dead fish eyes particularly attracted his attention. It seemed as if they could suck him in.</p>

    <p>Quickly, he turned away from his eyes, being careful not to look directly at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He could tell that there was something strange about Wang Ling's eyes. Their origins were unusual. There might be hidden dangers if they looked directly into each other's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren's name. How can you ask?" Death Heavenly Dao took a step forward.</p>

    <p>However, Jingze didn't take him seriously at all: "Haha. Little Heavenly Dao. Go away. You are just a Heavenly Dao. Stop being arrogant. Otherwise, I can destroy you at any time."</p>

    <p>This arrogance made the corners of Heavenly Dao's mouth twitch. He felt that this was the most embarrassing time for him.</p>

    <p>But after thinking about it, he decided to forget it...</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling can help him seek justice later.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was also because Wang Ying was holding him aside and not letting him do anything.</p>

    <p>And seeing Wang Ying trying to break up the fight, Jingze hehe: "Interesting. This is the first time I've seen someone materialize their own shadow to this extent. Why? You brat, you materialize your shadow. It's to help you write. Homework?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying clenched his fists. At the same time, he kept telling himself to be patient.</p>

    <p>At this time, after looking Wang Ling up and down, Jingze sneered again: "Before the monk died, he said you were strong. He asked me to find you. He said I'd understand if I fought with you. But now I see that you're just a young man. You don't seem to be as strong as I thought you were."</p>

    <p>That's what he said. But in fact, Jingze did not relax his vigilance towards Wang Ling at all. Although in Jingze's eyes, Wang Ling looked like an ordinary young man.</p>

    <p>The youthful vigor in him was enough for Jingze to estimate Wang Ling's age.</p>

    <p>Many of those powerful Eternals are sluggish. Because they have lived for too long and relied on their cultivation to build up their longevity, they have long lost the vitality of their youth.</p>

    <p>Even if cultivators can use spells or elixirs to keep themselves young forever, the loss of vitality is irreversible.</p>

    <p>Of course, the presence or absence of vitality has little impact or blessing on strength itself. It can only be used as a way to determine age.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Wang Ling appeared in front of Jingze full of vigor, his thoughts fell into confusion for a brief moment.</p>

    <p>A boy who is only sixteen years old.</p>

    <p>How strong can it be? He was very curious.</p>

    <p>The reason why we are still vigilant now is partly because of the last words of Monk Jin Deng before his death.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was because he had suffered a serious injury at the hands of a baby girl before...</p>

    <p>If he judged correctly, the boy in front of him was the baby girl's brother.</p>

    <p>In this case, we really have to take precautions.</p>

    <p>So now for Jingze, there is a question that has to be raised.</p>

    <p>If the boy in front of me is also a monster...</p>

    <p>So why can two ordinary earthlings give birth to these two monsters?</p>

    <p>Even a genetic mutation would not lead to this...</p>

    <p>At this time, Jingze put on a fighting posture. He showed a parrying posture. He stared at Wang Ling with a burning gaze. The steps under his feet were steady and flexible. There was a bit of murderous intent: "Come on with your skills. You are young. You make the first move."</p>

    <p>His original intention was to let Wang Ling make the first move, so as to test Wang Ling's skills and find flaws in it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked calm.</p>

    <p>He had never heard of such a strange request.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The next second, he turned into a ray of light and quickly rushed to Jingze. As fast as thunder. He took action in an instant! Aiming at Jingze's belly!</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Jingze's hair stood on end instantly. The sense of danger approaching instantly made him terrified. The speed was too fast!</p>

    <p>It's simply outrageous!</p>

    <p>In fact. Wang Ling has not yet used its full strength.</p>

    <p>Because he felt that if he really killed Jingze with one blow, it would be too easy for him.</p>

    <p>Just the matter of Jingze unilaterally harassing Wang Nuan. He felt that he couldn't let it go.</p>

    <p>Although Ah Nuan girl successfully defended herself and did not suffer any harm, the harassment did still occur. In Wang Ling's mind, this alone is enough to be considered a capital crime.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling kicked out. Like a dragon shadow. Extremely fast and fierce.</p>

    <p>He knew that the opponent he was facing was a dragonborn, so he decided to use the dragon-shaped body technique he had mastered to deal with it. This was a provocation and humiliation. Jingze became furious in a brief moment.</p>

    <p>"Earth cultivators will never reach the level of Dragonborn..." He gritted his teeth. He barely reacted and blocked it with his own arm. Wang Ling's kick directly hit his forearm. It was fierce and domineering. It was so shocking that all the bones in his body were shaking.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Jingze felt the qi and blood surge inside his body. There was a stream of blood flowing backwards from deep inside his body. It was almost about to spurt out.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, the Eternal Moon Starlight draped over him was activated at the same time. It emitted a burst of light and bright moonlight, surrounding his body with an airtight aura. Almost at the moment he was injured, he was cured. His surging blood was pushed back.</p>

    <p>This scene made Wang Ling raise his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Because it was also the first time he saw an opponent who could ignore the effects of his serious injuries.</p>

    <p>As a sandbag.</p>

    <p>Jingze. Already qualified.</p>
