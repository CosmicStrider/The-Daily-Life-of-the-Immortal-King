  <h1>Chapter 1182 The Ancestor of Shadow Stream</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The legendary third epic killer... the founder of Shadow Stream. Jiang Yingyue. Killer's domain name: the ancestor of Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>In terms of combat power, when Jiang Yingyue was in his prime, he could be said to be on par with Gorgeous itinerant and Taotie Taoist. However, the masters of the three were not the same person.</p>

    <p>It's just that Er Ha didn't expect that Jiang Yingyue, the legendary ancestor of Shadow Stream who had retired from the world, was actually dead... If she hadn't stood here again as a resurrected person this time, I'm afraid Jiang Yingyue would have been missing until now. To this day, it remains an unsolved mystery in the world of killers.</p>

    <p>But how did Jiang Liuyue die? This made Er Ha deeply curious. In comparison, Wang Zhen and Xiao Yin were not interested in Jiang Liuyue's identity. But he and Liuyue had a bad relationship...</p>

    <p>"Of course, the challenge to the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother failed." Jiang Yingyue said lightly, as if losing to the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother was a normal thing.</p>

    <p>"Have you seen Ghost Ax Spirit Mother?" Er Ha was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Of course I have seen it and fought against her. Although I failed miserably and eventually died from my injuries. But that fight between me and her... is really vivid in my mind." Jiang Yingyue said: "Now I have gained a new hope. I have had the chance. If I see her again, I will definitely take away her title as the ancestor of the killer world with my own hands..."</p>

    <p>"Not only have we met, but we have also fought against each other..." Er Ha was even more surprised. Because he was one of the few people who knew the true identity of Ghost Ax Spirit Mother... He thought Mother Wang was an out-and-out housewife. If in I met a lunatic like Jiang Yingyue on the road. How could I have any room to fight back?</p>

    <p>Er Ha thinks there is something fishy about this matter.</p>

    <p>Although Mother Wang is the real ghost mother, Mother Wang's identity was formed due to various mistakes and coincidences. In fact, over the years, even Mother Wang herself has almost forgotten that she once had a person. The pen name of "Ghost Ax Spirit Mother."</p>

    <p>She didn't even know that she had trained two people with the help of a lost outline.</p>

    <p>Epic killer...</p>

    <p>"Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. I have seen it too." Er Ha raised his head at this time. He was very patient. He was not in a hurry. He just wanted to test whether the person Jiang Yingyue saw was Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>"She is the most special woman I have ever met. Elegant, intellectual and passionate about life. She is definitely a good example of a good wife and mother..." Jiang Yingyue didn't feel the slightest bit about her loss to Ghost Ax Spirit Mother back then. regret.</p>

    <p>Sometimes when the skills are really inferior to others, there really is nothing to complain about.</p>

    <p>Er Ha listened to these adjectives from Jiang Yingyue. At first glance, it seemed that they were indeed describing Mother Wang. When she was still using the pen name "Ghost Ax Spirit Mother", Mother Wang was indeed an intellectual and elegant female writer. She gave birth to a child. Wang Ling later. Mother Wang closed the book again and transformed into a good wife and mother...</p>

    <p>So Er Ha listened to Jiang Yingyue's descriptions. He felt that the impression of Mother Wang in his mind began to become blurry.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang. Is she really a boss?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Er Ha felt that his whole body was in a mess. He had lived in the Wang family's small villa for so many days. He had never found anything unusual about Mother Wang. She was really just a housewife who followed the rules and followed the steps... But Judging from Jiang Yueying's situation, there are indeed signs of fighting between the two.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue glanced up and down at Er Ha. The first thing she did after her resurrection was to understand the development of Liuyue in recent years. As a result, when she learned from the news that Liuyue had failed to attack Number 60 High School to the entire organization was destroyed. It took... a month. When the organization she had planned so hard fell apart in an instant, Jiang Yingyue's heart suddenly collapsed.</p>

    <p>After investigation, Jiang Yingyue found out that the key factor in the failure of Shadow Stream was due to his too indecisive style and lack of certain combat experience.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Jiang Yingyue specially formulated a new plan! Named! In it, she carefully planned the grand blueprint for the future development of Liuyue. She also sorted out the objects that needed revenge.</p>

    <p>And Er Ha. is suddenly on Jiang Yingyue's revenge list.</p>

    <p>"In my revenge plan. I remember there was a green-haired dog..." At this time, Jiang Yingyue focused on Er Ha. Her slender eyes narrowed into slits, revealing a bit of cunning.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the ancestor of the shadow stream is worthy of being the ancestor of the shadow stream. Even though Er Ha has successfully trained into a human form, she can still see through at a glance that Er Ha's true form is actually a green-haired Akita dog.</p>

    <p>There are many Akita dogs who have awakened their intelligence these days. But how many are there with green hair?</p>

    <p>Jiang Yueying understood Er Ha's true identity almost instantly. He did not use any pupil power or magic weapon to identify it. Instead, he simply relied on his combat experience as the ancestor of Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>Her strength is not inferior to Gorgeous itinerant and Taotie Taoist.</p>

    <p>However, Jiang Yueying still felt a little incredible about Er Ha's appearance: "I didn't find that you actually met the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. And... you saw her. And you still survived?"</p>

    <p>"Before the duel between Ghost Ax Spirit Mother and me, she signed a life and death agreement with me. If she dies during the fight, no one is allowed to cause trouble to anyone... She said to me, anyone who has seen her true form "Death is certain." After Jiang Yueying finished speaking, the look in Er Ha's eyes became even more strange: "You actually saw the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother and survived?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>He is not!</p>

    <p>He didn't!</p>

    <p>During the time he lived in the Wang family's small villa, he and Mother Wang looked up and down every day... Mother Wang didn't say that she would kill him just because he saw her true face!</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha really felt that there might be some profound misunderstanding...</p>

    <p>It is obvious that this misunderstanding cannot be explained clearly in words for a while.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yueying lost to the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother at the beginning. Her biggest hope after her resurrection is to sum up the experience of previous failures and fight against the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother again.</p>

    <p>But now, in Jiang Yueying's opinion, this wish can no longer be fully realized.</p>

    <p>The Ghost Ax Spirit Mother said that anyone who has seen her true form will die... This dog has seen the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother but survived. Does that mean that this green-haired dog will kill the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother? Kill?</p>

    <p>After sorting out her thoughts, Jiang Yueying stared at Er Ha again. At the same time, the expression on her face became a bit more gloomy: "Did you kill Ghost Ax Spirit Mother?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yueying: "Since you killed the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother, it means that your strength is higher than the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother... Then, as long as I kill you, it will prove that I am the ancestor of the world's number one killer. !"</p>

    <p>"I think there may be some misunderstanding here..." Er Ha quickly tried to dissuade him. He was not afraid. He just felt that the matter was not completely clear yet.</p>

    <p>However, how could Jiang Yueying be willing to give it a chance?</p>

    <p>The next moment, the woman in front of her formed a dharma seal with her hands. Her whole body was divided into dozens of shadows, surrounding Er Ha!</p>

    <p>The method of multiple clones!</p>

    <p>Er Ha's eyes suddenly became alert.</p>

    <p>This woman isn't kidding... she's serious!</p>

    <p>:.:</p>
