  <h1>Chapter 1678 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's our turn!" Xiang Yi was lying on the ground and roared. He couldn't help but see such a coordinated battle.</p>

    <p>As a qualified sniper, the most important thing is to be calm. However, when everyone works together to face such a terrifying ancient god giant, everyone can't help but show excitement. They can't help but feel a sense of excitement all over their body. The blood is boiling.</p>

    <p>His Nine Sun Divine Sword finally came into use after lurking in the Virtual Realm for a long time!</p>

    <p>At this time, Xiang Yi took a deep breath and focused all his attention on the 3.2 billion light-year high-power sight.</p>

    <p>This is a sniping distance of ten thousand years at a glance. There is no need to consider any sniping angle. You only need to lock your breath to the left and right arms of this ancient god giant as you do now. Then you can automatically lock the enemy. You can say where it is. Where to hit.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in this brief moment of aiming, everyone can feel that this huge Nine Sun Divine Sword sniper rifle is emitting a dazzling silver light. This is a material phenomenon caused by the overflow of spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>"I see. Is it possible to superimpose the power of bullets through the blessing of one's own cultivation..." Jin Deng said slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>There is no magazine in this Nine Sun Divine Sword. All bullets are condensed by Xiang Yi through his own cultivation. In other words, the strength of the bullets can be controlled by Xiang Yi himself.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is!</p>

    <p>Since the bullet has the ability to be recycled, even after being fired, it can automatically return to Xiang Yi. There will be no waste of cultivation at all!</p>

    <p>And this is the so-called eternal movement of cultivation!</p>

    <p>However, Xiang Yi looked very young. Monk Jin Deng originally thought that the cultivation level fused into this bullet might not be much.</p>

    <p>However, the next moment, the slap in the face came unexpectedly.</p>

    <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

    <p>It was obviously a sniper rifle. It actually made a roaring sound like a cannonball from the muzzle.</p>

    <p>"Senior Xiang is so strong!" Sun Rong Although I don't know how Xiang Yi did it.</p>

    <p>But two silver bullets carrying Xiang Yi's 2000 years of cultivation!</p>

    <p>It just turned into two straight lights. It attacked the ancient god giant's right arm one after another!</p>

    <p>"Bullets worth 2,000 years of cultivation? Two bullets equal 4,000 years of cultivation... This shouldn't be all your power, right?" The expression on Qin Zhong's face was also extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>Because Xiang Yi looks younger than him. He doesn't seem to have this level of Taoism.</p>

    <p>If it is possible to achieve this level of cultivation at such a young age, there is only one possibility that Qin Zhong can think of. That is that Xiang Yi may have entered a place similar to the "realm of time."</p>

    <p>It is a mysterious place floating in the universe. Under normal circumstances, it is difficult to find the entrance. But because the flow rate is very slow, it can stay there for a year. The outside world has only just passed a day.</p>

    <p>He thought that Xiang Yi's Taoism came from there.</p>

    <p>But in fact this is not the case at all.</p>

    <p>"I see. In addition to traveling through the realm of time. You can borrow the heavens."</p>

    <p>"Borrow the heavens?" This statement made everyone around us stare in disbelief. It was the first time most of them had ever heard of such an expression.</p>

    <p>"To put it simply, when you are strong, be strong." Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>"Borrowing Heaven." This is not an ability that everyone has.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng can see that Xiang Yi is a person with a story, and it is indeed impressive to have such an ability.</p>

    <p>This ability to become stronger when faced with strength may be useless to other people, but it doesn't hurt to Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>Because this is borrowing heaven. What you are borrowing is someone else's heaven!</p>

    <p>He can borrow the talent of anyone here. After converting it into cultivation level, it will be condensed into the bullet and shot!</p>

    <p>In other words, the two bullets with a 2000-year-old cultivation level just now, a total of 4000-year-old bullets, may not all come from Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>The total amount of work they have done here spans tens of thousands of years.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi can be extracted according to the needs of the situation.</p>

    <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

    <p>Just as everyone was thinking, two silver bullets quickly hit the ancient god giant's left and right arms.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Nawei wanted to reach out to block it. However, Xiang Yi's bullet began to turn the moment it approached. It made an arc from a weird angle and hit the ancient god giant's arms from behind.</p>

    <p>In an instant, two huge mushroom clouds were blown up by the silver bullets, blowing out two huge holes in both arms.</p>

    <p>"A bunch of trash. They are worthy of contending with me." However, on the other side, Nawei made a sound of disdain. Although the hole was blown out of his arm, it was quickly restored at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>The self-healing ability of the Ancient God Giant is extremely fast. With the superposition of the power of 27,000 New Ancient Divine Weapons, the self-healing speed has also reached 27,000 times as much as before.</p>

    <p>It was just blown into pieces. There was no way to affect it at all.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, these two bullets are just Xiang Yi's tentative design.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>At this moment. Suddenly! A silver bullet that was fused with 8,000 years of cultivation erupted from the muzzle of the Nine Yang Divine Sword's sniper rifle!</p>

    <p>It shoots forward with a devastating force and a destructive lethality!</p>

    <p>Under the huge roar, countless space cracks were formed as the bullets passed by. Wherever the silver bullet passed, it was like a sky-shattering aurora. It seemed to have the power to kill gods! It carried a terrifying aura!</p>

    <p>It was just a bullet. It turned into an aurora and passed by the earth. It split the land in front of me into two. The strong air wave tore it apart and divided it completely!</p>

    <p>Countless gravel and rubble rose up as the space shattered!</p>

    <p>Once it hits, it can knock down the sun, moon and stars in the sky!</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi curled his lips slightly. From a long distance away, he could already feel Nawei's fear of his silver bullet.</p>

    <p>It began to put up a huge gray-gold barrier in an attempt to resist the attack of silver bullets.</p>

    <p>However, the power of the silver bullet is too powerful!</p>

    <p>A bullet with 8000 years of cultivation has its own armor-piercing power. Almost the moment it comes into contact with the barrier, cracks have appeared on the surface of the barrier.</p>

    <p>Although he was clearly in Nawei's own supreme world, he was always being passively beaten. This made Nawei extremely unhappy.</p>

    <p>Blind defense will definitely not work.</p>

    <p>However, resisting this 8,000-year-old bullet has made him unable to separate himself.</p>

    <p>So in the next second, his true body appeared directly from the eyebrows of the ancient god giant.</p>

    <p>But he only leaned out half of his body. His brain was connected by countless tubes. There were also many disgusting crushes on his body.</p>

    <p>There was a pale beam of light converging from his mouth.</p>

    <p>"It's the ancient divine jade! A shelling that condenses cultivation!" Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"Ancient Divine Jade? I thought it was a Tailed Beast Jade... But then again, aren't these cultivations different from Senior Xiang Yi's bullets? They cannot be recycled." Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong was wrong. Essentially, there is no difference." Jin Deng explained; "This is his supreme world. This cannon, which condensed his own cultivation, was ultimately consumed in his supreme world." is also another kind of cycle."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Rong nodded. She was about to step forward and open Aohai's barrier. But at this moment, Qin Zhong stepped forward and blocked everyone.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior Qin? You..."</p>

    <p>At this time, I saw him crossing his arms confidently.</p>

    <p>Finally the Koi is revealed as a Koi. The arrogant face: "Miss Rong, don't waste your energy. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Even if I stand here and let him hit me. He' ll still miss."</p>
