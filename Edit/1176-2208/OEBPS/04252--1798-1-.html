  <h1>Chapter 1798 A major force that has been ignored</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"hehe..."</p>

    <p>Faced with such a question, Mrs. Lawen was fearless. There was a hint of disdain in her unusually soft laughter, with a kind of confidence and calmness: "I respect the church. I also believe in the Virgin Mary. The brilliance of the Virgin Mary's existence will shine forever. Deep in everyone's heart, illuminate this kingdom forever. But this kingdom does not belong to the Virgin, nor does it belong to any of us."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen paused. She opened her eyes and said, "Including this city called Glio City, the same is true. We should trust each other and abide by our duties. Instead of doing fearless things here. A war of words."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, inside the bright St. Peter's Cathedral, a burst of loud applause was refracted through the glazed tiles of the dome and spread throughout the church.</p>

    <p>A heroic man with long blond hair applauded from the entrance of the church and walked along the red carpet. He was wearing a bright military uniform. The gorgeous shoulder pads were decorated with general badges. The front of his chest was covered with military honors. As always, there is a kind of publicity unique to Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Lawen said that well. But now it seems obvious that someone doesn't want us to do this."</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi held the general's sword hanging on his waist tightly and said: "Between you and Levi, one is white and the other is black. Rather than being in opposition, it is better to seek symbiosis. The church is the link that maintains us. There is no need to be at odds with the church."</p>

    <p>Having said this, he faced the Virgin devoutly and made a prayer gesture: "After all, if you have trouble with the church, you will have trouble with the Virgin... The three of us gathered here are definitely not here to carve up the city of Glio."</p>

    <p>"Maiko Assi. I didn't expect that a big guy like you could say such literary and artistic words. It's really interesting. When did you start to learn to pray? I remember. You are not a very qualified person." Levis said with a smile. His voice was cold. Even when facing Maiko Assi, he was still fearless.</p>

    <p>"I am like this because of the influence of my daughter. She has become more well-behaved recently. She seems to be obsessed with a literary organization and is starting to become interested in learning."</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi smiled and said: "I don't want her to be like me. Walking my way... my way is not easy to walk. It is easy to encounter wild dogs on the road."</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the light of the sword struck down, bringing with it the glass that enveloped the church. The chair Levis sat on was cut into pieces in public. Levis did not react in time and fell down on the broken wood.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi's shot was too fast. He didn't realize it at all. He fell to the ground in an instant.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt. This is a shame. Levis was about to yell when he saw Maiko Assi, who was standing in front of the portrait of the Virgin, turning half of his face to look at him. There was a faint murderous intent in his eyes. Instantly, from the top of his head, He poured it down along his spine: "Levis, my tolerance for you is still limited to the face of the Holy Mother. If it weren't for the church, you and your Chilan Society would have died without a burial place. Next time, if you dare to talk nonsense again, your head will explode."</p>

    <p>There was murderous intent in his eyes. It was the look of a tiger staring at its prey. Levis sat on the ground, trying to stay calm.</p>

    <p>Meiko Assi. It is just as rumored. He became stronger after coming out of seclusion...</p>

    <p>If he hadn't spared that sword blow just now, I'm afraid his life would have been hard to save.</p>

    <p>But even so, Levi's face did not show the slightest fear. Supported by an inexplicable confidence, his eyes met Maiko Assi's again.</p>

    <p>"It might be a blessing to have my head taken off by this legendary general in person. But Maiko Assi, can you really take it off?" Levis laughed.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen frowned deeply when she heard this. This was undoubtedly a provocation. And it was in such a disparity in strength. Even Madam Lawen herself was not sure whether she had a chance of winning against Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>Levi's strength is so disparate that he dares to openly challenge him. Even with the support of the church, such confidence may not be enough.</p>

    <p>"Kill!" Maiko Assi was obviously irritated. His eyes were dark, with an unspeakable coldness and murderous intent.</p>

    <p>The silver sword light intertwined with the glazed halo on the dome. It aimed at Levi's head. Such killing intent and momentum were really too awe-inspiring. Mrs. Lawen had no doubt that Levi's head would soon be chopped off.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>However, in the next second, when Levi's and sword lights were about to intersect, a golden bullet penetrated from a distance. It shot out with brilliant light and fire, and exploded like the sun.</p>

    <p>The light was so blazing that it stung the eyes of Maiko Assi and Lady Lawen.</p>

    <p>A golden bullet. Accurately blocked Maiko Assi's fatal sword. Saved Levi's head at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>"Who dares to block my sword?" Maiko Assi was furious. He didn't expect that his sword would be blocked at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>"General, please be patient. I'm here to make peace."</p>

    <p>A squinty-eyed man with short ear-length hair and a single-sided glasses, wearing a dark blue coat, slowly walked in from a distance.</p>

    <p>"You are..." The sharpness in Maiko Assi's eyes instantly faded. He stared at the person and frowned deeply. He felt that the moire mark on this person's coat seemed to have been seen somewhere before.</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao alliance."</p>

    <p>The man with narrowed eyes spoke. He blew a wisp of smoke from the barrel of the gun.</p>

    <p>The golden bullet just now was shot by him.</p>

    <p>That bullet contained immortal energy. It was extremely powerful. It was a bullet condensed with cultivation. It directly blocked his general sword. This proves that this gun is at least a high-level anti-world magic weapon.</p>

    <p>"General Maiko Assi, don't get me wrong. I didn't mean to offend you. I am not strong. It is only because of this Heavenly Dao gun issued by the Heavenly Dao Alliance that I have a certain say in this world."</p>

    <p>The man with narrowed eyes smiled and said: "Let me introduce you. I am the leader of the Heavenly Dao Alliance. Pei Luoqi."</p>

    <p>A group leader?</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Throughout Heavenly Dao, there are always six groups of people.</p>

    <p>One group's strength is the most astonishing.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi, the captain of the team, is known as the Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi had heard of this person's name a long time ago.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that this person would be the squinting man in front of me with a weird voice and a smile that hides a knife.</p>

    <p>"I told you a long story, General Maiko Assi. The purpose of my coming here is to mediate."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi said: "Originally, I had no intention of getting involved in this matter, because recently my son has become obsessed with studying because of a literary organization. I originally wanted to stay at home to tutor him in his homework. But now you are in Glio City. You are fiercely arguing. As a team leader, I had to intervene in this matter."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he looked around at Maiko Assi, Mrs. Lawen and Levis, and said: "My Heavenly Dao gun is not here to protect anyone. What I am doing is to transform your conflicts into a unified external force. Bullets of Justice..."</p>
