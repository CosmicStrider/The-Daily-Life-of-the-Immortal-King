  <h1>Chapter 1703 A cultivation enterprise that operates in the air</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Death Heavenly Dao was summoned by Wang Ling, he was still wearing the uniform of the 60 High School guard captain. The original school guard captain, Old Man Li, had reached the age of retirement, so he gave up his position to Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>As soon as Death Heavenly Dao was moved, he added two hundred years to Old Man Li's life in the book of life and death. It was a real gain.</p>

    <p>No one wants to have a colleague who works with them every day. A man who can freely control other people's life and death...</p>

    <p>But resurrecting others, even if Death Heavenly Dao does it himself, is a bit illegal.</p>

    <p>The rule left by Dao Ancestor Wang when he established the Heavenly Dao Committee is that those who have to be resurrected must first go through the upward filing. That is, after the Heavenly Dao Committee has established the file, it must be reviewed and approved by the six masters of Heavenly Dao before their twin brothers can be resurrected. The two went to execute it.</p>

    <p>The two brothers actually had a division of labor in the entire resurrection process.</p>

    <p>Like his brother, Life Heavenly Dao whose main responsibility for resurrection is the type of subjective death, what is meant by subjective death?</p>

    <p>For example, if someone is dying due to illness or even commits suicide, it is considered a subjective death.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Death Heavenly Dao deals more with accidental deaths.</p>

    <p>But the situation with the courier guy in front of me is a little complicated.</p>

    <p>Although it is true that he had a car accident in advance because he was invaded by the Thought Plague. But in fact, at the same time as the car accident happened.</p>

    <p>Diseases caused by long-term overtime work will manifest at that moment.</p>

    <p>Almost at the moment he was hit and killed, the courier boy suffered a myocardial infarction at the same time, leading to cardiac capture and suffocation.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Because he had been riding a tricycle for a long time, the courier boy also suffered from severe rheumatism. The moment he was hit hard, all the bones in his body cracked.</p>

    <p>At the moment he was hit, the poor courier boy died suddenly due to multiple reasons. And each death occurred almost at the same moment. All of them were fatal injuries.</p>

    <p>The thought plague that invaded his body obviously didn't notice this. It was still controlling his body. In the end, it was directly burned into coke by the big explosion. It was completely inhuman...</p>

    <p>"It's too tragic." Heavenly Dao sighed as he explained the cause of the courier boy's death.</p>

    <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Just tell me whether you can be resurrected." Wang Ying looked heavy.</p>

    <p>A Wang Ling and a Wang Ying sandwiched Death Heavenly Dao. Death Heavenly Dao was also frightened in his heart. His pupils shrank slightly and he said cowardly: "If this can... make both Ling Zhenren and Ying Zhenren both spoke, how can I disobey you?"</p>

    <p>Promoting someone's resurrection against the rules is essentially a serious violation of discipline. However, with Wang Ling and Wang Ying standing behind him, Death Heavenly Dao was somewhat confident.</p>

    <p>"The rules back then were set by Dao Ancestor Wang. If I resurrect these humans, what punishment will I receive? You two adults must help me..." Death Heavenly Dao bowed.</p>

    <p>You may not believe it. As one of the six lords Heavenly Dao, Death Heavenly Dao himself is also very afraid of death.</p>

    <p>"Stop talking nonsense and start immediately." Wang Ying said concisely and to the point.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao no longer shirks the blame. He takes a step back and releases a jet-black spiritual flame from his fingertips. Then he raises his sword fingers together and points directly at the forehead of the charred corpse.</p>

    <p>The corpse, which had been burned to the point where the human form was no longer visible, was rapidly recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"It's an advantage for him. This is a brand new body." Death Heavenly Dao said, crossing his arms.</p>

    <p>After resurrecting a person, the resurrected person will also get a completely healthy body. No matter what kind of pain and disease he has suffered before, the body after death will be completely sound.</p>

    <p>However, according to the bad habits of modern human cultivators that are difficult to change in life, they will eventually develop into a sub-healthy state.</p>

    <p>This is really a pity.</p>

    <p>As if he had experienced a long sleep, the courier boy woke up from the sterile corpse bed in the morgue. He rubbed his eyes.</p>

    <p>He remembered that he had just been walking on a long and narrow Golden Bridge. There were floating Golden Men beside the Golden Bridge, ladling a bowl of golden soup to everyone standing on the Golden Bridge.</p>

    <p>The Mengpo soup mentioned by the people and this golden soup are actually the same thing.</p>

    <p>This is a prop used by Heavenly Dao to block the soul's memory of past lives.</p>

    <p>But just when the courier boy was about to drink, a black flame ignited from the bowl of golden soup in his hand. He was so frightened that he knocked over the soup bowl.</p>

    <p>At the scene of the golden bridge, amidst the chaos, he was sucked away by the cracks made by the black flames...</p>

    <p>When he woke up, he saw three men in front of him, all with their arms folded, surrounding his bed.</p>

    <p>"You..." He was very frightened. But this excitement reminded him of something.</p>

    <p>During the period when he was invaded by the Thought Plague, although his body was completely out of his control, he still remembered what he had done.</p>

    <p>A person with the Thought Plague would never have thought that a person who had been destroyed by him would be resurrected under such circumstances. And he would still have all the memories of when he was controlled by it.</p>

    <p>"You just need to know that you were in a car accident and we saved you. Now, don't ask any more questions. You just need to tell us everything you did while you were being manipulated." Wang Ying said in a cold voice.</p>

    <p>"Baobai!"</p>

    <p>The courier boy said as if he was enlightened.</p>

    <p>"Baobai?"</p>

    <p>"Eh...During the period when my body was being manipulated, I went to a company that I had never seen before. I had never seen a company that could move like this..."</p>

    <p>"A company that can move?" Heavenly Dao was also stunned when he heard this: "Could this company be in some kind of aircraft?"</p>

    <p>Floating offices with no fixed abode are indeed very popular nowadays. Floating flying offices are now also the mainstream trend of future companies in the cultivation world. Although the company's location is constantly changing, it can use this advantage to easily recruit talents from all over the country.</p>

    <p>The biggest advantage of this kind of floating office is that the floating boat will float through each designated city according to its own fixed cycle. This allows many migrant workers from other places to take the company's SF Express car to go home often.</p>

    <p>However, there are still very few floating aerial companies that can master this cutting-edge technology. Only a very wealthy consortium has the material and financial resources to operate.</p>

    <p>However, the "Baobai Company" mentioned by the courier boy seems to be a new term among the limited number of air companies. Before that, advertisements for famous air companies were all over the sky. But Wang Ling has never I've heard of it.</p>

    <p>And he doesn't know why. He feels that this company name has a familiar feeling...</p>
