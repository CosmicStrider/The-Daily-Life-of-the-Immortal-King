  <h1>Chapter 1250 The Foundation's Revenge</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The words of the Book of Sage Immortal actually reminded Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The so-called Son of the Void may not necessarily be male. And Sun Rong does have a certain probability of being the Son of the Void.</p>

    <p>After the Jiulong Mountain National Physical Education Exchange Competition, Sun Rong was clearly not injured. However, he was still closely protected by the group.</p>

    <p>Listen to what Old Gudong said. Sun Rong will even take a break from school to rest in the next period of time.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid that Mr. Boss Sun has noticed that there may be some problems with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But these are all just inferences from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, judging from the current ranking calculations, the probability that Sun Rong is the Son of the Void ranks at the bottom.</p>

    <p>Therefore, what is more important now is to collect more ethereal samples to make the predicted probability of the Book of Sage Immortal more accurate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has already had a premonition. Those messengers from the Foundation who have been silenced behind the scenes may appear one after another in the future.</p>

    <p>Since the last time they entered the spiritual space, Wang Ling has left a trace of divine thoughts on every messenger of the foundation.</p>

    <p>And it was just as Wang Ling expected. Xu Bai was already a little suspicious of him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in the latest meeting, the messenger of the Fool position was eliminated.</p>

    <p>And their next act of revenge is against Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling looked at the peach wood sword beside his pillow.</p>

    <p>Although Bai Qiao is already in the hands of Zhuo Yi, just in case. Wang Ling feels that it would be safer to send Jingke to Zhuo Yi as well.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master..."</p>

    <p>Hearing Wang Ling's inner call, Jingke's sword trembled slightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said no more. He looked directly at the direction where Zhuo Yi was.</p>

    <p>Jingke understood. Then it quickly turned into a brown stream of light and rushed out of the window.</p>

    <p>After Jingke and Bai Qiao merge, they will become Jingbai.</p>

    <p>As for Jingbai's combat power, Wang Ling has already seen it.</p>

    <p>Even the Thousand-Winged God can clear it all with one sword. Not to mention the mere Void Spirit.</p>

    <p>In fact. This is also Wang Ling taking the initiative to provide an opportunity for Jingke and Bai Qiao to unite.</p>

    <p>It's the first time to get together. Because we have to adapt to each other, the time to get together doesn't take too long.</p>

    <p>This requires polishing over time.</p>

    <p>And this second chance is coming. Wang Ling feels that the combination of Jingke and Bai Qiao should last longer.</p>

    <p>When can I survive twenty-four hours? This is a real man.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is not convenient for him to keep track of him personally at the moment.</p>

    <p>Because Xu Bai's ultimate goal is still himself.</p>

    <p>There is bound to be a slap fight between them.</p>

    <p>If he goes to Sun Rong to keep an eye on him, Xu Bai will definitely be attracted by him.</p>

    <p>By then, I'm afraid everyone nearby will suffer.</p>

    <p>So at this time. Wang Ling turned his attention to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stood up and yawned: "I understand, I understand. Let me watch over there."</p>

    <p>Er Ha has no choice but to help.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that he feels that Wang Ling is really tired these days.</p>

    <p>His little master also has to deal with exams and homework on one side. On the other side, he also has to care about the common people and fight against "aliens"... It's really not easy!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. The first station command center for epidemic prevention in the western suburbs of Songhai City.</p>

    <p>While Zhuo Yi is waiting for the results of the Immortal Toya test orb, it also received the first list from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There are only four people on the list.</p>

    <p>Because Sun Rong over there Wang Ling has sent Er Ha to follow.</p>

    <p>So the remaining four people are fully responsible for Zhuo Yi. It would be better to allocate personnel to keep an eye on them.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master... he actually determined the general scope of the Sons of the Void so quickly." Zhuo Yi looked at the list and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Gao Tianming, Jiang Xiaoche, Xiang Haitao, Yi Zhiyang." Beside him, Keorn recited the four names on the famous list. He frowned deeply: "This Yi Zhiyang. I really think it sounds familiar. I seem to have heard it somewhere."</p>

    <p>"This is the adopted son of Sword Master General Yi Jianchuan. How do you know Mr. Keorn?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's words. In fact, he was still testing Keorn. He had already known from Wang Ling about the relationship between Yi Zhiyang and "Toyi Dere", the tank messenger behind the foundation.</p>

    <p>He wanted to test whether Keorn knew about this matter.</p>

    <p>Keorn frowned: "I once accidentally saw a file submitted by a colleague. This name was recorded on it. By the way...there is absolutely no mistake. I remember that the boss of a multinational spirit sword production group asked Yi Dere once entrusted our foundation to investigate this person named Yi Zhiyang."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Zhuo Yi was shocked.</p>

    <p>He secretly marveled at the boldness of this chariot messenger.</p>

    <p>He is obviously a messenger of the foundation. But he takes the initiative to use his true identity to appoint the foundation to investigate the matter of his illegitimate child.</p>

    <p>What a good plan.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help but smile inside.</p>

    <p>The identities of the seven emissaries of the Foundation are kept secret from each other.</p>

    <p>By doing this, the envoy in this chariot position can actually play the confusion card and hide his identity.</p>

    <p>But Toy Del Rey clearly miscalculated.</p>

    <p>He would never have imagined that almost nothing that happened on this earth could escape the eyes of his Wang Ling master's enlightened IPAD.</p>

    <p>"I'm very happy that Mr. Keorn didn't hide anything from me. So I decided to tell Mr. Keorn something." At this time, Zhuo Yi looked at Keorn and said, "Actually, this Toy Del Rey is the Foundation. The messenger behind the chariot."</p>

    <p>The news shocked Keorn.</p>

    <p>Chariot Messenger. Is he actually Toy Del Rey?</p>

    <p>They had speculated more than once before that there might be someone within the General Alliance of Huaxiu country colluding secretly with the foundation.</p>

    <p>If Toy Del Rey were the Messenger of the Chariot.</p>

    <p>There is another connection between him and Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>And Yi Zhiyang himself is the adopted son of General Yi...</p>

    <p>Judging from the current evidence, General Yi's suspicion becomes very high.</p>

    <p>"He is a sword master..."</p>

    <p>Keorn was a little unbelievable. Even he, an outsider, found all of this unbelievable.</p>

    <p>"I know."Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>This is a man who has made great contributions to the founding of Huaxiu. He has outstanding achievements and is loyal. There is almost no possibility of betraying the General Alliance.</p>

    <p>However, a large number of facts show that the current suspicion of General Yi is indeed high.</p>

    <p>"We only follow evidence and facts." At this time, Zhuo Yi said with emotion: "I am also a fan of Master Juggernaut...I don't believe he would do such a thing. But Mr. Keorn, have you ever thought about it?" Yes. Maybe there is another possibility?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Speaking of this, Keorn suddenly realized. He opened his blue eyes in shock: "You mean..."</p>

    <p>"I suspect. The Sword Master may have been invaded by the void."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>This is the only reasonable explanation that Zhuo Yi can think of at the moment.</p>

    <p>But then the situation becomes very troublesome...</p>

    <p>With General Yi's own combat power, coupled with the combat power of the ethereal spirit in his body, it is probably even more amazing than Snake!</p>

    <p>The key is. The way they handle General Yi.</p>

    <p>The realm of the Sword Master is so high. The virtual spirit that invades his body will never be easily shaken like the virtual spirit of Mr. Liu from Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>Without full confidence in forcing the virtual spirit out of the body, Zhuo Yi could only think of one other way.</p>

    <p>That is.</p>

    <p>Kill the Juggernaut...</p>
