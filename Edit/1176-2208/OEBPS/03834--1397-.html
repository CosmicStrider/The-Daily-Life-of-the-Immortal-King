  <h1>Chapter 1397 Exploring the Sword King Realm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Er Ha's reminder, Sun Rong finally discovered the blind spot that appeared when checking letters.</p>

    <p>All the letters here seem to be titled "Classmate Wang."</p>

    <p>And a very strange thing is that there is a strange gap between the characters "çŽ‹" and "Classmate" in many letters.</p>

    <p>If these letters were not originally written to Wang Ling, then everything seems to make sense now.</p>

    <p>"Do you believe Brother Wang Zhen... But why did he do this?" Sun Rong was full of doubts. But after knowing the whole story, Sun Rong felt a lot relieved.</p>

    <p>"It's probably just a prank. I want to see your reaction." Er Ha hit the nail on the head.</p>

    <p>"My... reaction?" Sun Rong sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>She is too difficult. The road to chasing Wang Ling is already difficult enough.</p>

    <p>They also have to be "molested" by these seniors in the world of cultivation one by one.</p>

    <p>"So does Sister Qingyi know about this?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I probably don't know." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked calm and showed a kind smile: "Then I think she needs to know."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "So now. There is only one person left."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was puzzled: "What kind of person?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Now I know. The letters written on the letterhead to classmate Wang are all addressed to brother Wang Zhen. These can be eliminated. Then there is only one letter left."</p>

    <p>"There is actually a real love letter?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Sun Ying'er were both stunned after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"Well. The letter on the letterhead is classmate Wang Ling. And this was originally the focus of the nine letters I selected." Sun Rong took out the pink-covered letter from the nine letters. said.</p>

    <p>"Do you need me to help you find it?"</p>

    <p>"No need. This girl has already written down the address and signature."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned slightly: "Her name is Jiang Yingying."</p>

    <p>"Jiang Yingying?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that this girl's name seemed familiar. It seemed as if she had heard it somewhere.</p>

    <p>It feels like this matter has become a bit complicated...</p>

    <p>"Collect the Rubik's Cube first. Anyway, there is only one opponent. When I come back, I will meet her in person." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>From the original nine "opponents" to one "opponent", this really relieved a lot of the burden on the girl's heart.</p>

    <p>"So where is the third Rubik's Cube?" Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>"Sword King Realm."</p>

    <p>Er Ha raised his dog's head. He looked at Sun Rong and said, "It is said that this is the place where Master Jingke was born."</p>

    <p>At that time, the monk repeatedly broke into the Sword King Realm in order to collect the ancient pillars of the Sword King. It was a very dangerous secret realm in the universe! The location was in the Eastern District of the Extraterrestrial Galaxy!</p>

    <p>There is a sword storm outside the Sword King Realm, accompanied by a strong gravitational force. If you are not strong enough, you will be immediately drawn in and crushed to pieces.</p>

    <p>So overall, the difficulty of this mission is no easier than the last time.</p>

    <p>Even far more dangerous than the Heavenly Dao planet.</p>

    <p>However, the main danger is focused on external breakthroughs. As long as you can successfully break through the Blade Storm, it will be much easier to move within the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth operation, another core member of the Office of Strategic Deception came to help this time.</p>

    <p>"Sir Bai Qiao, you can come out now." Er Ha looked out the window and shouted.</p>

    <p>Along with a brown sword light passing through the window, the white-haired otaku girl with headphones hanging around her neck appeared in front of everyone. She was still wearing the iconic one-piece pajamas of the fire-breathing dragon.</p>

    <p>"Senior Bai Qiao!" Sun Rong greeted.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's face was a little red: "Hurry up and work! I took the time to help you. I hope you can recover the Rubik's Cube more quickly. Don't waste time by being clumsy! Humph!"</p>

    <p>Facing such venomous words, Sun Rong was not only not angry. On the contrary, he felt that the girl in front of him was a bit cute.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's character is like this. Sun Rong remembers Zhuo Yi telling himself about the experience of searching for Bai Qiao. At that time, Bai Qiao beat everyone with his mouth. Even Wang Ling never let go.</p>

    <p>So for Bai Qiao, as long as the reverse understanding is achieved, there will be no problem.</p>

    <p>"Lord Ma has never been to the inside of the Sword King Realm. He can only teleport us to the outside. Breaking through the sword storm is difficult. But I think Master Bai Qiao has already thought of a way, right?" Er Ha waggled his tail and talked to him as pleasantly as possible. Bai Qiao had a conversation.</p>

    <p>It actually doesn't like Bai Qiao's character very much. But for Jingke's sake, Er Ha always has to give him some face.</p>

    <p>"A bunch of trash."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao snorted. Then he transformed himself into the form of a scabbard.</p>

    <p>The small scabbard gradually enlarged after a burst of halo changes, and then turned into a small immortal ship the size of a sports car.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Sun Rong's bedroom is spacious enough. Even if there is an additional small immortal ship, it will not make people feel crowded.</p>

    <p>"How can it still be like this?"</p>

    <p>This was the first time even Er Ha had seen such a scabbard shape. He was surprised.</p>

    <p>"This is a skin transformation technique." Bai Qiao said.</p>

    <p>When it comes to playing games, it doesn't matter if your skills are not good sometimes. Your skin must look good.</p>

    <p>As a senior otaku, Bai Qiao also has in-depth research on the skin of her scabbard. Therefore, she often develops "skin transformation techniques" based on the inspiration collected in the game to make her appearance more gorgeous.</p>

    <p>Although the Bai Qiao now looks like a small immortal ship, it is actually a scabbard. There is a socket at the end of the immortal ship, and a sword can be inserted into it.</p>

    <p>This set of "Galaxy Magic Armor" skin was also inspired by Bai Qiao's recent play of auto chess. Even Bai Qiao himself did not expect that it would come in handy so quickly.</p>

    <p>Sit on the immortal ship. The leather sofa inside makes Sun Rong feel more comfortable: "Senior Bai Qiao is so amazing!"</p>

    <p>"You don't have to say that?" Bai Qiao said with some pride: "Now, let's go!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lord Ma's teleportation golden light fell from the sky on time, transporting everyone to a fixed point outside the secret realm of the Sword King Realm universe in the East District of the extraterrestrial Galaxy...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Wang Family Villa. Wang Ling felt Er Ha, Sun Rong, and Bai Qiao's breath disappear from the earth. They immediately knew that they had begun the recovery mission.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. Bai Qiao. Really. Can it be done?" Jingke couldn't help but ask from the side.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reached out and rubbed Jingke's soft white hair. He could actually feel Jingke's worry.</p>

    <p>Although the Sword King Realm is indeed his hometown, it is too chaotic. Since ancient times, countless spiritual swords have been bred from the Sword King Realm. From the moment they were born, they have been trying their best to escape from that place.</p>

    <p>Tens of trillions of spiritual swords have been struggling for thousands of years. They tried to break out. But in the end they faced failure and turned into sword tombs in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Jingke remembers that he broke through the Sword King Realm. It also took a long time?</p>

    <p>About a week?</p>

    <p>He used his sword energy to grind a gap and successfully escaped from the sword storm.</p>

    <p>And right behind him is "Yu"...</p>
