  <h1>Chapter 1355 Perfectly avoids all correct answers</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels that this may be the biggest blame he will bear in his life.</p>

    <p>I can only say that Mr. Boss Sun is worthy of being Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>This ability to avoid the correct answer...</p>

    <p>It turns out that you are the legendary "Obi Ultimate Mouri Kogoro!"</p>

    <p>At least Kogoro got it right sometimes. But Zhuo Yi discovered that the miraculous thing about Boss Sun is that he always seems to be able to perfectly avoid all the correct answers.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect it. Was it still discovered..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi held his chin with his fingers crossed. He leaned forward and propped his elbows on his knees, pretending to be thoughtful.</p>

    <p>The matter has come to this. It is impossible for him to deny it.</p>

    <p>Although this pot was extremely huge, he could only push it down until now.</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo, I still admitted it." Mr. Boss Sun looked like he was in control of the overall situation. He had absolute confidence. Let Zhuo Yi admit this matter, mainly because he had enough evidence at hand.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how Mr. Sun knew about this?" Zhuo Yi was very curious about this.</p>

    <p>"You and your classmate Wang have known each other for a long time. Maybe we met before the first spirit sword exchange meeting at Number 60 High School. I also asked Rongrong specifically about the events on the day of the spirit sword exchange meeting."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun began to make his own wonderful reasoning: "Rongrong said. During your solo spirit sword performance, you chose the peach wood sword of your classmate Wang at the first sight. This is actually a subconscious psychological move. It means The relationship between you is no small matter."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Is there any other evidence..."</p>

    <p>"Of course there are."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun nodded: "General Zhuo defeated the demon king Tuntian Ha back then. And now that toad has been turned into a dog. There are so many classmates in Number 60 High School. So why is this dog raised among classmates? Wang Ling's home? Obviously. This is a meeting gift you gave to your classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It's true that this toad is a demon king. But the person who defeated him back then was you, Director Zhuo. So it must be obedient to your words. You put it in the home of classmate Wang Ling. In fact, it was to protect classmate Wang Ling. Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun chuckled: "This master's care for his disciples is too obvious."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Zhuo Yi's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is really both wise and brave!"</p>

    <p>"Of course, there is decisive evidence in the end. It is the close visit to the home of classmate Wang Ling by the Zhuo Administration."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is following me?" Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"It's not tracking. It's just some technical means."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun said calmly: "The medal of the General Administration pinned on the chest of General Administration Zhuo actually has a positioning function. In the past time, your medal has been frequently located at the home of classmate Wang Ling Haunting. I'm afraid this has gone beyond the relationship between ordinary seniors and juniors, right?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but applaud: "As expected of Mr. Sun. Your reasoning ability is beyond comparison..."</p>

    <p>"They are all trivial tricks. I...</p>

    <p>Being able to sit in this position depends on his extraordinary reasoning ability." Boss Sun said this and couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>I used to make elixirs. Now I play stocks.</p>

    <p>Pills are considered a real industry. Now there are fully automated production machines. Except for rare pills, most pills can be fully automated through machines. There is not much manual technology content.</p>

    <p>So over time, Sun Yiyuan began to learn to analyze stocks.</p>

    <p>Or the stock market is exciting!</p>

    <p>Under his clear analysis every time, Huaguo Shuilian Group has also made a lot of money through stock operations in recent years.</p>

    <p>"If General Zhuo is interested, you can take my stock class. Of course, these are top-secret courses within the group."</p>

    <p>"Boss Mr. Sun still knows about stocks?"</p>

    <p>"It's just some trivial analysis. The specific person to control it is Jiang Xiaoche. He is the secretary beside me whom General Zhuo met before."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi is not 100% sure yet.</p>

    <p>But he can probably guess that Jiang Xiaoche probably bought it according to Boss Sun's words!</p>

    <p>Regarding this, Zhuo Yi couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p>

    <p>It is not easy for Huaguo Shuilian Group to become so big...</p>

    <p>He smiled bitterly and said: "Mr. Sun came to see me today to confirm his identity. But he wanted to inquire about my disciple...er."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said this bravely.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he groaned and shouted thousands of times in his heart. He hoped that Wang Ling would not blame him: "Master! I really didn't mean to take advantage of you! Your father-in-law has come to investigate! Is this the fault of this disciple?" I can't carry it!"</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was delighted when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He knew early on that Zhuo Yi was a decent person.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that he is deeply loved by Secretary Sun.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Yiyuan feels that even if he doesn't help Zhuo Yi get this vote, Zhuo Yi will be able to take the top spot in the league sooner or later with his own abilities.</p>

    <p>"I knew it. Chief Zhuo is a smart man."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun was extremely happy: "What I want to ask is not a big deal... I just want to ask about the interests and hobbies of classmate Wang Ling. Or the interests and hobbies of classmate Wang Ling's family."</p>

    <p>"Simply noodles." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"What?" Sun Yiyuan thought he heard wrongly.</p>

    <p>"It's just a little snack..."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun sighed: "No wonder my former classmate Wang went to the hospital to see how my Rongrong was doing. He didn't even take a look at the high-end snacks I had people prepare."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said with a smile: "But ordinary crispy noodles are now very difficult for my apprentice to detect."</p>

    <p>"This is easy. I can find someone to make it privately. Ask the best pastry chef in the world to make it fresh!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun is really generous. But if you really do this, it might make my apprentice disgusted..."</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun said: "Classmate Wang just likes to be low...</p>

    <p>Adjust it. I'll ask the ramen chef to appear next to him without anyone noticing."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan: "So. What do classmate Wang's parents like?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "My disciple's father is an online novelist."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I know this! Monthly tickets! Recommended votes! Rewards!"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun was excited: "What's the pen name? I can arrange it for him immediately!"</p>

    <p>"Pen name. Wang Situ."</p>

    <p>"It turns out Wang Situ is him..." Boss Sun was startled.</p>

    <p>Given his relationship with Head of State, he naturally knew that Head of State had been pursuing a novel written by a man named Wang Situ.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sun Yiyuan didn't expect that the world would be so small.</p>

    <p>This Wang Situ is actually the father of classmate Wang Ling...</p>
