  <h1>Chapter 1181 No holiday even on New Year's Eve</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The stalactite cave guarded by Huang Lao is divided into five major areas. After clearing the two brothers, Wang Zhen, Xiao Yin, and Er Ha successfully entered the stalactite cave inside. The moisture in the cave is very heavy, and there are constant water drops. It dripped from the stone pillar above.</p>

    <p>Water droplets exploded on Er Ha's green hair. The icy cold air penetrated into the body, causing all the hair on Er Ha's body to stand on end. This stalactite cave has a history of thousands of years. There are stalactites everywhere in the cave. With the breath of immortality.</p>

    <p>Some are like jade dragon teeth hanging upside down from the top to the ground, and some are like clouds and rain hanging from the sky. The white waves are rolling, which makes people wonder.</p>

    <p>Although such a place is beautiful, it is impossible to live for a long time. The cold air from the thousand-year stalactite cave will make the whole body full of yin energy. Unless it is assisted by extremely yang exercises, otherwise you will definitely suffer from various diseases here in the long run. Such wet disease.</p>

    <p>"I took a look at Mr. Huang from a distance before. What Mr. Huang practiced was definitely not a technique with extremely yang attributes." After going deep into the stalactite cave, Wang Zhen's doubts about Mr. Huang couldn't help but become deeper.</p>

    <p>The so-called Extreme Yang Kung Fu. Wang Zhen was once fortunate enough to see a technique that could infuse the power of the sun into the body through Qigong. Finally, it was possible to achieve the perfect fusion of the sun and spiritual energy, allowing for free manipulation.</p>

    <p>When the skill is activated, it combines the power of the sun, spiritual energy, and blood energy. The energy of the three different powers will be tightly entwined like a twist. When the last punch is punched out, the fist will emit a dazzling light like the sun.</p>

    <p>That kind of skill is called {Sun Wave}. Wang Zhen only saw it once in his lifetime. And the boxing master who understood this skill is in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>His name is Apollo. He is a fair-skinned man covered in pitch black who likes to apply olive oil all over his body. After practicing {solar wave}, his whole body is shining with golden light. His whole body exudes a golden aura.</p>

    <p>But now there is no war in the God's Domain. Apollo, who has practiced {solar wave}, is indeed very strong. But because there is no war, he is now a traffic policeman on night duty in the God's Domain... responsible for maintaining the order of the God's Domain at night.</p>

    <p>"Aren't there any more high-end jobs in your divine domain..."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Apollo also works part-time as a power bank sharer. If I have the opportunity, I will introduce you to him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Let's get back to the subject. The doubt raised by Wang Zhen is about Huang Lao's true identity. It is simply unrealistic to live in such a yin place for a long time without any yang skills...</p>

    <p>In the chat channel, Xiao Yin and Er Ha. also showed incredible expressions after hearing the news.</p>

    <p>"You mean... Mr. Huang in the command center is... fake?"</p>

    <p>"It's just my current guess. Because there is no concrete evidence. Since the other party can make such a perfect disguise and even deceive President Qi, one of the ten generals, he must have his own unique method."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt that what was going on behind the scenes would never be so simple. There must be some little-known secrets inside. He knew that Mr. Huang was President Qi's master. The master and the disciple knew everything about him. If this was a fake Mr. Huang. With President Qi It's impossible to be unaware of Qi's abilities.</p>

    <p>The more he investigates this matter, the more Wang Zhen feels that there is a mystery and evil behind the whole incident. A mysterious person behind the scenes who has not been revealed so far. A fake person who even President Qi, his own disciple, cannot distinguish between the authenticity and the fake one. Huang Lao...</p>

    <p>How many hidden methods does the other party have?</p>

    <p>Using his perception ability to detect the entire stalactite cave, Wang Zhen suddenly felt that his spirit was greatly shaken.</p>

    <p>In the fourth and fifth areas of the stalactite cave, he could clearly feel that his perception was blocked by a mysterious force. The sea of spiritual consciousness fell into darkness for a moment. What happened? Can't see it anymore.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to come here. I told you that the three Menshi brothers are useless. Your Majesty, I still don't believe it." A familiar voice came from the darkness. It was a feminine voice. There was something in it. Very spicy taste.</p>

    <p>Er Ha controls his dog hair. The green hair on his head bursts out with bright green light, illuminating the front instantly... This is Er Ha's new ability after evolving into a human form. He can use the fluorescence of his dog form to Adjust the color of dog hair to increase the brightness. Then put it out in this form.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was shocked by this new ability. Because even he was seeing it for the first time...</p>

    <p>Since when are there still green-haired players in the Super League?</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Since I evolved into human form, my newly acquired abilities are still being gradually developed. There are still many things you don't know, so don't be too surprised. These are basic operations."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin, Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>With the illumination of Er Ha's green light, everyone finally saw clearly the appearance of the person coming in the darkness.</p>

    <p>This is a woman with excellent body proportions. She has long flowing hair, slender eyes, and a straight nose. She is wearing a black and red corset. Her face is covered with thick makeup.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha saw this person for the first time, he felt that his appearance was somewhat familiar.</p>

    <p>However, when his eyes moved to the woman's breasts, Er Ha couldn't move his eyes away for an instant: "This is... this is 36D!"</p>

    <p>The reason why he is so familiar with this size is not because Er Ha has become interested in human women. The main reason is because he has an indissoluble bond with 36D...</p>

    <p>"Shadow Stream." Er Ha stared at the woman in front of him and made his own guess. At the same time, his eyes were extremely alert.</p>

    <p>The Lord of Shadow Stream should have been captured by now. He is being held under high security by Warden Liang in the Number 1 Prison of Songhai City. Logically speaking, it is impossible for him to appear here.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Liuyue sisters had a history of escaping from prison before, which led Liang Yuchang to raise their level of imprisonment to the highest level in the scope of crime. Second only to the Mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I am Shadow Liu." However, what surprised Er Ha was that the woman in front of him quickly admitted her identity.</p>

    <p>She grinned and showed a sinister smile: "When I recovered, I knew that Shadow Stream had disappeared. Those two sisters were really useless. They destroyed the foundation I left behind. Shadow Stream was supposed to be the world's leader. The most powerful killer organization...unexpectedly, it was ultimately defeated by my two apprentices."</p>

    <p>"Jiang Liuying, Jiang Liuyue...are all your apprentices?" Er Ha suddenly realized. It felt like all the clues became clear in an instant.</p>

    <p>"Does all this still matter?"</p>

    <p>The woman smiled: "The shadow stream of the past no longer exists... now... is a new beginning."</p>

    <p>She took a step forward and immediately took out a sharp dagger from her slender thigh: "I am not the Lord of Shadow Stream. I am the ancestor of Shadow Stream. The third epic killer on the legendary killer list..."</p>
