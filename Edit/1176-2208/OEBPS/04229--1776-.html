  <h1>Chapter 1776 Blood Lotus Female Butcher</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This headbutt fell from the sky. The disguised sword energy of the nine-core Aohai really hit the old man's lower back like a meteorite. The old man felt a huge shock to his internal organs on the spot.</p>

    <p>In the ranks of the Eternal Ones, he is known as Haiyao Jushi. Although he came to help under instructions this time, he never expected that there would be another master with strength beyond the earth level.</p>

    <p>"There is a master here..." The old man, known as Haiyao Jushi, wiped the blue blood flowing from the corner of his mouth. He had no defense against the blow just now. But fortunately, he had a method to protect him. He looked very injured. In fact, it is not difficult to recover.</p>

    <p>He stared at the mysterious woman wearing a nine-tailed fox mask who fell from the sky in front of him, showing a rare expression of excitement. He is a famous martial arts fanatic. In his opinion, the overall level of cultivators on the earth is really weak.</p>

    <p>Fighting against this group of people is like the bright moon versus ants. And now...the appearance of this mysterious woman has completely aroused his curiosity.</p>

    <p>"Senior, this person is the Wang Piaoliang mentioned in the previous information." At this time, a member of the Tengu echoed.</p>

    <p>"So it's her." Master Haiyao Jushi heard this and nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>Before today's action, he had heard that there was a peerless master named "Wang Piaoliang" in the Office of Strategic Deception. But he didn't expect to meet her so soon.</p>

    <p>According to the instructions left to him by the employer behind the scenes, if he encounters this Wang Piaoliang, he can not follow the rules and be executed on the spot.</p>

    <p>He is a veritable Haiyao Jushi. As long as there is a sea, he is invincible!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next second, Sun Rong immediately felt that the lion head and fish tail behind the old man in front of him became terrifying. It expanded instantly and became taller. It was like a mountain, giving people a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>At the same time, there was a strange sound from all directions. It had some kind of incomprehensible sound of the great way. It was extremely complicated and mysterious.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong reacted, she found that the surrounding environment had changed. The troops on the island headed by Li Wei and the group of tengu brought by Master Haiyao Jushi were gone.</p>

    <p>Some are just accompanied by screams like sea monsters roaring all around. The purple water is constantly lapping at the shore. Even the sky is rendered purple.</p>

    <p>"Core World?"</p>

    <p>This is not the first time Sun Rong has entered someone else's core world. She soon realized that Haiyao Jushi in front of her had already set up a battlefield and planned to show off his skills here.</p>

    <p>His aura was very strong. It was more than hundreds of times stronger than before. There was a strange feeling all over her body.</p>

    <p>This is deliberately releasing spiritual pressure on Sun Rong. In addition to deterring, it is also testing Sun Rong's background.</p>

    <p>And when Haiyao Jushi found that his temptation had no effect at all, he was shocked: "In my core world, you can still move? Tell me your name..."</p>

    <p>As an eternal being, an existence that can look down upon the world forever. How many people on earth can withstand such spiritual pressure?</p>

    <p>It would be impossible for an ordinary cultivator on earth to do it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sir Haiyao Jushi concluded that the Wang Piaoliang in front of him must also be an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>"What benefit did the person behind you give you?" Sun Rong held the disguised red Aohai. She was not in a hurry to take action. She instinctively wanted to extract some information.</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi looked at Sun Rong's sword. At the same time, he was also guessing about Sun Rong's identity.</p>

    <p>A Sword master holding a red sword...</p>

    <p>He immediately thought of someone in his mind.</p>

    <p>"It turns out it was you..."</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi looked at Sun Rong. He took off his mask, revealing his old face with completely droopy skin. He had an expression that already knew everything: "Even if you don't want to take off your mask, I know it's you. Blood Lotus Female Butcher."</p>

    <p>Blood Lotus Female Butcher?</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Sun Rong's expression was a bit confused.</p>

    <p>It's not just Sun Rong. Even Wang Ling's expression when watching the battle remotely is a bit blurry.</p>

    <p>Because most of the Eternals are contained in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>The Blood Lotus Female Butcher mentioned by Haiyao Jushi is indeed consistent with the characteristics of holding a red sword and being a Sword master.</p>

    <p>But now. The Blood Lotus Female Butcher is locked up in his Supreme Corpse Map...Wang Ling didn't expect that Haiyao Jushi would complete the brainstorming directly at the scene of the duel with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"You got the wrong person. I'm not."</p>

    <p>The first time. Sun Rong naturally denied this identity.</p>

    <p>Blood Lotus Female Butcher.</p>

    <p>This name was really unpleasant. She couldn't accept it.</p>

    <p>"No one can pretend in front of me. Although I have never met you, I am sure that you are the Blood Lotus Female Butcher. I wanted to avenge my brother, so I have been looking for you for a long time. I didn't expect you to join me in the form of Wang Piaoliang. In a small sect on earth."</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi sneered: "Just in time. Today, the great revenge will be avenged. I will kill you with my own hands. To avenge my dead brother..."</p>

    <p>"I'll say it again. I'm really not the Blood Lotus Female Butcher..."</p>

    <p>"The Blood Lotus Female Butcher loves to attack people's waists, especially men's waists. No matter how hard the holy body is, it can be pierced with one sword."</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi laughed and said, "My brother died in your hands! You can't even think of leaving here today!"</p>

    <p>At this point, the old man's expression turned completely crazy.</p>

    <p>He takes action.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>In an instant, a gap opened in his belly. An eternal iron chain anchor was directly pulled out of his body and flew into the sky!</p>

    <p>In the distance, Wang Muyu was so nervous that he pinched the corners of Wang Ling's clothes. The speed of this eternal anchor was too fast. It distorted the void. It deformed everything at the moment of traveling. It was so fast that it surpassed an incomprehensible limit.</p>

    <p>This is not a magic weapon. It is refined from the organs in the old man's body.</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi is one of the most demonic people in all eternity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has just received news from Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. Both of them claimed that this Haiyao Jushi has strange ways and is a unique existence among the eternal beings.</p>

    <p>But one thing is strange. That is that it is basically impossible for such a maverick person to become someone's subordinate. It is even less likely to be hired by anyone.</p>

    <p>So now even Wang Ling is very curious. What benefits did the person standing behind Lord Haiyao Jushi give this person?</p>

    <p>This eternal anchor came through the sky. It was aimed at Sun Rong. It was full of murderous intent.</p>

    <p>It seems cumbersome, but in fact it has its own spirituality. Ordinary avoidance will not work, because the anchor will automatically turn and lock the enemy.</p>

    <p>Even if she holds the nine-core Aohai, Sun Rong never dares to be careless. Although she has gone through several battles, it is still impossible to surpass these ancients in a short period of time in terms of combat experience.</p>

    <p>At this time, her dress was fluttering, and three red sword auras disguised as Aohai appeared outside her body. She was cautious as she moved, aiming at the anchor and preparing to attack.</p>

    <p>As a result, before the anchor even touched her body, the sword energy lingering outside her body had neatly cut it into tens of thousands of tofu pieces...</p>
