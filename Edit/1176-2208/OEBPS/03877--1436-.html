  <h1>Chapter 1436 Prediction of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Curly hair?</p>

    <p>Quite a good experience.</p>

    <p>After a cannon version of the Galaxy Fist, Wang Ling's hair became curly, with a very natural curvature.</p>

    <p>And this kind of curl should be able to maintain Wang Ling for a while.</p>

    <p>After all, this was a blow that Peng Xiren fired after thirty minutes of charging.</p>

    <p>If it returns to the normal hairstyle within a few seconds after changing the curls, it would be really disrespectful to Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>At least, the accumulated energy of Galaxy Fist made my hair curly.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, Peng Xiren's power is not too bad.</p>

    <p>But if you want to kill yourself, I'm afraid you still need some heat...</p>

    <p>At this time, when he looked at Peng Xiren again, he saw that Peng Xiren's nervous expression changed.</p>

    <p>It was pale at first, but now it has turned purple.</p>

    <p>His face was full of doubts that were beyond comprehension: "You... what state are you in..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he doesn't even know.</p>

    <p>The title Immortal King is quite good. It's just what the monk said.</p>

    <p>What is the realm after the ancestral realm? There is currently no clear concept.</p>

    <p>Back then, on the Nine Stars where the Divine Realm was located, Dao Ancestor Wang, the founder of the Nine Stars, was also called the "immortal king" by some people. However, this title seemed too big. Dao Ancestor Wang did not accept it.</p>

    <p>And now. This problem has fallen back to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So. Is he worthy?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that maybe he also lacks some warmth.</p>

    <p>"What is the relationship between you and my master..." Peng Xiren stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The last person who made him feel so oppressed was his master, Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>"Xingren. You know it well. There is no connection between Ling Zhenren and Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk interjected: "At first, the poor monk was also suspicious. But later I found that the difference between them is still very obvious..."</p>

    <p>This is a relatively euphemistic way of saying it.</p>

    <p>Obvious difference. The most direct point is of course reflected in the power gap.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. Dao Ancestor Wang's painstaking creation. Just put it in Wang Ling's hand and just pinch it...</p>

    <p>This gap is too big. It is separated by hundreds of millions of Mariana Trench. It is impossible to cross.</p>

    <p>In addition, the most obvious point, which is also the point just revealed, is the problem of Wang Ling's own Dharma.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang's dharma. It's a spirit called "Xie." The head has two legs. Its wings are broad. Normally, it is in human form. It wears metal armor engraved with the Heavenly Dao symbol. The sky and the earth. Hundreds of millions of feet tall.</p>

    <p>The monk has only been seen once before.</p>

    <p>It gave Monk Jin Deng a great shock at that time.</p>

    <p>However, the bigger the Dharma appears, the stronger it is.</p>

    <p>So. For the Dharma of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then there is no need to talk more...</p>

    <p>The spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>It was just an outline that looked like a human figure. You couldn't even see the face clearly. But the sense of oppression was just from a distance. It already made people kneel down and surrender.</p>

    <p>This is a powerful creature that claims to be the center of the universe.</p>

    <p>Controls the entire universe. The existence of the spirits of all planets!</p>

    <p>At this time, I heard Monk Jin Deng's voice of great surprise. Wang Ling looked at him and asked secretly: "So. Is it very strong?"</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng: "Of course..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Oh..."</p>

    <p>In fact, if the monk and Peng Xiren were not secretly shocked in their hearts, Wang Ling would not have known that his dharma form was the spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>This is really the first time Wang Ling has heard of it.</p>

    <p>Previously, he saw other people's Dharma forms. They were big and powerful. His own Dharma form... was a human-shaped creature. Wang Ling felt that he was still a little unable to handle it.</p>

    <p>The result is today. The truth has finally been revealed.</p>

    <p>So the current scene is.</p>

    <p>All three of them were shocked inside.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was shocked that he didn't know the origin of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The monk was shocked that Wang Ling knew nothing about his Dharma.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling was shocked that the Dharma image that he had always regarded as unremarkable was actually so powerful...</p>

    <p>"What the hell is going on with this person..." And now, Peng Xiren saw Wang Ling's expression of sudden realization, as if he had just learned what the spirit of the universe was. There was nothing but horror on his face. In addition to confusion, the corners of his mouth were also twitching constantly.</p>

    <p>Is this the legendary strong man?</p>

    <p>So strong that you don't even know how strong you are?</p>

    <p>Not much nonsense. When Wang Ling raised his hand towards Peng Xiren, the mole at the corner of his eye had disappeared.</p>

    <p>He took the initiative to take back his Dharma image.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I was worried that I would accidentally beat Peng Xiren to death.</p>

    <p>To deal with Peng Xiren. He still doesn't have the power to activate the Dharma.</p>

    <p>When he saw Wang Ling raising his arms towards him, Peng Xiren was also frightened; "If I die, I will drag you to death!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Actually, there are many things I want to ask Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>I have no intention of directly erasing him.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>If he wants to, he can do it anytime.</p>

    <p>"Maybe you're not afraid of me. But you can't protect everyone around you..." At this time, Peng Xiren stared at Wang Ling. His mind was running at high speed, and he was constantly brewing quarrels.</p>

    <p>The monk knows. This is deliberately delaying time.</p>

    <p>And soon. Peng Xiren's actions verified the monk's idea.</p>

    <p>"Winning or losing the battle between me and you is not the key." The next moment, Peng Xiren's expression suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>Because I got the Rubik's Cube!</p>

    <p>Just when he was fighting the monk, Peng Xiren secretly created a clone and went to the earth to take away the Rubik's Cube!</p>

    <p>He was secretly happy.</p>

    <p>Because this Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube actually looks new! It's almost like new!</p>

    <p>The monk gritted his teeth and said, "Do you know what you are doing... If you release the sealed person, you will definitely be doomed!"</p>

    <p>"I know very well what I am doing. And after this test, I have a deeper understanding of you and Wang Ling's strength. If there is the power of the sealed person, we will join forces. Combat strength Maybe it's even. Maybe it can even overflow?" Peng Xiren curled his lips.</p>

    <p>Then, his figure began to fade away.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling pretended to be panicked and quickly reached out to grab it.</p>

    <p>The five fingers that covered the sky covered it. When he took the photo, Peng Xiren's entire body had turned into a ball of light particles. It looked like it had decomposed.</p>

    <p>In the vast universe, only Peng Xiren's last words are left: "You are very strong. But you lack experience in martial arts. Your reaction is too slow. My body can dissipate under the starlight. No one in the universe can catch me." ..See you next time!"</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling took back his hand.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was very calm.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren deliberately spared his life. He also pretended to make a mistake and failed to catch him. It seems that the fish has been hooked. The monk bowed to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He chuckled inwardly, feeling that Peng Xiren would lose to his own cleverness sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren acts cunningly. When he used the cannon version of Galaxy Fist, Wang Ling had already noticed that he sent another clone to the earth to steal the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren predicts. Wang Ling and the monk will focus all their energy on the current battle and will not worry about other things.</p>

    <p>Finally, the Rubik's Cube was taken away smoothly.</p>

    <p>But what he didn't expect was that asking Peng Xiren to take the Rubik's Cube back was a part of the king's secret.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. Predicted his prediction.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren. Peng Xiren has a deceitful mind. If he doesn't catch up immediately, I'm afraid he will be able to tell that the Rubik's Cube has changed..." At this time, the monk said from the side.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>Next, it's time to continue to improve your acting skills...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren claims that no one in the universe can catch him.</p>

    <p>For such confidence. Wang Ling can only smile.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling didn't set off immediately is not because we really can't catch Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>But I feel that Peng Xiren moves too slowly.</p>

    <p>Let him run away for a while on purpose...</p>
