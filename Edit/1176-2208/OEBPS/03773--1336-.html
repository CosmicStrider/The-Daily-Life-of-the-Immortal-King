  <h1>Chapter 1336 Wang Ying's Training</h1>

  <div>

    <p>An astonishing scene. Everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception was stunned and speechless.</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi opened her mouth in shock.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought.</p>

    <p>It turns out that "the sky is dyed with my blood" actually means this!</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Miss Ajuan has made a great contribution.</p>

    <p>She successfully withstood the world-destroying artillery bombardment from the void by using a cell phone film that had been blessed by a monk and whose power was greatly increased in a short period of time under the influence of the "Enlightenment Technique!"</p>

    <p>"This is impossible!" Sun Ying'er screamed.</p>

    <p>She held her head. The collapsed look was very much like the groundhog before.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er can't accept it!</p>

    <p>My plan to take away Sun Rong was actually stopped by this mere cell phone film!</p>

    <p>"It's you..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er lowered his head and stared at the man who stood up again on the ground.</p>

    <p>She was 100% sure that this matter was related to the "real clone" in front of her!</p>

    <p>"It's just a clone! I will destroy you now!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er became angry and swooped down from the void.</p>

    <p>Her long white hair was completely spread out, like a witch falling from the sky!</p>

    <p>The ghostly figure carried an unimaginable agility. It flashed very close to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand. He raised his orchid finger and aimed it at Sun Ying'er's head.</p>

    <p>A huge force. Sun Ying'er was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Crack!"</p>

    <p>The skull was shattered on the spot. Sun Ying'er screamed.</p>

    <p>The astonishing ejection force made her whole body on the spot like a cannonball rising from the ground. She shot backwards! It was fierce and domineering. It shook the world...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling left some finger strength.</p>

    <p>Just calculate the direction of Sun Ying'er's ejection to ensure that Sun Ying'er's body will accurately take off from the earth and land next to Wang Ying who is waiting for him in space.</p>

    <p>It's better to leave the matter to Shadow.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if it weren't for Wang Ying's sake.</p>

    <p>With that shot just now, Sun Ying'er had already been completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of Wang Ling, there was no suspense about this battle from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Over there is the unspeakable land.</p>

    <p>I think the monk has almost finished cleaning up.</p>

    <p>It's time to change your soul back</p>

    <p>"Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Lord!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the familiar voice of Sun Rong sounded from behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She had gone through a battle. The girl's jade-like face was covered with a little dust from the aftermath of the battle.</p>

    <p>She ran over a little embarrassed. She walked up to him openly and smiled as happily as a child: "I know. You will definitely stand up! You are the clone of classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>He has obviously returned to his physical body, but he has not lost his memory...</p>

    <p>Is it because the obsession is too strong that it causes delayed amnesia?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips moved slightly.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>He knew that the girl had said it and would try hard not to forget it.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it actually happened.</p>

    <p>Delayed amnesia is a very rare phenomenon.</p>

    <p>People with delayed amnesia will gradually lose their memory in the soul state after a few hours.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling suddenly came back to his senses.</p>

    <p>He felt a tangy, sweet aroma.</p>

    <p>Only then did he realize that he and the girl were very close to each other.</p>

    <p>Subconsciously I want to retreat.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Sun Rong's hand suddenly stretched out: "Senior, don't move!"</p>

    <p>I saw the girl gently brushing his cheek with her thin and long fingers, and pinching off a petal that had been pierced into his cheek.</p>

    <p>This was left behind when Crispy Noodles Dao Lord fought Sun Ying'er previously.</p>

    <p>The petals are deeply rooted.</p>

    <p>The edges are slightly inset.</p>

    <p>Seeing the wound, the girl felt a little sorry.</p>

    <p>"My shadow... actually caused so much trouble to senior..."</p>

    <p>Then, her behavior became even bolder.</p>

    <p>The girl began to gently touch the wound on her cheek with her fingertips. Blue spiritual power lit up from her fingertips and poured into the wound gently.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong tried to use Aohai's recovery ability to repair the wound.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Crispy Noodles Dao Lord in front of him seemed to suddenly wake up.</p>

    <p>Gently grasp Sun Rong's hand. He gently removes his hand. He still has that heart-warming smile like the spring breeze blowing on his face: "Thank you, Miss Sun, for your kindness. I'm fine."</p>

    <p>"Hey, senior. Are you really okay?" Sun Rong asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"It's OK."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord smiled and said: "Miss Sun, you win."</p>

    <p>"I... won?"</p>

    <p>"You win."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord nodded: "Remember the face pinching contest?"</p>

    <p>Reminiscent of the abnormal reaction that appeared on Crispy Noodles Dao Lord earlier. Sun Rong suddenly came to his senses.</p>

    <p>"It turns out... what I just pinched was..."</p>

    <p>The girl shyly knelt down on the spot and buried her face deeply in her knees.</p>

    <p>I was shy and wanted to find a hole in the ground to crawl into.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>An unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling soul returns to its original body.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren?Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Seeing that You Meng was no longer bleeding. The monk confirmed that the real Wang Ling had returned.</p>

    <p>But he called several times in succession.</p>

    <p>But I saw that the young man seemed to be frozen in place. There was no movement for a long time.</p>

    <p>Huh? Zhenren is in a daze? It's been a long time since I've seen him...</p>

    <p>The monk was amazed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just now. Too close.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can even clearly feel the girl's breath.</p>

    <p>He reached out and gently touched his cheek.</p>

    <p>It's obvious that the body has been replaced.</p>

    <p>On the cheek. The area being touched.</p>

    <p>The temperature there.</p>

    <p>It seems that it still hasn't dispersed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the universe, Sun Ying'er, who was bounced back to Wang Ying, immediately received a new round of "training."</p>

    <p>"I told you woman. You're playing with fire."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying pinched Sun Ying'er's chin and sneered.</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do..."</p>

    <p>The expression on Sun Ying'er's face gradually turned to panic.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's finger flick made her fly very far.</p>

    <p>In the process of flying, Sun Ying'er also completely understood the gap in absolute power.</p>

    <p>She thought everything was according to her plan.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect the world-destroying bombardment he had painstakingly prepared.</p>

    <p>Not as strong as that enhanced mobile phone film...</p>

    <p>At this moment</p>

    <p>She even noticed it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's madness...</p>

    <p>God knows a young man who has always been silent.</p>

    <p>Why does it give birth to such a crazy shadow!</p>

    <p>Wang Ying pinched her chin. The expression on her face showed a fierce look.</p>

    <p>To be honest, the more scared Sun Ying'er was, the more excited Wang Ying felt.</p>

    <p>"Can't you split? I can split as much as you split... No matter where you escape, I can catch you back!" Wang Ying firmly grasped the white-haired girl's wrist. It was almost like The laughter overflowing from the bottom of his heart made Sun Ying'er feel scared from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>This is the real smile hiding a knife.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er thought that his level was already very high.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect to see Wang Ying now. Only then did I realize that I was dwarfed by a big witch!</p>

    <p>"Why. My Shadow ability doesn't work at all in front of you!" Sun Ying'er shouted.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Sun Ying'er also discovered that the memories of the split bodies seemed to be unable to be shared!</p>

    <p>The information could not be transmitted to the main body in time. This was one of the reasons why Sun Ying'er failed in this battle.</p>

    <p>Of course, it is impossible for Wang Ying to say that Wang Nuan gave him permission.</p>

    <p>"Your female. I'm a male! When a female sees a male, it won't work anymore! This is called. One thing brings down another thing!"</p>

    <p>The corners of his lips couldn't help but rise.</p>

    <p>"Don't go too far!" Sun Ying'er struggled hard, trying to get rid of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"There are even worse ones!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying stared at Sun Ying'er. He smiled evilly.</p>

    <p>"You... what are you doing... you pervert!" Sun Ying'er was almost crying.</p>

    <p>"Men should be perverted. What's wrong with that!"</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ying stretched out another hand, grabbed the girl's other wrist, and suddenly raised it above her head.</p>

    <p>His eyes wandered around and he chose the nearest planet.</p>

    <p>He pressed the girl down and slammed forward!</p>

    <p>"This... what kind of spell is this..."</p>

    <p>"Ha. Woman! Never seen her before, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying sneered: "This is the legendary {Planet thumping technique}!"</p>

    <p>He grabbed her wrist tightly and crashed towards an orange planet!</p>

    <p>The two of them fell. The Rushen star descended from the sky, taking her with it and blasting through the star core!</p>

    <p>"No. This planet is too fragile. Find another one!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying hadn't had enough fun yet. He grabbed Sun Ying'er's hand and hit the second one...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Ying'er's tears have burst into tears: "You... let me go!!!"</p>
