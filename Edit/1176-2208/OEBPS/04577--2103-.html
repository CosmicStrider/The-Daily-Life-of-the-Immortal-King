  <h1>Chapter 2103 The correct way to open Heavenly Dao cloud</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The art of building walls. This is one of Mi Xiu's usual operations. Over the past hundreds of years, the superior Yuan Zun in Mi Xiu and his staff have secretly used this method to deceive many local monks.</p>

    <p>In the context of the modern era of self-cultivation, it is almost difficult for a hot war between a self-cultivation country and a self-cultivation country to occur. Interests always come first. As long as one's own strategic security is guaranteed, the major self-cultivation countries will be attacked. To start a war easily is tantamount to self-destruction.</p>

    <p>In today's world of cultivation, only Mi Xiu hopes that the whole world can fight.</p>

    <p>As a country of cultivation that has made a lot of money through war and invasion, Mixiu's local spirit stone reserves have always been ranked first in the world. Not only that, the exchange rate of rice currency is also very high. This is the capital that they can show off to the outside world for a long time.</p>

    <p>But this time, Michu finally shot himself in the foot.</p>

    <p>"It's obvious that Qiao Yanyuan has a profit-driven relationship with Mi XiuYuan Zun. They blocked the sea area. In the final analysis, the brothers and sisters are still trying to stir up trouble."</p>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base. Shou Chong made his own analysis: "According to Mi Xiu Yuan Zun's original plan, they drove the immortal fleet to surround Xiao Bai Long. This is to express their position."</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin immediately nodded: "According to past experience, those cultivating countries that particularly like to follow Mi Xiu and take sides should also follow suit in this case. At least they will make their voices heard on the Internet to choose sides. That's right. But this time, no cultivation country came forward..."</p>

    <p>"Those who have attained the truth will receive many help, while those who have lost the path will receive little help. This itself is the most sacred truth in our ancient civilization of Huaxiu. Of course, on this basis, there is another truth. That is the fist. It is technology." Shou Chong He said with a solemn expression.</p>

    <p>When he saw that Mi Xiu was defeated this time, he naturally felt a strong feeling of anger in his heart. Even they would not have thought that the world structure today has changed.</p>

    <p>Especially for Huaxiu, who already possesses the two latest cultivation technologies, "Ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device" and "Pure Mechanized Monk." If other cultivation countries dare to stand aside easily, they must undoubtedly ask themselves Will it be able to withstand the pressure in the future?</p>

    <p>Obviously, all the major cultivation countries in the world are very quiet today. No leader in any country is willing to take this unknown risk.</p>

    <p>This is a smart approach.</p>

    <p>Even if you don't immediately publicly support Huaxiu, at least stand as a bystander and remain neutral. This is not difficult, right?</p>

    <p>But in the past, even some neutral cultivating countries would rebel. It was obviously a neutral cultivating country, but it could freeze all the spiritual stones stored here in other cultivating countries.</p>

    <p>Is there any royal law? Is there any law...</p>

    <p>Now Mi Xiu was really panicking. Because they found that during the whole confrontation, all the "followers" in the past were gone. Without any support from the Internet, the wall of spiritual consciousness was almost immediately thrown in. strategically used.</p>

    <p>Paralyzing the consciousness of one's own local monks and adapting a new story is the greatest function of the wall of spiritual consciousness.</p>

    <p>This is not unique to Mi Xiu. Nan Han has also done similar things. And to this day...this wall of spiritual consciousness still exists.</p>

    <p>In order to make the local monks have stronger self-confidence, Nanhan built the wall of spiritual consciousness. It changed the local monks' understanding of the world. They believed that everything in this world was invented by them. It is even possible that the birth of the universe was. Can't live without Nanhan...</p>

    <p>In essence, this is a means of self-deception. The establishment of the wall of spiritual consciousness needs to be driven by the formation. Then it accurately covers the spiritual consciousness of all monks in a limited area through a method of energy radiation. Then it uses the means of modern cultivation science. Accurately identify each person's spiritual consciousness for precise manipulation.</p>

    <p>The lower the realm of monks, the more likely they are to be affected. So in fact, the wall of spiritual consciousness cannot control all monks. Most of the powerful people hiding behind the scenes are still clear-headed.</p>

    <p>Some people will even stand up and tell the truth.</p>

    <p>However, when everyone around you is deceived, if you jump out in this situation, others will only regard you as the most unusual lunatic...</p>

    <p>"Is there any way to break through the wall?" Zhai Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. But it's very troublesome."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said: "Teacher Wang Ming now has a divine brain. It is relatively easy to control ten thousand mechanical monks. In the final analysis, these mechanical monks are just preset programs. At best, they are complex codes. He can fully bear it alone. But To break through the wall of spiritual consciousness, you must intervene forcefully and change the perceptions of so many monks in a country of cultivation."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>A monk who cultivates the country. That number is hundreds of millions!</p>

    <p>It is not on the scale of ten thousand mechanical monks. And monks are different from mechanical monks. They have their own thoughts and wisdom. If you want to fundamentally change them, you still have to span such a long distance. I don't think it is an easy task.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the basis for building the wall of spiritual consciousness is a huge circle of magic circles. These magic circles are usually set up at the borders of the country of cultivation. They are like making dumplings and can include all the local monks.</p>

    <p>To build a wall of spiritual consciousness, there must be tens of thousands of giant magic circles like this!</p>

    <p>In fact, the most direct way to destroy the wall of spiritual consciousness is to directly destroy these magic circles. But the location of the magic circle is usually top secret. And the wall of spiritual consciousness must be completely destroyed. At least half of the relevant magic circles must be destroyed.</p>

    <p>They cannot do this directly. It is easy for anyone on the Wang Ling side to destroy the magic circle. But it is easy to get caught. Instead, they will fall into Michu's trap.</p>

    <p>Secondly, these giant magic circles built based on the wall of spiritual consciousness are directly connected with the local monks in Michu to form an extremely complex circuit diagram. Even if you want to destroy the magic circle, you must be cautious, because once the magic circle is destroyed Forced destruction. General and harmonization may affect the original intelligence of some monks.</p>

    <p>"This won't work and that won't work either. What should we do?" Zhai Yin sighed. She felt that this matter was very complicated and not so easy to solve.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming and Shou Chong obviously had a new trick. The two looked at each other, then looked at each other. They said in unison: "There is a way! We have Heavenly Dao Cloud!"</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao Yun?" Zhai Yin was stunned: "This is not the miracle of the universe that was just conquered by Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"It has been there a long time ago. But it has never taken action. Heavenly Dao Yun itself is a derivative miracle of the will of the universe. It is the embodiment of the will of the universe...With its help, it may be able to easily crack the wall of spiritual consciousness and restore those local monks. Not to mention the cognition. It will not have any adverse effects."</p>

    <p>"How can I help?" Zhai Yin was curious.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple." Wang Ming said at this time: "Let it handle all the affected monk data directly. To put it simply, let it be my cloud disk."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>
