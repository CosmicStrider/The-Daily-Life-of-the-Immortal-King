  <h1>Chapter 1358 Super Sword Spirit Container</h1>

  <div>

    <p>I can only say that the monk deserves to be a monk.</p>

    <p>There is a profound meaning in the words of the monks. It is true that ordinary people cannot understand it.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that if even the monks were to behave themselves these days, I'm afraid no one else would have anything to do with it.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun's face is so red..."</p>

    <p>The monk felt that the girl might have thought of something strange.</p>

    <p>He can actually read minds. But for the girl in front of him, the monk felt that he had to pay enough respect.</p>

    <p>It is impolite to read people's minds at will.</p>

    <p>But this directly led to it. When the monk faced Sun Rong, he actually couldn't really understand Sun Rong's true thoughts.</p>

    <p>The problem can only be solved by guessing.</p>

    <p>"What the poor monk means is that after this incident, Miss Sun has learned to protect herself. In fact, the auxiliary magic weapon that the poor monk mentioned is not specifically for the waist. Other parts can also be relieved." The monk said.</p>

    <p>"I see. Rongrong doesn't seem to like this very much! Isn't the best protection the attack? Why don't monks help Rongrong upgrade his spirit sword?" At this time, Sun Ying'er on the side came up with a new idea.</p>

    <p>"Upgrade the spirit sword?" The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>This is a good choice.</p>

    <p>"Master. This is my sword."</p>

    <p>The next moment. Sun Rong opened her hand. A blue aura spewed out from her palm.</p>

    <p>She summoned Aohai.</p>

    <p>After the last battle at Jiulong Mountain, the Aohai girl group Sun Rong suffered heavy losses. Although the group has spent a lot of money on cloning, it will take a long time to restore the original 48 Aohai.</p>

    <p>"Use the technology of cloning the spirit sword to realize the linkage between sword and spirit on the basis of the main body..."</p>

    <p>The monk saw the secret hidden in Aohai at a glance.</p>

    <p>Doing so can indeed greatly increase combat power. However, it will also place a huge burden on the girl's body.</p>

    <p>Controlling so many spiritual swords will greatly test the spiritual power and spiritual power of the original owner of the spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>Just like a computer running multiple programs at the same time has an overheating reaction. Over time, it may even cause irreversible damage to the body.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, from now on, it is better not to use the clone sword for sword and spirit linkage... I have a better way." At this time, the monk said.</p>

    <p>Although the girl's body had been enlightened by him, using the sword-spirit linkage technique would not be life-threatening. However, the monk did not want the girl to use such painful methods in order to improve her combat power.</p>

    <p>"Master, do you have any better suggestions?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"I can transform Aohai's body and turn it into a huge sword and spirit container. Let Aohai continue to copy and clone himself in the container. In this case, it is actually equivalent to achieving the effect of sword and spirit linkage!"</p>

    <p>The monk said, "Even, the poor monk thinks that this is the ultimate evolved version! As long as the transformation is successful! Miss Sun Rong's Ao Hai will never be destroyed, and she will only need to manipulate a sword to call out hundreds of millions of Ao Hai for battle!"</p>

    <p>"Battle..."</p>

    <p>"'It can be like this?" Sun Rong covered her mouth in surprise.</p>

    <p>She knew how powerful the monk was, so she had no doubt that the monk could do all this.</p>

    <p>"These Aohais are constantly replicating in the container. At the same time, they can also be combined to increase their combat power. As long as the number of copies and clones is large enough, in theory, Miss Sun's combat power will have unlimited growth possibilities..."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and said: "Although Miss Sun only has the Foundation Building, as long as she has this sword, I can't guarantee it in other places. But on this earth, Miss Sun can defeat 99% of people."</p>

    <p>"The remaining 1%. Is it the master and classmate Wang Ling?" Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Han must have led us. But there may be other masters out there."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded and replied: "But to upgrade Aohai, we still need two things."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"I need Miss Ying'er to provide me with a formula for splitting," the monk said.</p>

    <p>The idea of upgrading Aohai into a Sword Spirit super container for Sun Rong was also a crazy idea that the monk had based on Sun Ying'er's Shadow ability.</p>

    <p>But after all, this matter involves the secret of Sun Ying'er's law. The monk thought that Sun Ying'er would not tell it easily.</p>

    <p>As a result, the white-haired girl in front of him was much more cheerful than the monk imagined: "This is easy. Rongrong and I are one. Helping Rongrong means helping me."</p>

    <p>"That's good."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded: "As for the second thing, it is the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube that I got when Ling Zhenren and I went to clear the Unspeakable Land a while ago. Since Miss Ying'er agreed to hand over the formula, then this matter is settled. Already."</p>

    <p>"But. Is that something that belongs to classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned: "If you ask for it like this, wouldn't it be bad?"</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren will never refuse to give it."</p>

    <p>The monk said confidently: "The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is certainly precious, but something like this is actually worthless in Ling Zhenren's eyes."</p>

    <p>At this point, Monk Jin Deng's words suddenly paused for a moment. He suddenly turned his attention to the girl: "Compared to the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube, Ling Zhenren actually knows very well in his heart that he has something more precious..."</p>

    <p>"What are you talking about, Master..." Sun Rong felt a little embarrassed again.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, there is no need to be embarrassed. I thought that Ling Zhenren would have an epiphany sooner or later. You just need to be more patient."</p>

    <p>"Aren't you a monk? Why do you look so understanding?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er came up and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Miss Ying'er doesn't know something. This poor monk once served as an emperor. He had three thousand beauties in his harem. Of course he understands."</p>

    <p>"Master was once an emperor?"Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>"I don't feel anything else. It's just a pain in my back."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhao Qingxian borrowed Fan Xing's body.</p>

    <p>He grabbed a jar of specimens from the biological anatomy room in the hospital and quickly left the hospital.</p>

    <p>The first priority. Of course is to solve yourself...</p>

    <p>The defects are gone.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian found the nearest river to the First Military Medical Hospital in Songhai City. As soon as he reached the river, he couldn't wait to start casting spells.</p>

    <p>Get ready to start summoning. Heavenly Dao River God.</p>

    <p>This is the way ordinary cultivators in God's Domain carry out "equivalent exchange."</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the Heavenly Dao River God does the work for you.</p>

    <p>Not everyone has the right to meet directly with Heavenly Dao Golden Men for fair and equal exchange.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is said to be "equivalent exchange." Only Heavenly Dao's little Golden Men are truly equivalent.</p>

    <p>Compared to Heavenly DaoGolden Men. In fact, most cultivators in the divine realm cannot get any bargains from Heavenly Dao River God...</p>

    <p>But now, Zhao Qingxian has no other option.</p>

    <p>"River God! River God! Please listen to my call!"</p>

    <p>In front of the river, Zhao Qingxian kneaded the spell in his hands and muttered something.</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>On the calm river surface, a slender figure rose from the sky following the sound.</p>

    <p>A handsome young man wearing a hairpin and long hair with phoenix eyes appeared in front of Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>Drops of water slipped from the young man's well-proportioned muscles, scattering an intoxicating light...</p>

    <p>His whole body was filled with the supreme aura of the Heavenly Dao Law. As soon as he spoke, Zhao Qingxian woke up: "Young Zhao Qingxian, you are still this golden elephant egg. You are still this silver elephant. Egg?"</p>

    <p>"elephant???"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian was shocked.</p>

    <p>The specimen he stole wasn't human?</p>
