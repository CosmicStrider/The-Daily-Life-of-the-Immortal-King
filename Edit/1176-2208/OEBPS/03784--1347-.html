  <h1>Chapter 1347 Listen to Mom</h1>

  <div>



<p>In the morning. Wang Ling chose a place. I planned to test the effect of my improved {Single Spell}.</p>

<p>Normally Wang Ling would not go out of his way to test spells.</p>

<p>But there are still a few days until Number 60 High School starts.</p>

<p>Wang Ling has a lot of spare time.</p>

<p>In addition, today's homework is finished. The video of self-study has also been recorded.</p>

<p>So why not go out and test the spell.</p>

<p>Principal Chen is said to have spent a lot of money on the green environment of the school.</p>

<p>Wang Ling Actually I want to see when school resumes next Monday.</p>

<p>What changes will happen to Number 60 High School?</p>

<p>Wang Ling dressed herself up very well. Mask, sunglasses and cap. None of them were pulled down.</p>

<p>A high-collar linen windbreaker and a pair of slim-fitting jeans fully reflect his good figure.</p>

<p>As for Wang Ling's outfit today.</p>

<p>The evaluation of the book of Sage Immortal is: It's a bit like a private detective who goes out to investigate his mistress.</p>

<p>So before Wang Ling went out, he stuffed the book of Sage Immortal into Lord Ma's mouth...</p>

<p>Test the spell. A suitable testing location is of course required.</p>

<p>As for the choice of location, Wang Ling already has the answer.</p>

<p>Changyang Xiuzhen Aquarium in the city center.</p>

<p>It is a place where many couples hang out.</p>

<p>That's right. Wang Ling is testing the spell on couples who openly show off their affection in public places like aquariums.</p>

<p>However, Wang Ling is not from the FFF group.</p>

<p>Breaking up a marriage is a very unethical thing.</p>

<p>So Wang Ling is actually somewhat prepared for this.</p>

<p>He added a new temporary additional condition to the {Single Spell}: thirty minutes after the spell takes effect, the {Single Spell} effect will be removed. And the couple will completely forget everything that happened between the spells. Unpleasant memories.</p>

<p>As long as this condition exists.</p>

<p>Wang Ling can be tested normally without damaging the relationship between the young lovers.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Wang Ling has already arrived in front of the aquarium.</p>

<p>This is the largest aquarium in the city center. The entire annex is made of glazed tiles. It presents a...</p>

<p>The shape of a whale.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock at noon, there will be a fountain show on the top of the aquarium. A large number of people come here to watch it every day.</p>

<p>Even on this working day, there is still an unprecedented grand scene in front of this venue.</p>

<p>There was a long queue at the ticket window.</p>

<p>Wang Ling queued for nearly thirty minutes.</p>

<p>"Sir, please show your second-generation ID card. Real-name registration is required to enter our venue." The lady at the ticket window said warmly and politely.</p>

<p>Wang Ling took the initiative to hand over his ID card.</p>

<p>The young lady finished swiping her identity information. Then she stood up with a face full of shock: "I didn't know Mr. Wang was here! Please don't blame Mr. Wang!"</p>

<p>"..." Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

<p>Wang... Mr. Wang?</p>

<p>When will he become President Wang...</p>

<p>"Mr. Wang can actually take the green channel next to the aquarium! You can enter the coffin directly with your ID card. There is no need to buy a ticket." The young lady smiled and pointed politely to the direction of the green channel next to the aquarium.</p>

<p>"Hmm..."Wang Ling was confused. He had no idea what was going on.</p>

<p>After leaving the team, I made some calculations with my fingers. I found out that it was Mr. Boss Sun who was responsible...</p>

<p>The aquarium of feelings is also a property of the Huaguo Shuilian Group?</p>

<p>The expression on Wang Ling's face was slightly helpless.</p>

<p>Aren't you a drug seller...</p>

<p>Why is the industrial chain underneath so rich?</p>

<p>Not many people can enter directly from the green channel. Wang Ling does not need to queue at all.</p>

<p>Just swipe your ID card and the fence of the green channel will open automatically.</p>

<p>"Welcome Mr. Wang!"</p>

<p>As soon as Wang Ling's ID card was swiped on, the artificial intelligence AI device on the fence made a sound. Wang Ling was shocked.</p>

<p>This is too high-profile.</p>

<p>Make Wang Ling feel a little uncomfortable...</p>

<p>After entering the gate, among the row of VIP tour guides standing in front of the gate, a tall and beautiful woman immediately came over and said, "Mr. Wang, do you need guide service?"</p>

<p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

<p>He refused on the spot. His main purpose was to test the spell. It was too inconvenient to have someone following him all over the place.</p>

<p>"Okay, Mr. Wang." The guide sister always smiled. Then she took the initiative to hand over a map of the venue: "All the facilities in the venue...</p>

<p>And restaurants. Mr. Wang can enjoy free VIP service with his ID card."</p>

<p>This map is specially made for the venue. It has the functions of automatic positioning and navigation projection.</p>

<p>Wang Ling can even place orders directly through the smart map.</p>

<p>There will be staff in the museum immediately to deliver what you want.</p>

<p>Open the restaurant that night.</p>

<p>Wang Ling browsed around the dazzling array of high-end seafood delicacies.</p>

<p>After discovering that there were no instant noodles, I angrily clicked the "Ã—" in the upper right corner of the map.</p>

<p>Then, he searched the map again and walked in the direction of "Love Hall."</p>

<p>In the Love Pavilion, all the captive water spirit beasts appear in pairs. Many couples will watch there...</p>

<p>For Wang Ling. It's a perfect place to test spells.</p>

<p>Follow the map's navigation function to move forward.</p>

<p>At this time, two familiar figures flashed past Wang Ling.</p>

<p>He saw Wang Zhen wearing the aquarium work uniform. He also walked towards the Love Pavilion.</p>

<p>And right next to Wang Zhen, a beautifully dressed girl gently held his arm.</p>

<p>Wang Ling rubbed his eyes. He was sure that he saw it correctly.</p>

<p>At the same time. The shock in Wang Ling's heart was like a thunderous initiation...</p>

<p>Wang Zhen in work uniform.</p>

<p>And Fang Xing in her feminine state...</p>

<p>Why are these two people here?</p>

<p>And it looks like the relationship is very close...</p>

<p>Wang Ling feels messy...</p><p>...</p>



<p>The so-called master's skill is fatal. It refers to the current situation of Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen.</p>

<p>After parking the sports car in the underground parking lot of the aquarium, Gu Shunzhi held the steering wheel. His temples were sweating.</p>

<p>Don't know why. He always has a bad feeling.</p>

<p>"What are you doing standing there? Get out of the car. Why do you look so worried today?" Liu Qingyi felt that something was wrong with Wang Zhen's situation.</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi opened his mouth and almost followed the words and called Liu Qingyi "Mom."</p>

<p>Pretending to be "Mom's" boyfriend. It's not easy.</p>

<p>Now, Gu Shunzhi has to think clearly every time he opens his mouth.</p>

<p>Can't follow the willow...</p>

<p>Qingyi continued her words.</p>

<p>What if I say "Mom" smoothly...</p>

<p>Everything fell into place.</p>

<p>"I just think, wouldn't it be good if we did this?" Gu Shunzhi was reluctant to give up, mainly because he did feel a very strong ominous premonition.</p>

<p>"I'm here. What are you afraid of! If something happens, I will take full responsibility!"</p>

<p>Liu Qingyi acted very resolutely. He stepped forward, took Gu Shunzhi's hand, and dragged him out.</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi had no choice but to compromise: "Mom, please slow down..."</p>

<p>Liu Qingyi: "???"</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi: "Trouble. Slow down..."</p>

<p>Liu Qingyi let go of her hand and frowned: "No! This is not the first time I heard you call me mom!"</p>

<p>Has it been discovered...</p>

<p>The expression on Gu Shunzhi's face was tense for a moment.</p>

<p>Just when he thought Liu Qingyi might have guessed everything.</p>
    
<p>At this moment, Liu Qingyi suddenly bent down and asked with great concern: "Do you have a serious Oedipus<sup>1</sup> complex?"</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(Oedipus is a mythological Greek King who killed his father and married his mother.)</dfn>

<p>Gu Shunzhi: "???"</p>

<p>"It's okay. I actually don't discriminate against mommies. Even if you look younger than me, you can't just call a girl mom. Do you understand? But because of our cooperative relationship, if you call me mom in private, I won't be angry. "Who makes my son so handsome?" Liu Qingyi smiled and reached out to rub Gu Shunzhi's head.</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi was shocked again: "..."</p>

<p>Fucking brain circuitry. It's so amazing!</p>

<p>For a moment, he found it difficult to resist!</p>

<p>At this time, Liu Qingyi smiled: "So, since I am your mother, should I, as a son, listen to my mother and not let her get hurt?"</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi was about to cry but had no tears: "I want to grow up quickly so I can protect her..."</p>

<p>Liu Qingyi nodded with satisfaction: "Be good! Follow mom. Pretend to be your boyfriend!"</p>

<p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p></div>
