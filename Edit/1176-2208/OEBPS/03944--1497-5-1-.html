  <h1>Chapter 1497 Kidnapping Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that there seem to be quite a lot of strange ghosts in {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>After all, this {Ghost Book} is the century-old foundation of the entire Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>A ghost named "Excavator."</p>

    <p>In fact, it is a kind of collective resentful spirit.</p>

    <p>The main composition comes from those countless lonely nights. The "billions of descendants" wrapped in toilet paper by boys and thrown into the toilet...</p>

    <p>Only a few sporadic ones have become small wraiths, which is not something to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>But I don't know when. The little things add up.</p>

    <p>This resulted in such an extremely terrifying ghost.</p>

    <p>In urban legends around the world, there are people who sometimes have blood in their stools or urine for unknown reasons when going to the toilet.</p>

    <p>The reason is that this collective evil spirit is causing trouble.</p>

    <p>Decades ago, the Jiugong family captured this object and gave this collective of resentful spirits the codename: Excavator.</p>

    <p>And this is the origin of this ghost.</p>

    <p>After dinner. Zhuo Yi left cash at the front desk.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that almost everyone in the store has gone to deal with personal problems. Even the bill collector is missing.</p>

    <p>He deliberately gave a little more, which was regarded as an apology on behalf of Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The future wife made a mistake. It was appropriate for him to give the store manager some understanding.</p>

    <p>In fact, although Jiugong Liangzi didn't say anything about his reckless behavior, he was actually deeply sorry in his heart.</p>

    <p>I even felt like I was a little neurotic at one point.</p>

    <p>This has never happened before.</p>

    <p>But now Jiugong Liangzi discovered.</p>

    <p>Whenever anything involves Zhuo Yi, she will always lose her mind a little bit. She will lose her original calm judgment.</p>

    <p>I thought of Zhuo Yi standing on the shore of the frozen lake after the snowstorm in my dream last night, with the sun shining on his face and waving to her.</p>

    <p>The girl's face became a little hot involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Send Wang Ling and Sun Rong back respectively.</p>

    <p>In the passenger seat, the girl who seemed to be taking a nap with her eyes closed suddenly made a gurgling sound from her abdomen.</p>

    <p>The scene was a little embarrassing for a while...</p>

    <p>Tonight's dinner was too noisy. Jiugong Liangzi didn't eat well at all.</p>

    <p>And due to the excessive drive of "ghosts", the girl's consumption increased. She became hungrier than before she had eaten.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi originally planned to stay up a little longer and order a midnight snack when he got back to his home.</p>

    <p>As a result, my stomach growled unsatisfactorily at this moment.</p>

    <p>"Hungry?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi raised his eyebrows and asked, "Would you like to have a late-night snack with me?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi knew that Zhuo Yi must have noticed that he was pretending to sleep.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, he opened his eyes and said, "The roadside stall is not clean."</p>

    <p>"Who said I would take you to eat at a roadside stall?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "I can make it for you."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was surprised when he heard these words: "You can also cook?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. When I was in the grassroots army, I worked in the cooking class for a period of time."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled confidently and said: "Of course. It's a bit late now. If you want to go back and rest, I'll send you back now. If you want to have a midnight snack, come with me. Cadre apartment. But I ate this late-night snack. I'm afraid it's already early in the morning. It doesn't seem to be good for the development of minors."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words made Jiugong Liangzi silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>She swallowed the saliva in her mouth.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether it's because I'm looking forward to Zhuo Yi's food or because I'm really hungry. I feel a little confused.</p>

    <p>"You have always been a cheerful person. Is it so difficult to make a decision?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held the steering wheel and returned his gaze. He deliberately did not look at Jiugong Liangzi's red face.</p>

    <p>"Or, because you heard you were going to my apartment, you thought of something else?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's eyes straightened when he heard these words.</p>

    <p>All these words were said by Zhuo Yi. If she doesn't go now, she seems to have a guilty conscience.</p>

    <p>So she folded her arms and rolled her eyes at Zhuo Yi. She twisted her eyebrows and looked at him.</p>

    <p>"Just go. Who is afraid of whom?"</p>

    <p>"Okay."</p>

    <p>As a planner, Zhuo Yi was of course very happy to see that his fishing strategy was successful.</p>

    <p>In fact, after Jiugong Liangzi agreed, he realized that he seemed to have been tricked by Zhuo Yi again.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Zhuo Yi always seems to stimulate the chord in her heart.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi still refused to admit this matter.</p>

    <p>Although it seems that I already have the answer in my heart.</p>

    <p>But between her and Zhuo Yi... perhaps they can only become close friends at best. There is absolutely no possibility of going any further...</p>

    <p>Every time he thinks about this, Jiugong Liangzi's mood is like a ball of tangled cotton thread. It's a mess.</p>

    <p>The family pressure behind her may have already cut the distance between her and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Following Zhuo Yi to the cadre apartment. Jiugong Liangzi was surprised by where Zhuo Yi lived.</p>

    <p>It's not that it's gorgeous. But...everything is so clean!</p>

    <p>The wooden floor is spotless. There is still a fragrance in the air. All the smooth surfaces are bright and reflective. It looks like it has been wiped freshly.</p>

    <p>What surprised Jiugong Liangzi the most was Zhuo Yi's obsessive-compulsive attitude towards orderliness at home.</p>

    <p>The books on the bookshelves, the hangings on the walls, and the knick-knacks on the countertops all have uniform colors. Even their placement is clearly on the same horizontal line.</p>

    <p>It's simply cleaner and more beautiful than her villa...</p>

    <p>As a man's bedroom. Jiugong Liangzi thinks this is a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>What's the saying, clean and tidy, no bad smell, if not a transvestite then they are gay ...</p>

    <p>"You live alone?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Zhuo Yi nodded. He couldn't help but smile: "I would like to find a wife to accompany me. But there must be someone willing to marry me."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Zhuo Yi was pouring lemonade for Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>He deliberately did not look at the girl's expression, because he knew just by thinking that the little girl must be blushing with embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"You also cleaned the house by yourself? Didn't you ask for cleaning or something?" Jiugong Liangzi took the cup handed by Zhuo Yi. She didn't dare to look him in the eyes.</p>

    <p>"You know what I do. Sometimes for work reasons, I may bring some information back. So calling it cleaning is not safe. There is a risk of leakage." Zhuo Yi laughs Laughed. Said: "Just cleaning up. It's not like I don't have any skills."</p>

    <p>There are actually many cleaning Talisman on the market. With these Talisman, even Zhuo Yi will not be too tired to clean it alone.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's family background is actually not bad. A clean, organized and ritualistic life is what he has always pursued.</p>

    <p>It's not that Zhuo Yi is doing well. It's just that he is a little more particular than many boys.</p>

    <p>But there is a saying: a golden nest or a silver nest is not as good as your own doghouse.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter what your home is like. It doesn't matter whether it's messy or clean. As long as you live happily, outsiders naturally have no right to interfere.</p>

    <p>The "Houlangs" who are still struggling work hard from dawn to dusk every day in order to get a better life. They are tired enough.</p>

    <p>As for whether you want to keep your home as spotless as yours. Zhuo Yi feels that this is purely your choice.</p>

    <p>You can't use one standard to limit everyone. After all, everyone's conditions are different.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to live life.</p>

    <p>As long as you can enjoy yourself, you don't need to care about what others think.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to make for me as a midnight snack?"</p>

    <p>"I'll give it to you to eat."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi pretended not to understand: "You are talking about instant noodles, right?"</p>

    <p>"Can you tell by looking at it yourself?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled. Jiugong Liangzi had already heard the clinking of pots and pans coming from the kitchen.</p>

    <p>When she walked into the kitchen with curiosity, she saw Zhuo Yi rolling noodles.</p>

    <p>The late night snack is actually hand-made noodles!</p>

    <p>The thick and large rolling pin rolled back and forth on the dough. After pushing it into a thin piece of dough, Jiugong Liangzi saw a familiar emerald green light flash through.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the dough was cut into noodles of the same thickness and length.</p>

    <p>I have to say that the knife work is so exquisite. It looks like it was processed by a machine. The key is that the cut edge is even dyed with a light green bamboo color.</p>

    <p>At this time Zhuo Yi said: "This is hand-rolled bamboo noodles. I just figured it out recently. Even my apprentice has never eaten it."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi had doubts about this: "Bamboo noodles...so the emerald green aura just now can't be..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. It's my Spirit Sword: Pre."</p>

    <p>"You use the spirit sword to cut noodles???"</p>

    <p>"Actually, my knife skills are not bad. It's almost the same as pre-cut. But aren't you hungry? It would be more convenient to use pre-cut."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled gently: "And the pre-cut dough has a fresh and elegant bamboo fragrance. It also has the effect of scraping oil and anti-sugar. The sugar content of pasta is relatively high, which is a taboo for weight loss. But I think so Deal with it. No matter how much you eat, you don't have to worry about getting fat."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi understood immediately.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi did this for his own sake.</p>

    <p>It can fill your stomach without getting fat.</p>

    <p>As far as late night snacks go, this "bamboo noodles" is simply perfect.</p>

    <p>In order to dispel Jiugong Liangzi's doubts about his knife skills, Zhuo Yi missed a hand when cutting the ingredients for rolling the noodles.</p>

    <p>He held the kitchen knife. The shadowy light of the knife on the chopping board moved rhythmically. In a short while, the cucumber shreds and radish shreds were cut and put together. The attractive color greatly increased appetite.</p>

    <p>Then. Zhuo Yi took advantage of the cooking time to set up another pot and prepare the special diced pork sauce to go with the bamboo noodles.</p>

    <p>These movements are astonishingly proficient in Zhuo Yi's hands. If Jiugong Liangzi hadn't seen it with his own eyes today, Zhuo Yi, who couldn't even walk, would actually have such a side.</p>

    <p>In modern cultivation society, a man who can cook and understands cooking skills is a bonus.</p>

    <p>She felt like Zhuo Yi was carefully cooking bamboo noodles. Her whole body was glowing.</p>

    <p>"You actually know how to cook..."</p>

    <p>"I told you. I worked in the grassroots cooking class for a while." Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>There is really no need for him to lie about this. The experience he had in training from the grassroots army was actually much richer than Jiugong Liangzi imagined.</p>

    <p>The iron-clad discipline in the army, strict military management, and various trainings. Whether it is spiritual sword training, long-range magic weapon training, physical training or picnic cooking...these are things that will never be forgotten in a lifetime.</p>

    <p>Experience points. Always valid.</p>

    <p>For Zhuo Yi, those experiences back then were the best training ground for him to grow from a boy to a man.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of those experiences.</p>

    <p>When faced with the sudden arrival of Er Ha in the human world six years ago, Zhuo Yi, despite knowing the disparity in combat power, still rushed to the front line regardless of his own safety.</p>

    <p>He knew that he might die.</p>

    <p>But he still rushed forward without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Now Zhuo Yi sometimes thinks about it carefully. He feels that maybe Wang Ling agreed to accept him as a disciple. I'm afraid this is also one of the bonus points...</p>

    <p>After the vegetables and diced meat sauce were ready, Zhuo Yi poured all the ingredients into the pot and started the final mixing of the noodles. After stirring thoroughly for two minutes, he brought the pot to the table.</p>

    <p>"So many...are you feeding pigs..." Jiugong Liangzi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"I'll eat with you. Of course. Mainly because I'm afraid you won't have enough to eat." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Tch. I don't know what it tastes like. What a waste." Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Zhuo Yi with disdain.</p>

    <p>Then, she took the chopsticks handed over by Zhuo Yi, picked up a piece of noodles, covered her mouth, and slowly sucked it into her mouth like a lady.</p>

    <p>"How does it taste?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Looking forward to Jiugong Liangzi's evaluation.</p>

    <p>He saw the expression on the girl's face that seemed to have a flash of light, and he already knew it in his heart.</p>

    <p>What a pity. This is not anime.</p>

    <p>If there was a picture of a group of little girls in cheongsam fanning themselves behind {Chinese Little Boss}.</p>

    <p>If it's {The Spirit of the Halberd Eater}, maybe I can blow up some clothes or something...</p>

    <p>"Hmph. It's just okay. It's probably half as good as my cook."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi said after taking the first bite.</p>

    <p>Then she ate the entire pot of noodles.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said they were eating together. But in fact, they only ate a small bowl. Mainly to taste the saltiness.</p>

    <p>When cleaning the table, Zhuo Yi showed off the empty pot to Jiugong Liangzi, "I told you, it won't be wasted."</p>

    <p>"Don't be too proud. I just think waste is a shameful behavior. It's not because your noodles are delicious." Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>

    <p>She touched her belly. She felt that she had indeed eaten a little too much. But the amazing thing was... she didn't even feel that her belly was full at all.</p>

    <p>Although this is the first time I have eaten bamboo noodles from Zhuo Yi, I have to say that it does have an endless aftertaste.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi secretly looked at the satisfied girl. While feeling secretly happy in her heart, she was also a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>After eating the noodles, Jiugong's belly seemed to be a little bigger, but it still didn't grow where it should...</p>

    <p>Pity!</p>

    <p>After washing the pot, Zhuo Yi saw the girl sitting on the sofa, looking very worried.</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about?" Zhuo Yi found a question.</p>

    <p>People say that when you are full, you will think about money. But Jiugong Liangzi is just the opposite. When you are full, you will start thinking wildly...</p>

    <p>"I'm wondering if it was the right decision to ask my classmates Sun Rong to go to Jiugong's house..." Jiugong Liangzi was worried.</p>

    <p>How dangerous Jiugong's family is. Only Jiugong Liangzi knows it himself.</p>

    <p>Not counting the forces on the surface, there are also undercurrents surging behind the scenes. Once you fall into it, it may be difficult to escape.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I'm keeping an eye on you."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's calm eyes gave Jiugong Liangzi some comfort at this time.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the time and found that it was already one o'clock in the morning. He took the initiative and asked: "Shall I take you back? Or should you stay with me?"</p>

    <p>"Who wants to live here..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi slapped Zhuo Yi hard on the shoulder and stood up immediately.</p>

    <p>As soon as she stood up, Zhuo Yi grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt like a yo-yo. Before he could react, he was already being hugged by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing..." Faced with such rude behavior, Jiugong Liangzi was ashamed and annoyed. But the strange thing was that her body did not reject Zhuo Yi from approaching her.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I just want a hug."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's voice was very low, as if he was coquettish. Jiugong Liangzi's heart trembled when he heard it.</p>

    <p>"Let me go...I really want to go back." Jiugong Liangzi pinched Zhuo Yi's thigh hard. He blushed and broke away from Zhuo Yi's arms.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, classmate Jiugong. I was rude." Zhuo Yi smiled and raised his hands in a gesture of surrender.</p>

    <p>"I believe you are a ghost..." Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>

    <p>She had discovered it a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Apologize humbly. Don't dare to do it next time... This is Zhuo Yi's true attitude of admitting his mistakes.</p>

    <p>After the scene fell into a brief silence, Jiugong Liangzi felt that his mood had calmed down a little. His whole face suddenly sank and returned to a cold look: "I'm leaving."</p>

    <p>"Shall I give it to you?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"You don't need to send it."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's voice was cold. The corners of his lips twitched slightly.</p>

    <p>The better Zhuo Yi is to her. This makes her feel more awake.</p>

    <p>It's like reflection after a hangover. Jiugong Liangzi is reflecting on the invisible future between himself and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>When she walked to the door, she seemed to have a sense of decline. It made Zhuo Yi feel a little distressed. She had the urge to step forward and hug her again.</p>

    <p>But he felt that this move might offend the girl, so he restrained himself and did not rush forward.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. He felt that Jiugong Liangzi suddenly seemed worried.</p>

    <p>Before leaving Zhuo Yi's apartment, she left her last words to Zhuo Yi: "Don't do this anymore... It's better for us to be friends."</p>

    <p>Then, she quickly unscrewed the handle and stepped out without hesitation.</p>

    <p>"Have you been rejected?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's heart twitched fiercely. He smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He knew that Jiugong Liangzi did not open his heart so easily.</p>

    <p>This is expected.</p>

    <p>Because I was worried about the girl going home alone.</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiAfter Jiugong Liangzi went out, he immediately sent "Yu" out and followed him secretly all the way.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, if you want to get rid of me, it's not that easy..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi stood by the window. Looking lovingly towards the direction of the villa where Jiugong Liangzi lived, he smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>No matter what Jiugong Liangzi says or thinks.</p>

    <p>He has identified it.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of him is the happiness of his life.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>No one can sleep tonight. Whether it is Zhuo Yi or Jiugong Liangzi. It is destined to be a sleepless night.</p>

    <p>On the other side, far inside the Jiugong family on Sun Island. In the elegant mansion deep in the inner courtyard. The person who also had trouble sleeping was the sixth wife of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Akano Hoshiki. This was the name of the sixth wife before she married into the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>And now Mrs. Six has changed her name to: Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>As the youngest and most beautiful of all the wives of Jiugong's father, she is also the one with the strongest financial resources in her natal family.</p>

    <p>When the sixth wife married into the Jiugong family, it caused a lot of turmoil.</p>

    <p>She is the only daughter of the famous underworld "Zhai Xing Group" on Sun Island. Many people dream of marrying the Zhai Xing Group. But unexpectedly, Akano Hoshiki chose the Jiugong family in the end.</p>

    <p>It was a quiet night. Jiugong Xinghui was sitting beside the kotatsu in his elegant home, waiting for news from the Huaxiu country.</p>

    <p>She was wearing a black fur coat. There was a depth in her eyes.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Six."</p>

    <p>A slightly older but still magnetic voice came. The person who came was none other than Yingxian Heming.</p>

    <p>This is the foreign affairs liaison officer of the Jiugong family who had a phone call with Jiugong Liangzi before. Now he is here. The main purpose is to inform him about the exchange student plan.</p>

    <p>The sixth lady in front of me is the last one.</p>

    <p>Because the Sixth Lady did not have the habit of using modern technology and communication magic weapons, many things required oral notification.</p>

    <p>Since Mrs. Six married into the Jiugong family, she rarely interacts with other members of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>In addition to going out, the scope of activities is this elegant house and the small garden around the elegant house.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming always has a feeling.</p>

    <p>He felt that Mrs. Six was a dangerous woman who had seen through everything.</p>

    <p>"Is this the news from Liangzi?" Madam Six asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Madam, Miss Liangzi said, a group of exchange students from Number 60 High School will be coming soon. This time, our Jiugong family will be responsible for hosting them," Yingxian Heming said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. These are distinguished guests from afar. They should be taken seriously." Madam Six opened her charming eyes and said with a smile, "Have the arrangements for the school responsible for the handover been made properly?"</p>

    <p>"It's Jiudaohe High School." Yingxian Heming answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>This is a school funded by the Jiugong family. It is also very close to the Jiugong family's residence in Dongfu City, Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Before Jiugong Liangzi transferred to another school, she attended Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>So when she heard this name, the sixth wife already knew it in her mind. There was a thoughtful expression on her face.</p>

    <p>There was silence for a moment, then he asked again: "What about the accommodation and board arrangements? Are you going to live on campus or at the Jiugong family's residence?"</p>

    <p>"Rooms have been prepared on both sides. Look at Number 60 High School. The leading teacher and the children have choices. They can come and go freely."</p>

    <p>"Understood." The Sixth Lady nodded: "Thank you for your hard work, Yingxian."</p>

    <p>"You're welcome, ma'am."</p>

    <p>"Besides, help me prepare. I'm going out."</p>

    <p>"What is Mrs. Six going to do?"</p>

    <p>"I just went to the Buddhist temple to pray for blessings. There are guests coming from far away. This is also my intention."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side of the Jiugong family's mansion, Jiugong Xiushi was also having a secret discussion with One-Eyed Samurai beside him in the mansion where he lived.</p>

    <p>"I think this exchange student program is for me." Jiugong Xiushi frowned.</p>

    <p>Together with One-Eyed Samurai, he planned a replica of the {Ghost Book} riot incident. He wanted to kill Jiugong Liangzi. But he didn't know why.</p>

    <p>All the powerful ghosts that were released were eradicated. Jiugong Liangzi escaped smoothly without any damage at all.</p>

    <p>"The riot plan cannot be used a second time in a short period of time. And it is difficult to provide evidence. I handled it very cleanly, Master." One-Eyed Samurai stood aside and said: "Besides, our eyes and ears have confirmed. Miss Liangzi is still here. Huaxiu Junior High School, there is no need to mess up the situation. I thought it was just an ordinary exchange student program."</p>

    <p>"But I heard that Miss Sun from the Huaguo Shuilian Group is coming..."</p>

    <p>"Just because I heard this, I felt relieved."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai smiled and said: "Miss Liangzi has a long-standing grudge with that Miss Sun. And I also heard that Miss Liangzi fell in love with Miss Sun on her first day at Number 60 High School and was raped. A non-lethal hallucinogenic drug that once embarrassed Miss Liangzi."</p>

    <p>"There is such a thing." Jiugong Xiushi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"That's right." One-Eyed Samurai continued: "Since the two of them are not compatible, then I think our chance may have come."</p>

    <p>"How to say?"</p>

    <p>He looked at Duyan.</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said: "If we can take advantage of Miss Sun's participation in this exchange meeting and make good friends with Miss Sun, we may not need to deal with Miss Liangzi. This is a tactic in the art of war..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi smiled coldly: "Killing someone with a borrowed knife? That's easy for you to say."</p>

    <p>Who is Sun Rong? Jiugong Xiushi has also heard about it for a long time.</p>

    <p>It is extremely difficult to win over such a young lady. Moreover, the Huaguo Shuilian Group is essentially in competition with the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi thought a lot. She didn't think Sun Rong would easily join the Jiugong family dispute.</p>

    <p>If this matter is exposed, I am afraid it will also have a certain impact on the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Feel free to join other families' internal wars. This is foolish behavior.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun Rong lacks nothing. Whether it's money or material things, we can't be satisfied. Therefore, we can only find another way." At this time, One-Eyed Samurai had a sneer on his fierce face. It was shocking to see. People get cold.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi was curious: "Do you have any idea?"</p>

    <p>"I have another piece of information. It is said that Miss Sun Rong had an affair with a classmate named Wang in the same class." One-Eyed Samurai said: "And this time, among the people accompanying him, the other two exchanged All students are boys named Wang...I just don't know which one of them it is."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said this. Jiugong Xiushi suddenly showed an expression of understanding: "I understand! You want to..."</p>

    <p>He knows his Duyan's style of doing things very well.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Since we can't win over Miss Sun through money and materials, then we'll start with the boy that Miss Sun Rong likes. Maybe there's still a certain chance."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai said: "But because I was not sure which boy named Wang in the accompanying team she liked, I could only tie up those two boys."</p>

    <p>"Is this possible..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi suddenly felt that this plan was not reliable.</p>

    <p>"It's just two boys from the Foundation Building period. They can't resist at all." Duyan said confidently: "Even if there is a leading teacher guarding him, then just lead the leading teacher away."</p>

    <p>"It won't turn into a diplomatic incident, right?" Jiugong Xiushi was still worried.</p>

    <p>"These two boys have ordinary family backgrounds. It may be difficult for an ordinary existence like this to make waves. I still hope that the young master can think clearly because this is the best opportunity in front of him."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai feels that he has considered this matter very carefully.</p>

    <p>Although on the surface it was a bit of a threat to Miss Sun, after all, this operation was not launched against Miss Sun. It would be too exaggerated to escalate it to a diplomatic issue.</p>

    <p>And he won't really kill those two boys. It doesn't have to be kidnapping. He can just frame the two men out and monitor them for a period of time as he likes.</p>

    <p>The overall risk of action is very low. And once he succeeds and wins the support of Miss Sun, Duyan even feels that he can retire.</p>

    <p>With the financial resources of Miss Sun, there is no need to worry about Jiugong Xiushi being unable to assume the position of head of the family.</p>

    <p>However, whether this matter can be accomplished in the end mainly depends on the opinion of Jiugong Xiushi.</p>

    <p>Duyan is just a force, errand boy and counselor. He cannot make decisions at critical moments. He cannot overstep his authority.</p>

    <p>This is also out of respect for his deceased old master, Jiugong Xiushi's biological mother.</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Xiushi heard Duyan's opinion, he sat in a wheelchair and thought for a long time as if in a daze.</p>

    <p>There is not much time left for him.</p>

    <p>This time the riot plan of the replica {Ghost Book} failed. Although it did not directly kill Jiugong Liangzi, it also attracted the attention of Jiugong Xiushi and the forces of the Sixth Madam.</p>

    <p>The Sixth Lady represents the most prestigious underworld organization "Zhai Xing Group" on Sun Island!</p>

    <p>In other words. In other words, "Zhai Xing Group" also wants to interfere in the future election of the head of the family...</p>

    <p>This is something Jiugong Xiushi didn't expect.</p>

    <p>If we want to compete with Zhai Xing Group in the future, the little chips they have are simply not enough.</p>

    <p>There must be more powerful foreign aid to help.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Jiugong Xiushi couldn't help but take a deep breath: "It's up to people to plan things, and it's up to God to make things happen!"</p>

    <p>"So. Master's answer?" One-Eyed Samurai asked.</p>

    <p>I saw Jiugong Xiushi gritted his teeth and said, "Fuck it!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, December 14th. This morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong arrived at Songhai City International Boat Park on time. Through the huge glass of the airport and the bright sunshine, Wang Ling saw huge immortal boats moored on the immortal boat pad.</p>

    <p>Last night Wang Ling also had a sleepless night.</p>

    <p>It's not because of other reasons. It's because he is clearing out the pocket money he has saved.</p>

    <p>Compared to Sun Rong. His pocket money is obviously not enough. Maybe he doesn't even have change.</p>

    <p>Years of New Year's money, as well as pocket money given by Father Wang. Wang Ling all converted cash into his mobile wallet. Total amount: 8720.3...</p>

    <p>Including the 5,000 yuan fund that Mother Wang alone supported before going abroad this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only has 13,000 yen on him.</p>

    <p>One word summary: poor.</p>

    <p>It took me 16 years to save so much. In Wang Ling's eyes, it's really not enough.</p>

    <p>Of course. There are various reasons for this. For example, spending money to buy limited edition crispy noodles, and waiting a minute for the pocket money deducted by Father Wang for no reason! These are one of the reasons why Wang Ling's wallet shrinks year by year.</p>

    <p>The key is that he can't use his ability to make money yet.</p>

    <p>This is a headache.</p>

    <p>He estimated that his sister Ah Nuan's birth date was approaching. He wanted to take advantage of this trip abroad to buy some interesting gifts for his sister. Small clothes, small shoes, small pants, etc...</p>

    <p>However, with the prices abroad, it may be difficult to make a big difference with Wang Ling's money.</p>

    <p>Infant and child products are expensive these days. Clothes of the same brand don't have much fabric for children to wear. As a result, the price is still the same.</p>

    <p>So. Do you want to take advantage of this period to work on Sun Island? Make more money?</p>

    <p>Last night. Wang Ling had been thinking very seriously about the funding issue.</p>

    <p>He couldn't possibly bother Sun Rong about buying a gift for Ah Nuan. It was his own intention. If he took other people's money, it would completely change.</p>

    <p>Although he knew that if he opened his mouth, with that eldest lady's temper, she might give him the entire shopping mall to choose from.</p>

    <p>But this is really too high-profile and unnecessary.</p>

    <p>So it's actually not a bad idea to make some extra money by doing odd jobs.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family was originally a family on Sun Island that hunted ghosts and exorcised demons. There was no need to worry about not getting any orders in this field.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, Wang Ling reckons that he will just have to go get some information. It should be no problem to deal with some monsters.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, killing demons and demons does not count as using abilities...</p>

    <p>Because he actually doesn't need to use his ability at all.</p>

    <p>Just go and stand for a moment. Those ghosts will be scared to death.</p>

    <p>So. In order to facilitate myself to take the task.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spent some time researching the native language on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>I have to say that language learning is still very difficult. Every country has different characters and pronunciation is also very important.</p>

    <p>It took Wang Ling about three minutes to learn the native language of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>It's really hard for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Compared to when he was learning Heavenly Dao and Fate, it didn't seem to take that long...</p>

    <p>After passing the green visa channel first with Sun Rong, Sun Rong noticed the solemn look on Wang Ling's expression. He looked a little autistic.</p>

    <p>She pulled aside Zhuo Yi who had come to see him off and asked quietly: "Zhuo Yi senior knows. Classmate Wang Ling is. What's wrong?"</p>

    <p>If we didn't know Wang Ling's true strength, Sun Rong would definitely think that Wang Ling was in this state because he didn't sleep well or was sick.</p>

    <p>But now it is obvious that Wang Ling has something on his mind.</p>

    <p>This slow guy always likes to keep things in his heart. It makes Sun Rong always feel like he doesn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>The girl has no other choice but to ask Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"This... I'm not sure." Zhuo Yi scratched his face in embarrassment: "But looking at Master's expression, there are only two possibilities. One: There is no limited edition crisp noodles on Sun Island."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Okay. This is Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"What about number two?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe the pocket money was deducted again." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>These words actually reminded Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>What are you most worried about when going abroad? Of course it is lack of money...</p>

    <p>If it was a problem in this area, the girl thought it was a possibility. She felt that she should have thought of it long ago, because the day of Ah Nuan's breaking out of the shell was approaching.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Wang Ling is worrying about the gift for the hatching day right now.</p>

    <p>Money. It's never been an issue for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But in fact, she also knew very well what the meaning of this birthday gift was. And this was the reason why Wang Ling kept this matter in her stomach.</p>

    <p>If I hadn't used my own pocket money to buy a gift for my sister, it would probably have no meaning at all, right?</p>

    <p>She wanted to support Wang Ling in her heart. But she would not want to send money directly. With her stupid personality, she would never accept it.</p>

    <p>So I walked. Sun Rong also became autistic along with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"There will always be a way..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held his forehead. He smiled helplessly and comforted in a low voice: "Take advantage of this time to go abroad. Let's communicate more with Master."</p>

    <p>"I will." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>Then. Zhuo Yi brought the two autistic boys and girls to the VIP lounge before departure.</p>

    <p>All procedures have been completed.</p>

    <p>Just wait for the landing port of the immortal boat to open.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was alone in the lounge for a while.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, a takeoff reminder was broadcast nearby.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, a tall young man in the distance, who had wrapped himself up to hide himself, walked towards their location with slender legs.</p>

    <p>As soon as he got close, he reached out to rub Wang Ling's head: "Sorry, Ling Ling! I'm late!"</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ming's voice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his head. He saw that Wang Ming had not only disguised himself externally. In fact, even his appearance had changed. It was completely different from Wang Ming's original appearance.</p>

    <p>It looked like he had used a face-squeezing elixir to reshape his facial features.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's disguise can't be said to be good-looking, but it can't be said to be ugly either. It's just the kind of public face that is easily forgotten when thrown into a sea of people.</p>

    <p>And this is exactly what the official asked Wang Ming to achieve.</p>

    <p>It took a long time. Finally, we met Wang Ling and Sun Rong here. Wang Ming was very excited.</p>

    <p>Sitting down on the sofa, he put an arm directly across Wang Ling's neck. There was a smirk on his face. It was still difficult to conceal his sinful personality: "My approval process... until early in the morning. I just got it done. Hey, I just want to go abroad with my brother and sister-in-law. Is it easy?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Sun Rong immediately blushed: "Brother Ming, stop kidding me..."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter what you call me now. When you get out, be sure to remember to call me second brother." Wang Ming reminded.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Second brother."</p>

    <p>"In addition, I want to tell you something. After we get there, we have to wait for seniors Yinzi and Jin Deng at the Immortal Boatyard on the Sun Island. They were busy with my business last night. I need to get my approval. The process hasn't been completed yet, so I have to wait for the next team to come over." Wang Ming said via voice message.</p>

    <p>This is not a voice transmission technique. Instead, Wang Ming directly uses his own brain waves to communicate spiritually.</p>

    <p>An ordinary person's brain waves can be developed to such an extent... It is true that only Wang Ming can do it in the world.</p>

    <p>So it's no wonder why the authorities were so cautious when approving Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ming suddenly frowned.</p>

    <p>There was an alert look in his eyes. He continued to use brain waves to secretly communicate with Wang Ling and Sun Rong: "Do you feel anything?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling and Sun Rong both nodded.</p>

    <p>Someone is watching them.</p>

    <p>And this man was a passenger on the same flight as them. He was a man wearing a woolen hat, sunglasses, and a black down jacket.</p>

    <p>"How is the situation?" At this time, a voice came from the miniature headset in the man's ear.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Everything goes well..."</p>

    <p>"Be careful. Don't get discovered."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Three Foundation Building students. If I can't accomplish this task. How can I face the young master?"</p>

    <p>Although I have been demonstrating with sunglasses and pretending to read a newspaper.</p>

    <p>But this person obviously didn't expect that he would start from the moment he had evil intentions.</p>

    <p>He has already been targeted by his surveillance target.</p>

    <p>He didn't even think about it.</p>

    <p>The three objects I am monitoring.</p>

    <p>One is the most powerful brain on earth.</p>

    <p>One is the strongest Foundation Building on Earth.</p>

    <p>And the last one... is the father of the earth...</p>
