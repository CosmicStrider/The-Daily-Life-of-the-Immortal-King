  <h1>I want to announce something to you: I will serve as the chief director and chief screenwriter of Immortal Wangsi Animation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hello, all book friends of {The Daily Life of the Immortal King}. I am Ku Xuan. Today's single chapter mainly wants to explain to you in detail what I was doing during the few months I disappeared.</p>

    <p>Starting in 2017, the Immortal King series has been accompanying everyone for five years without realizing it. The Immortal King's daily life animation has also completed its third season.</p>

    <p>Today, I officially announce to you that the fourth season animation of The Immortal King's Daily Life has entered into preparation and production. As the original author, I will also officially serve as the chief director and chief screenwriter of the fourth season animation of The Immortal King's Daily Life.</p>

    <p>The work I am involved in includes but is not limited to: trailer PV script (storyboard confirmation, music requirements), episode outline creation, overall creation of the script, music production requirements, production requirements and review of new characters and new scenes Work, storyboard screen review, production review, synopsis filing, etc. In terms of art, my friend Ouyang Shikun, who was also the chief director of the previous seasons, will assist me in completing the work. During this time, I almost devoted myself to it. I was very nervous. , excited and never tired of it.</p>

    <p>The fourth season of animation will revolve around the story of Sword Master Yi Jianchuan and his junior brother Xie Jian Shen. Heavenly Dao Little Golden Men will also officially enter the entire animation as a new setting throughout the fourth season. Wang Ling will get A powerful addition to the show.</p>

    <p>To be honest, when I received the invitation from the production team, I was a little scared because I had never been an animation director before. I was not sure whether I was qualified for this job. I knew that once I accepted I took this job. It will also shoulder greater responsibilities, pressure and missions. But in the end, I chose to take this step. Because this is my own work.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the animation project for the fourth season of Immortal King, my good brother Huang Shengdong (the original artist of the daily life animated characters of Immortal King) passed away unexpectedly due to a heart attack. Originally, I had roped him in to continue participating in the production of the fourth season. However, It's a pity that God is jealous of Yingcai. As I said, I will continue to work hard with his dream.</p>

    <p>It's been four years. Each season of Immortal King's animation has made little progress due to various trials and errors and the accumulation of experience. I would like to thank the producer and production team for their trust in me. I would like to thank my old employer Qidian Editorial Department for their support and tolerance. Also Thank you for all your encouragement and love for Immortal King. I will definitely do my best to make Immortal King season 4! This will be a brand new beginning! It is impossible to be bad. Immortal King novel The serialization will still continue~</p>

    <p>Also please everyone. Stay tuned.</p>

    <p>The original author, chief director, and chief screenwriter of The Immortal King's Daily Life Season 4 animation: Ku Xuan. Sincerely!</p>
