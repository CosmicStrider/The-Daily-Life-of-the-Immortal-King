  <h1>Chapter 1656 The three chefs are ecstatic. What a good guy! I'm a good guy!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is a tavern called "Sega" in the Sixth Ring Road of the slums. The sign hanging at the entrance of the tavern smells like light pollution.</p>

    <p>The purple neon lights flickered with a strange frequency.</p>

    <p>This is the most prosperous and lively place in the slums of this technological and spiritual city.</p>

    <p>The rich in the core area earn not only the money of the rich, but also the money of the poor. For example, Zhu Yuanrun is engaged in the black business of underground boxing rings.</p>

    <p>But now the wealthy businessmen controlled by Wang Ming have not returned. In addition to several large auction houses operating in the core area, they are also the behind-the-scenes beneficiaries of many taverns and chain bathing centers.</p>

    <p>For the poor, life can never be separated from bathhouses and wine. Both of these are excellent ways to relieve stress after a day's fatigue.</p>

    <p>Before coming here. Wang Ming has already informed Jia Bugui's servants. To clear out the tavern. In order to leave a place for the Office of Strategic Deception members to come to this world. To have a meeting place.</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei and Er Ha arrived, they were the first to arrive based on the transmission from Wang Ming's brainwave.</p>

    <p>After coming to the Virtual Realm. Er Ha rarely transformed himself into a human form. In his human form, his green hair would be laughed at in the modern cultivation city.</p>

    <p>But when you come to this science and technology city, you won't. Except for people outside the core area, every mechanized cultivator shows off his or her own personality to the extreme. They have colorful and killer hairstyles.</p>

    <p>The human form of Er Ha has fluorescent green hair. It can even be regarded as an expression of personality here.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming and others arrived, they pushed open the door and walked in. They found that they were each holding a glass of whiskey with ice, tasting it carefully.</p>

    <p>After meeting, several people held their fists and bowed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhuo Yi: "I've met Zhenjun."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "Greetings, Lord Diulei!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong smiled with his teeth. He just clasped his fists: "So you're the Lord Diulei that Zhuo told me about, and you're younger than I thought."</p>

    <p>"Brother Qin's matter. Brother Wang Ming has already relayed it to me via brainwave. Since we all have the same goal now. After the matter of this Virtual Realm is settled, I will definitely find a way to help Brother Qin return to the original world." Lord Diulei said confidently.</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun said so. Of course I believe it unconditionally. And I feel that I have a good rapport with you. It seems like this is not the first time I've met you."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong still said with a smile on his face: "It's actually not that urgent to go back, because I found it quite interesting here."</p>

    <p>Hearing Qin Zhong's response, Lord Diulei was temporarily relieved.</p>

    <p>In fact, he already roughly knew Qin Zhong's identity.</p>

    <p>It's just because I made an agreement with someone. So it's not revealed directly.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please sit down. We are all brothers. There is no need to be formal." Lord Diulei raised his hand and motioned for everyone to sit down. As always, he followed the friendly line. There was no air of being a sect leader at all.</p>

    <p>Seeing Lord Diulei's attitude. Zhuo Yi also vaguely seemed to have noticed something.</p>

    <p>He felt that Lord Diulei seemed to know Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>And we know the origin of this lucky man.</p>

    <p>In the tavern, after being immersed in it for a few seconds, Lord Diulei said: "To be honest, I'll tell you this. Just when I, the death-seeking senior, had just started to gain fame, I noticed that there was such a mysterious barrier in the Arctic Circle. It's just that I wasn't sophisticated enough at that time to explore here."</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun has known it for a long time?" This answer surprised Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Lord Diulei nodded and said, "I realized at that time that this was a big chess game. But at that time, with my limited personal strength, I probably couldn't get involved in this matter."</p>

    <p>"But within the Arctic Circle, there is such a mysterious country established in a special barrier that is unknown to the world... This is always a hidden danger."</p>

    <p>"And the most important thing is that the founder of this mysterious country did not take any unnecessary actions.</p>

    <p>In order not to alert others, I have no choice but to conceal this matter. "I just didn't expect that Shou Chong. He actually has a special connection with the founder of this mysterious country."</p>

    <p>"Since Zhenjun already knows that there are hidden dangers in this place, then according to Zhenjun's personality, have you placed spies for surveillance and layout?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course there is. And for this matter, I also specifically searched for Brother Gu." Lord Diulei said: "Brother Gu recommended me as a person, so that he could successfully blend into this world."</p>

    <p>In fact, the person he wanted to find at first was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, because Wang Ling was really troubled by too many things at that time, he was unable to open his mouth for a time. So he later found Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was the first to hear Lord Diulei tell the whole story of this incident before everyone else here.</p>

    <p>After he finished listening, there was an old feeling in his heart that he didn't know whether to vomit or not.</p>

    <p>He felt that Zhenjun was still too naive sometimes.</p>

    <p>His Little Master Lingzi. I don't know what's going on...</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhuo Yi nodded after hearing this.</p>

    <p>After all, Gu Shunzhi is an orderer. An official to correct the order of the universe. He is an orthodox messenger sent by Heavenly Dao. It is not surprising to know this.</p>

    <p>But now they are curious about who this person recommended by Gu Shunzhi is.</p>

    <p>"So who is the person recommended by Senior Gu?" Zhuo Yi was curious.</p>

    <p>While talking, he noticed a somewhat abnormal expression on Qin Zhong's face.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. He seems to be a little sensitive to the word "Senior Gu."</p>

    <p>"This man has a special history. Maybe you haven't heard of him. He started out as a junk collector. The junkyard where you Zhuo Yi brothers showed up earlier. That's what he did after he got in. He's the one who runs the business."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said with a smile: "According to legend, this senior originally rose from a wasteland world of cultivation. But just before you came here, this senior's true form had already returned."</p>

    <p>"True body? What does true king mean."</p>

    <p>"After all, I have entrusted him to keep an eye on me here for a while. Although he was promised a lot of benefits, I still have to let others go home and have a look." Lord Diulei explained: "So before I came, I found Brother Ling myself. Entrust Nuan Zhenren to leave the shadow of this senior."</p>

    <p>"Hey! There is such an operation..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took a breath of air: "But isn't the shadow's personality completely opposite to the main body?"</p>

    <p>"It cannot be said to be completely the opposite." Lord Diulei said: "Shadow is just the inner expression of most people. If a person's inner and outer appearance are similar, the differentiated shadow will not actually be much different. You guys Just treat him as his true form. The shadow of this senior is very obedient. He will try his best to act as the true form of that senior."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Lord Diulei clapped his hands.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, a man slowly walked out from the back kitchen of the tavern.</p>

    <p>When this person opened the curtain that blocked the kitchen, everyone finally saw his appearance clearly. He was a handsome and handsome young man. He looked about the same age as Wang Ling. But his expression showed that His perseverance makes people feel that this person is a bit young and mature.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a pair of overalls and was carrying a long, black cloth bag. It looked a bit like a cello case.</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun...is this senior a musician?" Zhou Ziyi raised her hand obediently.</p>

    <p>"Musician? My sister is. I am not." The visitor smiled modestly. He took off the big black bag behind him and placed it on the ground. He patted it gently and said, "It's in here." But it's my spiritual sword."</p>

    <p>"Spirit sword?"</p>

    <p>With that said, the boy unbuckled the black bag and opened the zipper.</p>

    <p>Without using magic like clairvoyance, almost no one would have imagined that inside this package, which looked like it contained a large musical instrument, it turned out to be a fiery red high-power sniper rifle...</p>

    <p>"Hello everyone. Allow me to introduce to you my Nine Sun Divine Sword." The young man said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"What's your senior's name?" Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Me?"</p>

    <p>He quickly suppressed his playful expression. His eyes flashed: "My name is Xiang Yi."</p>

    <p>Don't know why.</p>

    <p>After the visitor expresses his or her name.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi, and even Lord Diulei... these people who originally lived in this local modern world of cultivation, at this moment, they all suddenly had an illusion of intertwining time and space.</p>
