  <h1>Chapter 1662 A mistake</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although this group of people were wearing masks and cloaks, when they passed by the carriage, Zhuo Yi still radiated a hint of coldness from under the cloak. They noticed that one of them was Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>He was covered in cold sweat and fell down on the spot. This made Qin Zhong very nervous for a while. His intention was just to make a joke. He did not really intend to meet Jiugong Liangzi on the road.</p>

    <p>As a result, he didn't expect that luck would be used in such a place. He hit the nail on the head.</p>

    <p>Of course. Qin Zhong never expected that Zhuo Yi would be so afraid. It seems that in all likelihood he will be a strict wife in the future.</p>

    <p>In the car. A few people did not disturb Sun Rong and the others, but quietly gave the driver some money when the carriage passed a certain alley. They told him to follow Sun Rong and the others quietly.</p>

    <p>This move was made by Zhuo Yi after he mustered up the courage. Although he currently only dares to let the groom follow him secretly...</p>

    <p>Mainly because he didn't know what drastic action would happen if Liangzi discovered him.</p>

    <p>The purpose of their trip to the astrology club was also to find the remaining two groups as soon as possible to avoid an own incident. As a result, they bumped into Jiugong Liangzi on the way there. It was like giving him a pillow when he fell asleep.</p>

    <p>Originally Zhuo Yi thought that the mobile phone signal would not work in such a "different world space." But after the incident in the circle of friends just now, Zhuo Yi suddenly became enlightened.</p>

    <p>He immediately edited two messages and sent them to Lord Diulei, telling them their current location information and the situation where Jiugong Liangzi was found.</p>

    <p>The other message was sent to Li Xian and Zhang Zhui...</p>

    <p>However, for these two eternal seniors, it would be more reliable to let Lord Diulei physically notify them.</p>

    <p>Comparatively, the two of them have just come into contact with modern things like mobile phones. They are not particularly skilled in the above operations. It is inevitable that there will be some surprises.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief. He quietly opened the curtains beside the carriage and secretly looked at Jiugong Liangzi and others hurriedly walking outside the window with one eye.</p>

    <p>"What are they going to do?" Zhuo Yi muttered: "And it seems that they even changed masks with Liangzi. Are they afraid that Liangzi will be targeted? Do you want to protect Liangzi's safety?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's words were enough inspiration. Qin Zhong touched his chin and suddenly said: "Martial Arts Competition in the underground boxing ring. It is nearly six million gold gear coins and a pass. And my sister-in-law's The employer is the police chief Ducas. He came here just for the pass. So how did my sister-in-law and the three of them get the passes?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhou Ziyi nodded at the side: "Even if the director gives all the bonuses to sister-in-law Liangzi, a core area communication certificate with a market value of 20 million gold gear coins is still not enough to buy."</p>

    <p>"bingo! So the only explanation is that someone sponsored them."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong snapped his fingers and said with a calm expression: "The person most likely to sponsor is the boxing ring operator Zhu Yuanrun."</p>

    <p>"Is it because senior Jin Deng took action to save him from Hei Long?" Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>Judging from Zhu Yuanrun's hostility towards them at the beginning, he felt that this person was not so particular and kind-hearted.</p>

    <p>And such a cunning person who tried every means to use unfair means to trip up the competition would actually admit defeat so generously.</p>

    <p>This also made Zhuo Yi vaguely feel that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Brother Zhuo thinks the same as me. They both think this Zhu Yuanrun is not a good person."</p>

    <p>On the carriage, Qin Zhong folded his arms and analyzed: "In the final analysis, this Zhu Yuanrun is just a capitalist who makes no profit and cannot afford to be early. Such a person? It is impossible to do money-losing business. So the extra pass should be someone who can help this." Zhu Yuanrun kept it secret. He wanted to lure the enemy deep enough to lure them over."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Zhou Ziyi heard this? Everyone fell into silence and thinking.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Qin Zhong's calm analysis makes everything sound so reasonable and reasonable. It can almost be described as impeccable.</p>

    <p>Of course? Regarding the above conclusion, Qin Zhong himself is not very sure: "Ah, this is just my opinion? Brother Zhuo and Brother Ziyi can just listen to it? They may also be confused."</p>

    <p>"Confused? How can a koi be confused?" Zhuo Yi smiled inwardly.</p>

    <p>In fact, Qin Zhong did not confess his true identity to Zhuo Yi at all. But Zhuo Yi already regarded him as a koi in his heart... everything was so natural.</p>

    <p>At this moment? The carriage's wheels stopped again.</p>

    <p>The groom driving in front opened the curtain and said: "My lords, is this area in front of a private house? The carriage cannot enter. I see that the adults you are chasing have already entered through the entrance of the house first."</p>

    <p>"Okay? Thank you." Zhuo Yi nodded? Immediately, several people got out of the car.</p>

    <p>As the groom said, what caught the eyes of Zhuo Yi and others was a gorgeous mansion with carved beams and painted beams. Various patterns of ancient mechanical beasts were carved on them. It perfectly integrated the style of this world, including the door. A plaque decorated with neon lights. The word "Defu" is written on the flashing and dancing lights.</p>

    <p>"Is this the director's residence?" Zhuo Yi stood at the door and was stunned. Then he walked back and walked in, following Jiugong Liangzi and others.</p>

    <p>His intuition has always been accurate.</p>

    <p>I feel like something bad is going to happen.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi clearly knows that with Monk Jin Deng here, there will be no problem no matter how great the danger is.</p>

    <p>But in the end, you still have to protect your own woman.</p>

    <p>This is what a real boyfriend should look like.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The troops were divided into two groups. On the other carriage? Lord Diulei and others who entered the core city as servants successfully received the news from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough. Zhuo Yi brothers are very lucky. Not long after entering the city, they bumped into Miss Rong and Miss Liangzi." Lord Diulei said with a smile.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had expected this result.</p>

    <p>After all, he is beside Zhuo Yi. But following the only koi in the world of cultivation...</p>

    <p>"Then do we still want to go to the astrology club now?" Xiang Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"We still have to go. A large number of dignitaries flock there every week to divine astrology and personal luck. Although finding two people in this imperial city is like finding a needle in a haystack, it is not as difficult as imagined."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded and said. He used brain waves to convey the location of the astrology club to the minds of the rest of the people.</p>

    <p>This is a real-time map. The flashing red moving light point is their current position. The astrology club at the end is marked with a yellow star. It is clear at a glance.</p>

    <p>"It's actually this astrology club?"</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi was stunned when he saw the mark on the map.</p>

    <p>"What? Have you been there?" Er Ha asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Yes! It's a coincidence. I actually run a tobacco, alcohol and snack shop next to that astrology club. I'm the boss behind that shop. And today is the day to sell special products!"</p>

    <p>"Special sale items?"</p>

    <p>"All kinds of snacks. Limited edition figs, limited edition lollipops, limited edition bubble halls, limited edition crispy noodles and the like... these gadgets. Those powerful people may not look down on them. But those But the children of rich and powerful people are very happy to buy them. They often go to collect cards for snacks and carry boxes and boxes to their homes."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi laughed: "Sure enough, it's better to make money from children. Otherwise, how do you think I got the 60 million gold gear coins?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After hearing this, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Limited Edition Crispy Noodles...</p>

    <p>Or a different world version of limited edition noodles...</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception had a feeling at this time.</p>

    <p>Maybe.</p>

    <p>That man...</p>

    <p>Coming...</p>
