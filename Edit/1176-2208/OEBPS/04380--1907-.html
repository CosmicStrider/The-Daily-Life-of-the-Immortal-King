  <h1>Chapter 1907 Wang Ling finally takes action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Peng Beicen refused to use the magic weapon he gave her, which made Peng Xiren's head hurt.</p>

    <p>It was a golden round elixir. This was how Peng Xiren introduced it to Peng Beicen when he sent it over.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, Peng Xiren himself knew very well that this was not a pill at all, but an insect cyst obtained from the palace of the outer gods in the old world.</p>

    <p>He has been communicating with the power of the old world, trying to control the world of eternal cultivation through the old world. But at the same time, Peng Xiren is a cautious person.</p>

    <p>So he thought of many ways to test this power.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren remembers that he conducted two experiments on insect cysts in total.</p>

    <p>For the first time, he threw the worm cyst into a glass of clean water. As a result, the powerful energy of the worm cyst directly turned the cup of clean water into a cup of cosmic liquid with high concentration of energy...</p>

    <p>He did not dare to drink it directly. Instead, he poured the original liquid on a dying spiritual plant. As a result, the spiritual plant not only quickly resurrected, but also transformed into a terrifying rattan. It also gained very terrifying energy.</p>

    <p>Not only that. This low-level rattan actually has wisdom. He calls himself "Ito."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren had never seen this situation before. So he made a decisive decision and cut off Ito before it fully developed.</p>

    <p>The second time, he conducted the experiment on a long-legged insect named Qiao Ben. As a result, the long-legged insect received a huge energy gain. It also completed "evolution" on the original basis and became a kind of terrifying creature between the world of cultivation and the old world.</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that the Qiaoben long-legged insect used for the experiment obviously did not adapt to the huge energy brought by the insect cyst. Peng Xiren didn't even take action. Qiaoben tripped to the ground due to his own long legs. The huge energy in its body fell heavily to the ground at that moment. The huge impact directly detonated the energy. In the end, not even fly ash was left.</p>

    <p>At that time, Peng Xiren was sighing. If this Qiaoben long-legged insect can survive successfully, with this terrible growth ability, he is afraid it will not be surprising to be called a "genius" in the long-legged insect world.</p>

    <p>However, Peng Xiren has never conducted experiments on humans.</p>

    <p>From the results of the previous two experiments, he judged that the insect cyst indeed had the powerful ability to become stronger. It could even allow living beings to evolve.</p>

    <p>However, the energy brought by the insect cysts is definitely not something that anyone can withstand. He has already experimented with two insect cysts, and now he still has two left in his hand.</p>

    <p>In other words, if he wants to take the insect cyst, he will have an additional opportunity to experiment.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of blood relationship and combat prowess, Peng Xiren believes that Peng Beicen is the most suitable candidate.</p>

    <p>If Peng Beicen has any sequelae after swallowing the worm cyst, it should be the closest and most intuitive to him. In this way, after he swallows the worm cyst himself, he can be prepared in advance and take precautions.</p>

    <p>The scene returned to the battle scene. After several consecutive battle defeats, Peng Beicen's confidence obviously dropped to a low point.</p>

    <p>She never thought why a servant was so difficult to deal with...</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen didn't want to get married at all. The reason for holding this large-scale son-in-law recruitment ceremony was that she wanted the man she liked to have some awareness of her.</p>

    <p>Although Peng Beicen knew very well that due to their awkward blood relationship, becoming a Taoist couple was destined to be nonsense. However, as a girl, she still expected to see the man she liked jealous of her.</p>

    <p>But it was a pity that these people had already reached the door. That man still chose to observe the battle in secret.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen knew. The man gave her a golden pill.</p>

    <p>If she swallows it, she has a high probability of winning.</p>

    <p>But now Peng Beicen doesn't want to do that.</p>

    <p>She was looking forward to being injured. She was even looking forward to seeing a scene where Peng Xiren could come to rescue her after she was injured.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that all this seems to be just her wishful thinking.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen once had a little fantasy. She thought that Peng Xiren would be interested in her. She was even willing to go through the most cruel "blood refining array" for Peng Xiren, so that her blood would be completely replaced from beginning to end. It would have absolutely nothing to do with the Peng family.</p>

    <p>But now Peng Beicen found out. After all, she paid by mistake.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to consider your master and hold back on me. After fighting for a long time, I just wasted my spiritual energy for no reason. This kind of battle is not interesting to me at all. And it is also disrespectful to me." After the last sword fight, Peng Beicen and Emperor Dong quickly distanced themselves from each other. She stood at the frozen waterfall in the distance, emitting an extremely cold air from her whole body.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen is not stupid. She knows that the victory pill that Peng Xiren gave her must have its own purpose.</p>

    <p>She didn't know the origin of this "elixir." She just believed that the man she liked would not use this elixir to harm herself.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Peng Xiren is hesitant to take action. She herself is no match for Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen didn't want to get married like this. So in despair, she took out the golden insect cyst.</p>

    <p>"Finally. Is it about to begin..." Peng Xiren was overjoyed when he saw this scene. He had been waiting for a long time just for this moment.</p>

    <p>When Peng Beicen put the insect cyst into her mouth, it could be clearly seen that the muscles and veins all over her body were exploding. The traces of blood flow could be clearly seen through her fair and jade-like skin.</p>

    <p>This is the power from the old world. Wang Ling felt it at this moment.</p>

    <p>Before, he could clearly feel that Peng Beicen was hesitating whether to swallow the worm cyst. And it was obvious that she was kept in the dark. She had no idea what the worm cyst was... But at this moment, she had already taken the worm cyst. The worm cyst was completely swallowed into the stomach.</p>

    <p>In an instant, her fair skin was covered as densely as a spider web by the muscles that exploded wantonly. In a very short period of time, even her body turned into jet black color. She roared in pain. Her jet black hair looked like a wild beast. Hier hair grew massively at this moment.</p>

    <p>The breath and combat power are continuously superimposed under the action of the insect sac.</p>

    <p>At this time, Emperor Dongda was completely stunned. When he fought with the Sun Goddess before, even if the Sun Goddess swallowed the pill given by Emperor Xi, she would not gain such a terrifying speed. But now Peng Beicen only swallowed one pill. That's it. This combat power is increasing rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>In just ten seconds, she has reached the level of Heavenly Ancestor.</p>

    <p>"She's been changed." At this moment, Wang Ying finally couldn't bear it anymore and said directly.</p>

    <p>The current situation is obviously beyond the ability of Emperor Dongda to handle it.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ying spoke directly.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling, who has been silent, is already ready to go.</p>

    <p>Her brother should be there to feel sorry for her.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, damned people like Peng Xiren...should be sent directly to hell!</p>
