  <h1>Chapter 1399 3 Unlucky Guys</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Here Bai Qiao has finished introducing the basic situation. Sun Rong also has a general understanding of the three sword spirits in front of him: "I have met three seniors!"</p>

    <p>Carter, Wu Jin and Lao Man, who were called by their seniors, all felt frightened. They felt a little ashamed.</p>

    <p>"Just call Miss Sun by name. There is no need to call us seniors... we are born from the universe. It's just a coincidence that we are older than Miss Sun. In terms of debate ability, we should call Miss Sun senior." Wu Jin said politely.</p>

    <p>"Senior, do you know me?"Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>Because Bai Qiao did not introduce her identity.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun is so famous now. At least in the circle of sword spirits like us who follow Master Jingke and Master Bai Qiao. Everyone knows Miss Sun's name." Wu Jin answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong's name can be so loud. In fact, it has some connection with Aohai.</p>

    <p>Just like Wu Jin said. Sword spirits are all born from the universe.</p>

    <p>Including Aohai. The same is true.</p>

    <p>"All the swords in the world return to their clan. They all come out of the Sword King Realm. This sentence means that the Sword King Realm is the origin of all sword spirits. This sentence is correct. However, strictly speaking, not all sword spirits are the hometown. Sword King Realm." Wu Jin introduced the origin of Sword Spirit to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>He gave an example.</p>

    <p>For example, Aohai is actually a native sword spirit bred on earth.</p>

    <p>And sword spirits like this that were not bred in the Sword King Realm are actually the descendants of those sword spirits that escaped from the Sword King Realm...</p>

    <p>As for the relationship between Wang Ling and Jingke, it belongs to the mutual resonance between the strong and the strong.</p>

    <p>After Jingke escaped from the Sword King Realm, he fell into a deep sleep for a long time without choosing his master.</p>

    <p>Because. No one can be worthy of it.</p>

    <p>Until the birth of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Sword Spirits and Sword Spirits can also have children. However, they adopt the mechanism of asexual reproduction. After two Sword Spirits look at each other, they can enter each other's chaos. Then the universe will give birth to a new Sword Spirit."</p>

    <p>Wu Jin patiently explained, "Of course. Like Lord Jingke and Lord Bai Qiao. It is obviously a sword. But the sword body and the scabbard at the same time give birth to the existence of 'spirit'. There can't be another one in the entire Sword King Realm."</p>

    <p>Having said this, he couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>

    <p>A sword like this that has been paired with a wife since she was born. Four words to describe it are "skeleton amazing."</p>

    <p>A new sword spirit bred from a sword spirit and a sword spirit. It will not appear in the Sword King Realm when it is born.</p>

    <p>Instead, he will choose his sword master from within the universe based on his own characteristics.</p>

    <p>Therefore, many of the so-called sword spirits born on earth are not from the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>It's just that my parents belong to the sword king world.</p>

    <p>Since the sword spirit was not born in the Sword King Realm, the quality of the sword spirit will of course be different.</p>

    <p>The quality of the sword spirits bred in the Sword King Realm is beyond imagination.</p>

    <p>That's why there is news that many upper-level cultivators try their best to come to the Sword King Realm to hunt for swords, but then fall into the outer blade storm...</p>

    <p>"If they are all sword spirits that come from the Sword King Realm, from a genetic point of view, the quality of the new sword spirits bred by these sword spirits should not be too bad." Er Ha frowned. He felt like he had discovered something. Something incredible.</p>

    <p>"Sword Spirits and Sword Spirits also need to be matched. If they are mixed and matched, the quality will naturally not be too high. For example, it is obviously a big sword, but you find a short dagger or something like that..." Wu Jin said.</p>

    <p>"That's it." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that most of the local sword spirits in the Sword King Realm actually look down on non-pure hybrids from other places.</p>

    <p>"Now Miss Sun knows why you and Miss Aohai are so famous now?"</p>

    <p>Wu Jin said with a wry smile.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Her Aohai is not a local spirit sword from the Sword King Realm. But now, because it is fused with two Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes, its combat power has soared!</p>

    <p>Directly ranked eighth on the Sword King Realm Sword Ranking!</p>

    <p>A non-purebred Sword Spirit can actually do this. This is undoubtedly a hard hammer to these Sword King Realm Sword Spirits!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er smiled: "I really want to know who the three unlucky guys who were kicked off the list are."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao looked at Sun Ying'er expressionlessly: "It's just the three of them."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Before Aohai was upgraded, Carter, Wu Jin and Lao Man were originally ranked eighth, ninth and tenth respectively.</p>

    <p>Now that Aohai has arrived, Carter's position has been replaced and he has become ninth.</p>

    <p>Wu Jin became tenth.</p>

    <p>And the most unlucky person is Lao Man...</p>

    <p>He was directly knocked out of the top ten list and is struggling in the eleventh place.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Carter took Sun Rong and a group of people and began to shuttle through the intricate magic circles of the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, they finally arrived at Sword Capital, located in the center of the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>The third Rubik's Cube is in Sword City.</p>

    <p>This is the largest capital city in the entire Sword King Realm. The tall metal city walls exude a simple charm.</p>

    <p>According to Wu Jin's introduction, all the buildings in the Sword King Realm are made from the sword spirits that failed to attack the Blade Storm.</p>

    <p>After the impact of those sword spirits fails, they will forever change into the original form and lose their luster. This indicates that the sword spirit in the sword body has died, and the sword body has become a material that can be reused.</p>

    <p>"That broken sword on the edge of the Sword Sea. Why not recycle it?" Sun Ying'er asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"It has become a tourist attraction now. There will be objections if it is recycled at will. Moreover, this sword is too big. It will not be easy to recycle it." Wu Jin said.</p>

    <p>When passing by the city gate, several sword spirits stationed in front of the city gate bowed to Wu Jin and Carter: "Master Wu Jin! Master Carter!"</p>

    <p>Then they saw Bai Qiao following Wu Jin. They were so frightened that they broke out in cold sweat. They knelt down on the spot and said, "Bai... Master Bai Qiao..."</p>

    <p>"Everyone, get up." Bai Qiao nodded as usual.</p>

    <p>A group of people passed by the city gate.</p>

    <p>Then Sun Ying'er's words pierced Lao Man's heart on the spot: "Speaking of which, why didn't they call you?"</p>

    <p>"I... I'm not worthy..." Lao Man's heart was bleeding. The expression on his face looked extremely painful.</p>

    <p>When a tree falls, the hozens scatter, and when a wall falls, everyone pushes against it. This is also true in the world of sword kings.</p>

    <p>Lao Man. What a miserable man.</p>

    <p>"Is the Rubik's Cube situation still stable now?" Sun Rong asked on the way.</p>

    <p>"Back to Miss Sun, the current situation of the Rubik's Cube is still very stable. Because there are currently no missing cubes, the probability of riots has been reduced a lot. However, it is safer to replace it with a new Rubik's Cube as soon as possible." Wu Jin replied.</p>

    <p>A group of people walked on Central Street, attracting the attention of many sword spirits around. But no one dared to discuss it in the street because Bai Qiao's aura was too strong.</p>

    <p>"By the way, who is the manager of Jiandu now?" Bai Qiao asked.</p>

    <p>She hasn't been back for a while. I don't know the situation.</p>

    <p>"It's Jiu You." Carter replied.</p>

    <p>"Oh. It turns out to be that boy." Bai Qiao suddenly knew.</p>

    <p>"Who is Jiu You?"Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"A serrated sword. Currently ranked fifth on the sword list. The custodian of the Sword City."</p>

    <p>"Is it really an escrow..."</p>

    <p>"Of course it's escrow!"</p>

    <p>When Bai Qiao said this, the expression on his face suddenly became a little proud: "Ha. The world in Jiandu is all decided by the one on the list!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sword King Realm Sword Ranking (currently only the mentioned ones are listed):</p>

    <p>First: Jingke, Bai Qiao</p>

    <p>Second: Preliminary</p>

    <p>Fifth: Jiu You</p>

    <p>Eighth:Aohai</p>

    <p>Ninth:Carter</p>

    <p>Tenth:Wu Jin</p>

    <p>Eleven:Lao Man</p>
