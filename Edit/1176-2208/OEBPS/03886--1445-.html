  <h1>Chapter 1445 What are the factors for taking the blame?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo YiUnexpectedly, Jiugong Liangzi transferred to Number 60 High School for his own sake.</p>

    <p>And he... actually offended the entire Jiugong family?</p>

    <p>This makes Zhuo Yi feel a little incredible.</p>

    <p>In fact, doubts about the large-scale disaster that suddenly struck the Gate to Another World six years ago have always existed in Huaxiu. And Zhuo Yi is not the first time to face such doubts.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's number one disciple and the player who takes the blame, Zhuo Yi's psychological quality has long been tempered to the point where it can even deceive a lie detector.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Facing Jiugong's questioning, Zhuo Yi just smiled. There was no wave in his heart.</p>

    <p>He skillfully operated the tea set on the principal's desk. He made a cup of tea for Jiugong and handed it over: "I don't know why Jiugong said that. What happened six years ago should have been settled long ago."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi smelled the aroma of tea leaves and soaking in hot water. The angry mood in his heart when he saw Zhuo Yi seemed to suddenly ease a lot.</p>

    <p>"Ha. Who wants to drink the tea brewed by a liar like you?"</p>

    <p>Even though he said this, he still reached out and took the tea cup.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiugong, everything must be based on evidence. I don't know why the Jiugong family hates me so much. But if there is any misunderstanding, I think it would be better to explain it clearly as soon as possible."Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He sat down opposite Jiugong. At the same time, he was also observing Jiugong's expression.</p>

    <p>This is an icy beauty. The expression on her face never fluctuates or changes at all.</p>

    <p>Emotions are not directly reflected in expressions.</p>

    <p>This feeling makes Zhuo Yi somewhat familiar.</p>

    <p>After all, his master is also such a person...</p>

    <p>"Liar. Do you think I really can't produce evidence?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi took a sip of tea and stared at Zhuo Yi with his purple eyes: "Although the matter is far away, our Jiugong family did find an eyewitness at the scene after many efforts. And this person Witnesses said that the person who defeated the Demon King at that time was a boy with dead fish eyes."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Jiugong Liangzi paused.</p>

    <p>Speaking of the topic of "dead fish eyes"... She remembered that she had seen a dead fish eye not long ago.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why. There was a shortage of memory in my mind. I couldn't remember it all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>However, these are not the key.</p>

    <p>The key is that she came to Huaxiu this time and chose to enroll in Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>From the beginning, she came here for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The first is to expose this liar. The second is to use this topic to open up Jiugong's domestic market in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>"You said. Eyewitness?" These words made Zhuo Yi slightly stunned.</p>

    <p>The scene at that time was really messy. There was dust and smoke raised by the collapse of buildings and thick smoke from various explosions.</p>

    <p>He started to join the team and rescued many people. It had already been confirmed that the core area where Er Ha landed had been evacuated. There would be no third person.</p>

    <p>So, where did this witness come from?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi did not give in. Instead, he took out the "evidence" he had prepared in advance from the small bag.</p>

    <p>That was a photo. And what shocked Zhuo Yi was that it was actually an "animated picture"...</p>

    <p>"Can GIFs be printed now?"Zhuo Yi stared at the photo in disbelief.</p>

    <p>"This is a digital camera photo seal. The person sealed in this photo is the witness of our Jiugong family." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stares at this photo.</p>

    <p>I found that the photo was of a little girl wearing a light yellow skirt. The little girl was only about five or six years old. She was knitting a sweater in the photo.</p>

    <p>"A...Day-traveling ghost?"Zhuo Yi stared at the photo for a few seconds. Finally, he noticed the clues in it.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that the witness Jiugong Liangzi mentioned would be a "Day-traveling ghost."</p>

    <p>"You don't seem so useless."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is not surprised that Zhuo Yi can see it. But he can directly identify the type of ghost with just a sealed photo. This is definitely an expert's sight.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family has been exorcising demons for generations.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong still hates Zhuo Yi as a liar. But I have to say that Zhuo Yi seems to be much better than her brothers who failed to live up to expectations.</p>

    <p>This made Jiugong Liangzi feel a little embarrassed and angry. He then said to Zhuo Yi: "But I think a liar like you, who is used to grabbing honors, should have special training in exorcism and exorcism." Knowledge."</p>

    <p>"If she is just a five- or six-year-old girl, can Jiugong believe it?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled calmly: "She said that the one who defeated Thuntihan Ha was a boy. How old was the boy at that time?"</p>

    <p>"Ten years old." Jiugong Liangzi replied.</p>

    <p>"Ten years old. No matter how talented a cultivator is, at this age, he is only a Golden Core. A Golden Core. Can he defeat the Demon King?" Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"Weren't you also a Golden Core at that time?" Jiugong Liangzi asked back.</p>

    <p>"I said it. Thuntihan Ha at that time was already very weak after repeated attacks. So I just went to make up for the last blow."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi retorted: "I have clarified this point with many media. As for the media's increasingly outrageous rumors about the Thousand Miles of Air Sword and so on...those are indeed exaggerated."</p>

    <p>However, when faced with Zhuo Yi's explanation, Jiugong Liangzi didn't buy it.</p>

    <p>"It's just your clever words."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi laughed: "Let me tell you another thing. The Day-traveling ghost girl in this photo looks like she is only five or six years old. But that's because she was this age when she died. That's why her appearance was fixed. Xiao Huang appeared in that area thirty years ago. In other words, her mind is actually that of an adult."</p>

    <p>"I know what you want to say."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi answered: "Jiugong wants to say that what this Day-traveling ghost said is actually legally binding, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Liar."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi raised his lips and said, "So, are you panicking?"</p>

    <p>"Not really." Zhuo Yi shrugged indifferently.</p>

    <p>"I know. Just relying on the words of a Day-traveling ghost is not enough. So I have to find the boy that the Day-traveling ghost witnessed back then."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi stood up and took a step forward while holding on to the table.</p>

    <p>Her purple eyes stared at Zhuo Yi. The two of them closed the distance almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "According to the speculations of our Jiugong family, you have repeatedly made extraordinary achievements in recent years. Many incidents may seem irrelevant, but in fact they are all closely related to Number 60 High School. So we have reason to doubt. Maybe that Maybe the boy is studying at Number 60 High School!"</p>

    <p>They're too close, and from this angle, coincidentally, they're facing towards ...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi tilted his head slightly. Pretending he didn't see anything: "Jiugong, you are too close."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi quickly stood up and covered himself: "You...you pervert!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was instantly dissatisfied: "Then I have to be able to see it! You don't even have that, Jiugong. What kind of pervert am I?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</p>

    <p>Then she quickly opened the office door and prepared to leave.</p>

    <p>Only a cold figure was left for Zhuo Yi: "You wait for Zhuo Yi. We'll see."</p>

    <p>"Registration procedures. I will handle it for classmate Jiugong. Good luck, classmate Jiugong." Zhuo Yi smiled and nodded.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Then, the office door was closed instantly.</p>

    <p>After seeing Jiugong Liangzi disappear, Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>This young lady from abroad.</p>

    <p>It's a bit difficult...</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi glanced at the lever on his thumb.</p>

    <p>This ring is one of the magic weapons given to him by Wang Ling. It is called "Fake Heart Ring." It is also known as "Substitute Heart Ring."</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, it is a ring that can replace the heart using space. The heart in Zhuo Yi's body is a fake heart created by the Heart Replacement Ring. The real heart is sealed in the "Replacement Heart Ring" Li.</p>

    <p>The heart is a critical part. The function of the heart substitute ring was originally to insure the heart.</p>

    <p>But it's different if you put it here Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Because the heartbeat of the fake heart doesn't belong to him...</p>

    <p>So. This is one of the important reasons why Zhuo Yi can remain calm in the face of questioning, thus deceiving those "lie detector magic weapons."</p>

    <p>But in fact, the real heart sealed in the "Substitute Heart Ring" space has a very high heart rate...</p>

    <p>When Jiugong Liangzi just approached, Zhuo Yi could clearly feel his heartbeat intensifying under the other party's continuous questioning.</p>
