  <h1>Chapter 1848 Negotiations Collapse</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yan Sanyang's words seemed to be respectful, but in fact they contained a kind of contempt. He did not take the Emperor Dongda in front of him seriously at all. He was very confident in his heart. He was obviously prepared.</p>

    <p>Because he is not the only one who is on an envoy to the Eastern Region this time. At this moment, the envoys composed of the commanders of the Western Emperor are waiting outside the Eastern Emperor's Palace in an orderly manner. Dozens of elders, all the elite of the elite.</p>

    <p>Every single one has infinite potential. They are the leading geniuses among the ranks of the Eternals. If they can get enough resources, they will definitely become a powerful person in the future. They can even form a tribe to compete for the position of emperor.</p>

    <p>Such a terrible sense of oppression is like a dark cloud covering the sun. The water surrounding the Dongda Imperial Palace is sealed. It seems as if it will pour in all the time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already noticed this danger when he was on the wall of the Imperial Palace. He had the mentality of watching a show. He didn't know how the Eastern Emperor would deal with it. It was even less clear whether the Eastern Emperor had noticed what was going on outside.</p>

    <p>This is a group of terrifying Eternals. Each of them has the power to destroy a tribe at will. It has become a symbol of the watershed between the strength of the East and the West.</p>

    <p>In the Eastern Region Imperial Palace, on the supreme Suzaku throne, the Eastern Emperor remained motionless. It was as if he had expected the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>His eyes showed stability and confidence. He glanced at Yan Sanyang, the ambassador from the Western Regions. There was a red bird fire around him. His eyes were scorching, giving people a strong sense of intimidation.</p>

    <p>However, Yan Sanyang knew that there was still a lot of backup standing behind him. Even though he was being stared at, he was frightened, but he still had the courage to say: "I hope the Eastern Emperor clearly knows how important this truce agreement is to the Eastern Region. This agreement will ensure that our two regions will have good relations and will not interfere with each other for at least a hundred years. It will also give the Eastern Region some opportunities to rest and recuperate."</p>

    <p>"If the Eastern Emperor refuses to accept my Western Emperor's love, then what will happen next? The Eastern Emperor had better be prepared."</p>

    <p>He put his hands behind his back and said domineeringly. After all, he lost all his patience in the imperial palace and showed a ferocious look.</p>

    <p>"Yan Sanyang. Are you threatening my king?" Ye Ren, the white-robed manager, scolded. He couldn't hold it back. The laws of his body surged and auras emerged. He had the urge to kill Yan Sanyang quickly.</p>

    <p>At this time, the atmosphere in the imperial palace suddenly cooled down. The two sides facing each other were at war with each other. They looked like they would start fighting at any time.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, the Eastern Emperor suddenly laughed: "Ye Ren, please be patient."</p>

    <p>Immediately, he stood up from the supreme throne. With a look of disdain, he glanced at Yan Sanyang condescendingly: "The Western Emperor is so interested in the abandoned palace of the outer gods that I discovered?"</p>

    <p>"It's natural."</p>

    <p>Yan Sanyang snorted and said.</p>

    <p>"Suppose I say that in this palace of the outer gods, I discovered a mysterious thing that can directly destroy an entire region. Do you Western Regions still dare to touch me?" Emperor Dongda narrowed his eyes slightly. There was a hint of ruthlessness on his face. color.</p>

    <p>Such an expression made Yan Sanyang sweat immediately.</p>

    <p>Because this is what the Western Emperor is most worried about...</p>

    <p>The Palace of the Outer Gods is the transformation of the Outer Gods, the top powerhouse in the Old Dominator. It embodies all the power of the Outer Gods. Although it is called the tomb of the Outer Gods, it is actually the soul essence of the Outer Gods. If you can successfully explore it, you can find it. You will definitely get unimaginable benefits...</p>

    <p>However, apart from those emperor-level figures and Dao Ancestor Wang, there are probably no other Eternals who dare to break into the Palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>The Western Emperor was obsessed with this Palace of the Outer Gods and wanted to capture it. The most important reason was that he was worried that the Eastern Emperor would get into the Palace of the Outer Gods alone and get something that he couldn't deal with.</p>

    <p>The power of those outer gods is powerful. Even if they are dead, the objects in the palace are still astonishingly powerful.</p>

    <p>Therefore, what Emperor Dongda said about destroying a region was not a joke. The most likely result is... to die together.</p>

    <p>In just a few words, Yan Sanyang was choked to the point of speaking.</p>

    <p>But soon. He tried to regain his composure.</p>

    <p>Ever since the war began between the East and West regions, the Eastern Emperor has been personally directing the war at the front. Logically speaking, there is no chance to enter the Palace of the Outer Gods to explore its secrets.</p>

    <p>Even if you really go in, the interior of the Palace of the Outer Gods is too dangerous. Even if an emperor-level figure goes in without adequate preparation, he will probably have a narrow escape. He will not be able to get out even for a moment.</p>

    <p>In such a short time... this is an impossible task. In addition, Emperor Dongda seems to be unscathed. This makes Yan Sanyang even more convinced. This is Emperor Dongda lying to him.</p>

    <p>"Emperor Dongda, if you have this ability, then use it as soon as possible." Above the main hall, Yan Sanyang couldn't help laughing loudly after thinking about everything.</p>

    <p>In front of the Supreme Suzaku Throne, Emperor Dongda saw this scene. His eyes became colder and colder. His aura suddenly increased, and he pressed directly on Yan Sanyang: "You are just an envoy. You are not qualified to shout like this with me."</p>

    <p>The sound wave transmission, like the cry of a red bird and a phoenix, shook the entire hall with an extremely harsh sound. All the people on Emperor Dongda's side had calm expressions. However, this phoenix cry instantly shocked Yan Sanyang until his seven orifices bled.</p>

    <p>The harsh memories kept reverberating in his mind, causing his brain to tumble. He knelt down in the hall on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda's body did not move. He just raised one hand and pressed forward. A phantom of a red bird roared out from his sleeves and robes, shocking everyone in the hall.</p>

    <p>Under the deafening call of the red bird and phoenix, those outside the Eastern Emperor's Palace were all alarmed. They instantly knew that the negotiations had collapsed.</p>

    <p>"Come in! Rescue Yan Envoy! The Western Emperor has an order. Whoever takes the head of the Eastern Emperor can establish himself as the new emperor!" The envoys entrenched outside had already encountered it. Each of them acted as if they had expected this. They were ready. Just waiting for the negotiation to break down, they all rushed into the hall.</p>

    <p>However, the strength of the emperor level was extremely astonishing. When they approached the main hall, Yan Sanyang, the envoy sent by the Western Emperor, had died tragically. His face was charred black. He was directly roasted into a charred corpse by the Suzaku fire. His appearance was strange. It was Wrapped in agony as he died.</p>

    <p>Everything happened too fast. They couldn't keep Yan Sanyang at all.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he saw dozens of elders from the Western Region envoys suddenly breaking into the palace of the Eastern Emperor. The Eastern Emperor remained motionless, overlooking the heroes, and fixedly looking at the Wu Yangyang people with the Hydra logo in front of them.</p>

    <p>When Ye Ren, the white-robed manager, saw these people, he immediately felt that the situation was not good. These people... are all carefully selected masters from the Western Regions. And each one of them has royal blood. They are powerful contenders for the emperor in the future.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Ye Ren would not have thought that the always calm Emperor Dongda would kill Yan Sanyang outright. Although Yan Sanyang provoked first, once the envoy died, it meant that the negotiation had collapsed.</p>

    <p>And at the same time, it also provided this group of elders sent from the Western Region with every excuse to launch a new round of war.</p>

    <p>At this time, the few veterans in the Eastern Emperor's Palace, headed by Ye Ren, were treating him seriously. Even though they were facing this irreversible situation, everyone had an attitude of looking forward to death.</p>

    <p>This scene made Wang Ling slightly moved. He had never witnessed the struggle of the Eternals with his own eyes. But he never thought that he would see it clearly today.</p>

    <p>It's like watching an epic royal war drama. All the contention in front of him is a game of power among these ancient cultivators from the eternal era.</p>
