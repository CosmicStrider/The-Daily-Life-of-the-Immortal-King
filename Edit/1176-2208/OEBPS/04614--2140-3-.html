  <h1>Chapter 2140 More than 3 people</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In order to ensure that Operation Wall Breaker can be carried out accurately, Wang Ling and Sun Rong are sent into the game world of Itinerant Immortal's magical ring to assist. This is the plan formulated by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He is the initiator and commander-in-chief of this plan. President Qi gave him complete power, giving him a place to use it.</p>

    <p>But in fact, although Wang Ming has found Wang Ling and Sun Rong to enter the game world, Shangfeng knows nothing about the details of Wang Ming's employment.</p>

    <p>They couldn't find out who Wang Ming sent in.</p>

    <p>Although it is said that people should be employed without suspicion and others should not be used, but always be prepared with both hands. This has been the inherent strategy of Huaxiu since the founding of the country. Huaxiu monks will never hang themselves on a tree.</p>

    <p>Prepare in many ways. Being prepared for a rainy day is the way to go.</p>

    <p>It's not that they don't trust Wang Ming. But if something unexpected happens to "Ling Rong's Team", the Shangfeng side still hopes that there will be other teams that can assist Mr. Zang Hu.</p>

    <p>This is the situation. So the auxiliary team of the Wallbreaker Project is actually more than the team sent out by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The highest-level decision-making unit in the Huaxiu Alliance is composed of ten members. Almost ten immortals crossed the sea to show their magical powers. They found someone they trusted and entered the world of Itinerant Immortal together.</p>

    <p>However, they knew nothing about each other. They all thought that they were the only team supporting Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't know anything about this move. He was the commander-in-chief, and he had the blessing of the brain.</p>

    <p>This behind-the-scenes operation cannot be hidden from him. But sometimes it is also important to pretend to be fake.</p>

    <p>Although in Wang Ming's opinion, there is already Wang Ling in the situation, it is actually meaningless for the rest of the people to enter the game world. In addition, ten generals will prepare additional auxiliary teams...the names and faces. Wang Ming is very familiar.</p>

    <p>Isn't this just looking for someone from the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I don't know who the boss behind the Office of Strategic Deception is...</p>

    <p>This boss is already in the game!</p>

    <p>But since it's already here, Wang Ming naturally can't stop it. He just pretends that he doesn't know.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that the guys at the Office of Strategic Deception are really busy.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, he has to follow the command of the boss behind the scenes to explore the clues of the Bai ZheFenmu Shen Alliance's secret invasion of the earth. On the other hand, he has to follow the order of Huaxiu Alliance to carry out the mission.</p>

    <p>One side is the boss, and the other side is the superior leader. When neither of them can be offended, it is very important to learn the {Great Separation Technique}.</p>

    <p>It can be said that {Great Clone Technique} is a required Heavenly Dao spell course for core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. Even if it cannot be directly differentiated into a person with absolute wisdom like Wang Ling, it will not be harmed by external forces. The real clone that was directly disintegrated.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, copy and paste yourself. That can still be done.</p>

    <p>Therefore, a large part of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception are involved in the Itinerant Immortal game. They use their avatars to perform tasks, rather than their true bodies.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if they are trapped in the gray fog, they don't have to worry about not being able to get out.</p>

    <p>The avatar's thinking consciousness is controlled by the main body. At that time, the avatar only needs to be released. As long as the layer of gray fog has not made their avatar real, the characters stuck in the game world will be forced offline directly.</p>

    <p>Of course, there are also people who are too lazy to use clones and just use the main body directly.</p>

    <p>That is Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>Not long after they completed their plan to secretly protect Wang Muyu, they received new instructions.</p>

    <p>Now the situation in the entire maritime restricted area is in a state of anxiety. Cracking the wall of spiritual consciousness has become a priority task. The two immediately decided to move to the game world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>The two of them also have a lot of experience. As children of planes who came here from other worlds, both of them have more or less experience in judging the situation.</p>

    <p>If you feel like you can't fight, then there is no need to continue to waste it.</p>

    <p>Besides, the fundamental purpose of staying in the Office of Strategic Deception is to move around and learn more with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming did not tell them about Wang Ling's participation in the Wall Breaker Project, Qin Zhong had his own way of making judgments.</p>

    <p>Before participating in the game, Qin Zhong prepared a six-sided dice.</p>

    <p>Three of the faces are marked with √. The other three faces are marked with ×.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xiang Yi was holding his sniper rifle, as if he already knew what Qin Zhong was going to do.</p>

    <p>The corner of his mouth twitched. It felt like it was something he often did when he was taking exams when he was very young and encountered multiple-choice or true-false questions that he didn't know.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter whether it is accurate or not when others throw this. But when Qin Zhong throws this, he is throwing stones to ask for directions!</p>

    <p>"Did Ling Zhenren participate in Operation Wallbreaker?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong asked the first question. Then he rolled the dice. The side that faced up was "√."</p>

    <p>Then comes the second question.</p>

    <p>"Did Ling Zhenren attend with the Sun Rong girl?"</p>

    <p>"√"</p>

    <p>"Is Ling Zhenren also invincible in the game?"</p>

    <p>"√"</p>

    <p>"Apart from Ling Zhenren, Miss Rong, me and Xiang Yi, are there anyone else involved in Operation Wall Breaker?"</p>

    <p>"√"</p>

    <p>"Are all the people involved from the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"×"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"so it is..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded slightly when he saw this. He felt that he understood everything instantly.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi's mouth twitched as he watched. He complained silently. He never thought that Qin Zhong could do such an operation.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong then made a new round of throwing before entering the game.</p>

    <p>The main purpose is to confirm the game professions selected by Wang Ling and Sun Rong. To ensure that Xiang Yi will not conflict with the profession.</p>

    <p>"That's it. Ling Zhenren chose the loser. Miss Rong chose the ancient heavy-armored monk." Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>He directly eliminated these two professions and planned to choose from the remaining people.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi's goal was very clear. He directly chose mechanics.</p>

    <p>As a sniper, the advantage of choosing a mechanic is that you can directly target the science and technology city. Although the coordinates of birth are different for each player, it is precisely because of this mechanism of binding the city that many players have increased the chance of encounters. Probability.</p>

    <p>After all, they are all on the same map. The probability of meeting is much higher than the probability of meeting at random coordinates within the world.</p>

    <p>But in fact it is not that easy to operate.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal is the future city of the Ring World. It is the largest known map in the entire game world. It has an area of about 50,000 Fuyun Town. Although it is advertised as a town, it feels like a small country.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this is also the only Grade A novice village in the world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>It is a modern mechanized world. It can be conquered, but it is extremely difficult. The patrol robots on the streets are all at the level of the Demon Lord of Hundred Cave. This makes many novice players directly intimidated. They gave up on joining together to cause trouble in the novice stage. idea.</p>

    <p>"I knew you would choose this. I can't help it. I'll go with you. I'll choose the mechanic too."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>He guessed Xiang Yi's choice.</p>

    <p>The two of them were not used to being a tie-up partner at the beginning, but now they have gradually developed a tacit understanding, which also made Xiang Yi accustomed to having such a magical koi around him all the time.</p>

    <p>"This map is very big. Even if we choose the same place, we may not meet each other," Xiang Yi said.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Once we get in, there will always be a way." Qin Zhong responded. He was always so confident.</p>

    <p>So, just after the two entered the game world together, a magical scene appeared.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi discovered that right next to him, there was a new player who looked very similar to Qin Zhong in facial data and joined the game at the same time.</p>

    <p>"Qin...Zong?" He shouted tentatively.</p>

    <p>Then he saw the player looking back at him with his iconic smile: "It's me."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xiang Yi was almost petrified. He couldn't help but uttered a curse word: "Hua Tsai! Your koi attributes can be brought directly into the virtual game world! Isn't this cheating on the spot? !"</p>
