  <h1>Chapter 1331 Jin Deng's great enlightenment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Something happened at the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei was in Luo Pangzi's shop.</p>

    <p>However, one can also feel a powerful energy fluctuation originating from the direction of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, can you go faster?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>The maintenance process cannot be interrupted. This is one of Boss Luo's nursing rules.</p>

    <p>Especially when it comes to Jingke's maintenance. Boss Luo will naturally never be vague.</p>

    <p>From what Lord Diulei said, it seems like something big happened at the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Luo Pangzi had no choice but to speed up the work at hand: "Don't worry, Zhenjun. It will be done soon."</p>

    <p>That's what he said, but he still felt a little reluctant to let go.</p>

    <p>Jingke and Bai Qiao...well, mainly Jingke. It's rare to have them in his hands for maintenance.</p>

    <p>He hasn't touched enough yet. He's about to be taken away again!</p>

    <p>How can it be repaired!</p>

    <p>After Luo Pangzi applied the last layer of maintenance lubricant, he quickly separated the sword body and scabbard and handed them to Lord Diulei's left and right hands.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Luo Pangzi also frowned deeply: "Zhenjun, do you feel... that energy wave seems to be getting closer?"</p>

    <p>Something is indeed wrong!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>He holds Jingke and Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>As soon as I opened the door, I saw a row of White HairSun Ying'ers standing neatly at the door of the store and smiling at me.</p>

    <p>--There are as many as ten!</p>

    <p>"Are you...Miss Sun's shadow?"</p>

    <p>Almost instantly. Combined with what happened before, Lord Diulei understood what was happening in front of him.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng had long predicted that Sun Ying'er might be detrimental to the Office of Strategic Deception. That's why he asked him to take out Jingke and Bai Qiao from Boss Luo's store in advance. Unexpectedly, he actually said that. middle.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei guessed it right away. The ten Sun Ying'ers in front of him were probably split bodies derived from Sun Ying'er's Shadow ability...</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, the energy of each split body is so huge!</p>

    <p>This is something Lord Diulei never expected.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the true king. It seems that you have guessed everything." The ten split-body Sun Ying'er said almost in unison.</p>

    <p>Their speaking speed and intonation were exactly the same. It was like ten repeaters playing at the same time.</p>

    <p>"What's your purpose?"</p>

    <p>"The backlash is the main thing. Then bring Rongrong back to the void together."</p>

    <p>"You think you can succeed easily?" Lord Diulei smiled.</p>

    <p>There are Jingke and Bai Qiao here!</p>

    <p>Even if there are 100 Sun Ying'ers, he will not be afraid.</p>

    <p>"True Lord, you can give it a try."</p>

    <p>At this time, ten Sun Ying'er stretched out their hands at the same time. The black shadows in their hands were activated. They rushed from all directions and finally completely engulfed Lord Diulei into a dark world.</p>

    <p>This is the core world of shadow. Every splinter can use the power of this core world.</p>

    <p>Now. When ten Sun Ying'ers sacrifice their core worlds at the same time,</p>

    <p>The area of the core world also increased instantly. It became ten times its original size.</p>

    <p>Her purpose is just to drag out the fight.</p>

    <p>Even if she is absorbed into the core world like Zhenyuan immortal and Miss Ajuan, Sun Ying'er is fearless.</p>

    <p>But the opponents she faces now are not just Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The mahogany sword and scabbard in this man's hand are the biggest threat.</p>

    <p>So after comprehensive consideration, the split-body Sun Ying'er immediately decided to take the first step and swallow Lord Diulei into his core world, thus realizing the clever plan of closing the door and beating the dog.</p>

    <p>After being absorbed into the dark core world, Lord Diulei could not help but feel turbulent.</p>

    <p>The energy of the ten split bodies of Sun Ying'er is astonishingly huge.</p>

    <p>Now they are merged and stacked together. Lord Diulei feels like he has difficulty breathing.</p>

    <p>As soon as he came to this core world, he felt a weight of relief on his body. It was like the pressure of several mountains sank heavily on his shoulders.</p>

    <p>"Master Jingke. Master Bai Qiao! Don't sleep anymore! It's time to get up. It's time to go to work!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>Then, he suddenly inserted Jingke into the scabbard!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This is a huge crisis that the Office of Strategic Deception has faced since its inception.</p>

    <p>Almost all core members have fought against the split body of Sun Ying'er. Wang Ling has also become aware of this.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren wants to go back and take a look?" the monk asked. He was also worried about the situation at the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>Now, it's not his turn to take action yet.</p>

    <p>As long as he is here.</p>

    <p>Naturally, we can ensure that Sun Rong is safe and sound.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is a good opponent.</p>

    <p>Strong enough. And it can also split.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's point of view, this can be regarded as an experience for all the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Ying'er is powerful, it is not easy to take Sun Rong away like this.</p>

    <p>I have my own considerations when I see Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng was naturally inconvenient to say anything.</p>

    <p>In front of us. Wang Ling finally arrived at the legendary unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>This magnificent floating island in the universe is filled with the aura created by the supreme law. The sight of it is mind-blowing.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed a place built by Dao Ancestor..." The monk could already feel the powerful Heavenly Dao aura permeating inside.</p>

    <p>Although these Heavenly Dao are all defective products, they are all original versions of the ancient Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>He finally came in!</p>

    <p>All this is thanks to Ling Zhenren!</p>

    <p>Years of wish finally came true at this moment.</p>

    <p>The monk felt that a knot in his heart that had been hindering him for a long time finally melted away like ice that had been frozen for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>A warm current surged into the monk's heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that the whole body of Monk Jin Deng was exuding golden Buddha light.</p>

    <p>This is a sign of enlightenment.</p>

    <p>The monk actually had an epiphany after entering the unspeakable place. Because the knot in his heart was resolved...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the scene in front of him, slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>"I'm back...everything is back..." At this time, the monk was sitting cross-legged on the shore of the unspeakable place. His whole body was covered with Buddha's light.</p>

    <p>It exudes the power of Buddha nature that can save all sentient beings and transcend the other side.</p>

    <p>Is this the sage of Buddhism...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels like I have learned a lot more.</p>

    <p>He is indeed a man who can survive ten palms of his own.</p>

    <p>And. Wang Ling found that the monk's combat power was gradually recovering. He was even stronger than before!</p>

    <p>The previous monk had lost 3000 lifetimes of cultivation and a swastika. Only the outline of Wang Ling could be seen clearly.</p>

    <p>Those lost cultivations. Wang Ling wanted to return it to the monk at that time. However, the monk declined.</p>

    <p>Now, after the enlightenment, the light of Buddhism in the monk made this lost power return again.</p>

    <p>Through King's Eyes. Wang Ling can clearly see the three Buddha fires entrenched in the monk's heart at this time.</p>

    <p>"Past Buddha Fire", "Present Buddha Fire" and "Future Buddha Fire"...</p>

    <p>So it is.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already understands what happened in the monk's body.</p>

    <p>The power of enlightenment stimulated the monk to give birth to the "Buddha Fire of the Past", allowing the lost power to be recovered.</p>

    <p>Even the 10 lifetimes of cultivation previously lost in the land abandoned by the gods have been recovered!</p>

    <p>"Now the Buddha's Fire" makes the monk achieve great enlightenment, consolidates his own realm, and prevents the lost cultivation from passing away.</p>

    <p>To put it simply. If the monk activates the swastika now, he will peek at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Blindness is certain. But it can no longer affect your cultivation.</p>

    <p>And the last "Buddha Fire of the Future" made the monk's cultivation even more refined, and he suddenly realized a new Buddhist palm technique!</p>

    <p>"Thanks to Ling Zhenren! This poor monk has a chance to gain enlightenment!"</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the enlightened monk finally stood up. He sincerely thanked Wang Ling: "If you have time, please Ling Zhenren, please hit me a few more times. I want to test whether there is really no loss of cultivation." ."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the monk should open his mind.</p>
