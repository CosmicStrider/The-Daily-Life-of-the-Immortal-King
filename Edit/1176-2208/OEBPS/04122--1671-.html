  <h1>Chapter 1671 Zhou Ziyi. Merit!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The development of the matter was beyond everyone's expectation. In other words, the effect of Jiugong Liangzi's slap was beyond everyone's expectation.</p>

    <p>Due to the effect of monk Jin Deng's "consecration technique", Jiugong Liangzi's attributes in all aspects have been beyond his own realm. It can be said to be the height of dimension advancement.</p>

    <p>This slap is a slap blessed by the sage of Buddhism. Its power is huge! It is enough to physically transcend all the people in the ancestral realm!</p>

    <p>However, when this slap fell on Zhou Ziyi, who was wearing a five-layer thermal underwear suit.</p>

    <p>This directly produces a very magical scientific and physical reaction.</p>

    <p>That is - the effects of forces are mutual!</p>

    <p>When this powerful slap landed on Zhou Ziyi's back, the backlash power released by thermal underwear also quickly fell on Jiugong Liangzi's slap due to the "reciprocal relationship between force."</p>

    <p>But because "the effects of force are reciprocal", when the force of the counterattack backfired on Shang, a new force of counterattack was produced again.</p>

    <p>And because "the effects of force are mutually related", the new counterattack force conveyed by Jiugong Liangzi once again fell on the thermal underwear suit...</p>

    <p>So over and over again. Over and over again.</p>

    <p>It was only a matter of seconds before Jiugong Liangzi came into contact with Zhou Ziyi. Due to the interaction of the forces, the force of the backlash was overlapped by the repeated horizontal jumps. It directly formed an explosive thrust!</p>

    <p>Let Zhou Ziyi emerge from the sky at that moment...</p>

    <p>Let him. Become light!</p>

    <p>In an instant, Zhou Ziyi shot out and hit 1212 in the abdomen on the spot, advancing forward with a devastating destructive power!</p>

    <p>At the moment of impact, 1212 Soul was shocked. Although its reaction was very fast, almost at the same moment when Zhou Ziyi's head hammer came up, it stretched out its hand to try to resist Zhou Ziyi's impact.</p>

    <p>However, it never expected that a Foundation Building period would have such powerful destructive power!</p>

    <p>His two arms melted on the spot at the moment of contact. Zhou Ziyi's whole body was surging with the red backlash of thermal underwear and the Buddhist holy light generated by the influence of the consecration. These two forces did not They cancel each other out due to mutual influence. Instead, they become stronger and stronger under the influence of each other.</p>

    <p>The unexpected moment caused 1212 to lose his left and right arms in an instant. The holy Buddhist holy light was like two bundles of whips. The moment 1212's arm collapsed, it penetrated into the body along the wound.</p>

    <p>This destructive power and lethality can no longer be stopped.</p>

    <p>1212 gritted his teeth. He never expected that he would be targeted as soon as he was resurrected.</p>

    <p>This life is definitely no longer safe.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he could only find a way to make Zhou Ziyi stop in the last few seconds of his life.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>These damn cultivators must die!</p>

    <p>As the representative of the "Old Faction" among the nameless beings, 1212's hatred for everyone has almost reached its limit at this moment.</p>

    <p>It secretly swore in its heart that it would kill all these human beings in the most cruel way.</p>

    <p>It wants these people to endure the greatest pain alive. You can see clearly that your stomach has been cut open. Bits of liver and intestines have been cut off, and then it eats them until nothing is left!</p>

    <p>At the end of his life, 1212 used the power of his hatred to detonate himself. The huge explosion impact forced Zhou Ziyi to stop his "human missile" behavior.</p>

    <p>And myself. It has become a torn apart piece.</p>

    <p>But 1212 did not die just yet.</p>

    <p>It has at least 1.26 million lives!</p>

    <p>Not to mention being blown to pieces. Even if it is turned into ashes, it can be resurrected quickly.</p>

    <p>The surging body finally stopped. Zhou Ziyi touched his head. He didn't know what happened at all. He only felt that he had moved a long distance after receiving Jiugong Liangzi's slap...</p>

    <p>When his body finally stopped, except for a little smoke caused by the huge air friction, his whole body was completely unscathed.</p>

    <p>A team headed by Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong arrived quickly later.</p>

    <p>Seeing that 1212 had just appeared, he was turned into cannon fodder by Zhou Ziyi. Zhuo Yi's face was beaming with joy: "Okay! Xiaoyi! You have done a great job! Well done!"</p>

    <p>Originally Zhuo Yi brought Zhou Ziyi to the Virtual Realm. The purpose was to help Zhou Ziyi make a contribution. Unexpectedly, this wish would be granted so quickly.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi himself was obviously still in a state of confusion. He had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi had an apologetic expression on her face. According to her past temper, she was definitely not someone who would apologize immediately. She must have expressed her apology in a roundabout way.</p>

    <p>But just now she realized that she was really wrong.</p>

    <p>"Ziyi. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you." Jiugong Liangzi leaned forward and said.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, sister-in-law." Zhou Ziyi touched his head and smiled bitterly: "Ah, by the way, sister-in-law. What I want to say is that there is really nothing to do between Brother Qin Zhong and Brother Zhuo Yi. And Brother Qin Zhong has a wife."</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhou Ziyi accidentally learned about this while chatting with Qin Zhong not long ago.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>These words made Jiugong Liangzi blush instantly. He wished he could dig a hole and bury himself directly in it.</p>

    <p>OMG...</p>

    <p>What has she done.</p>

    <p>I actually suspect Qin Zhong is a pervert who likes men...</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. It was my fault." Then Jiugong Liangzi turned around and apologized to Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>It's so shameful.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. It's all just a misunderstanding." Qin Zhong showed his signature smile.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was not angry at all because of Jiugong Liangzi's misunderstanding. On the contrary, he found this jealous feeling a bit cute.</p>

    <p>Little girls in love are probably all the same. They always like to think about random things. However, if you think about it, problems will arise.</p>

    <p>But now is obviously not the time to think wildly.</p>

    <p>Because 1212 is still alive.</p>

    <p>And right in front of them. Reorganization has been completed.</p>

    <p>It was at this time that everyone saw clearly what 1212 looked like.</p>

    <p>A strange humanoid creature with mantis hands. On its head there is only a bloody mouth filled with fangs. Just looking at it makes it feel like it's infiltrating people.</p>

    <p>"If we follow the information provided by Mr. Ming, to kill this 1212, we must kill him 1.26 million times. I'm afraid it's not that easy to do." At this time, Zhou Ziyi said.</p>

    <p>"That's not necessarily true. Although most indescribable creatures have the ability to resurrect, as long as they don't want to be resurrected and block the idea of continuing to resurrect, they don't necessarily have to kill 1.26 million times." At this time. Monk Jin Deng smiled slightly. He took a step forward and said, "The young monk has a plan."</p>

    <p>"What can Senior Jin Deng do?" Sun Rong became curious.</p>

    <p>"It's just a method I just thought of. As long as the little donor can give up the idea of resurrection." Monk Jin Deng showed a kind smile. He felt that his method had a high success rate. Maybe he could make 1212 give up on his own initiative. The idea of resurrection.</p>

    <p>"Damn humans... I will kill you all!"</p>

    <p>At this time, 1212 has completely reorganized. Disgusting mucus is released from his bloody mouth.</p>

    <p>But Jin Deng is faster.</p>

    <p>He quickly came behind 1212. He patted the ground behind him. A compacted earth wall was instantly constructed from behind 1212. Along with the consecration technique, Jin Deng also consecrated the wall.</p>

    <p>"Have you ever played table tennis?" asked Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "?"</p>

    <p>At this time, without saying anything, Monk Jin Deng stepped forward and gently slapped Zhou Ziyi on the back. Then Zhou Ziyi turned into a beam of light again and shot out.</p>

    <p>So now, in front of everyone's eyes, a very magical scene happened.</p>

    <p>1212 stood in front of the illuminated wall, suddenly becoming a pillar of human flesh.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was sent away with a palm by monk Jin Deng, smashing 1212 into pieces.</p>

    <p>1212 Before he finished cursing, he was already being planned.</p>

    <p>Then Zhou Ziyi bounced back from the wall behind 1212. Then he was sent out again. He smashed the resurrected 1212 into pieces...</p>

    <p>One palm after another. Over and over again. Over and over again.</p>

    <p>It's like doing table tennis fixed-point hitting training...</p>

    <p>When it reaches the 1,600th round.</p>

    <p>1212 completely fell into despair and gave up thinking about resurrection.</p>

    <p>It was instantly killed as soon as it was resurrected. This kind of life with no gaming experience. It no longer wants to continue...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>1212 it. Went peacefully...</p>
