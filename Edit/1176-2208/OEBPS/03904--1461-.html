  <h1>Chapter 1461 In broad daylight</h1>

  <div>



<p>Under the cloak, Jiugong Liangzi's resentful eyes seemed to be able to swallow Zhuo Yi whole.</p>

<p>Ha. He is indeed an old liar who is putting on airs. He uses his stolen honors to flaunt himself. Just become a benchmark for his fellow juniors and juniors...</p>

<p>He even tried to plot something against his fellow junior sister!</p>

<p>As a leader of a government-certified educational institution, there is a big problem with this style!</p>

<p>Jiugong Liangzi pretended to read a book. There was a thick dictionary-like book placed on her delicate thighs.</p>

<p>Pretending to read a book, he was actually talking to the ghosts collected in the books.</p>

<p>"Write everything down?" Jiugong Liangzi said coldly.</p>
    
<p>The ghost on the page she is facing now is the ghost made in Huaxiu that escaped to Sun Island earlier. It was given the nickname: Bi Xianzi<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>("Pen Fairy" Pen Fairy)</dfn>

<p>"Yes. I have recorded it all." Bi Xianzi nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>Wearing a red dress, she recorded what she heard into words on the painting desk. Then she directly drew what she saw. The level of detail is no different from that of a digital camera.</p>

<p>At the same time, these recorded words can be extracted. As long as you recite the spell afterwards, these recorded words will sound like Zhuo Yi's own voice.</p>

<p>As expected of Bi Xianzi.</p>

<p>Jiugong Liangzi was very satisfied.</p>

<p>This ghost named "Bi Xianzi" is actually very powerful.</p>

<p>Create your own legend about "Bi Immortal." Let those who believe in this legend summon her.</p>

<p>In the name of "immortal", he deduces the future for others at the cost of devouring Yang Qi and longevity.</p>

<p>But in fact, such calculations have no effect at all. They are all deceptive tricks.</p>

<p>The most troublesome thing is that the legend about the immortal pen has spread all over the world, causing this ghost to commit crimes all over the world.</p>

<p>In the end, various fake bodies can even be differentiated to "collect rent" in place of the real body.</p>

<p>The Jiugong family spent a huge price to recover this Bi Xianzi. But fortunately, they finally successfully set up a trap and successfully captured the Bi Xianzi's body on Sun Island.</p>

<p>And then there will be no more.</p>

<p>Bi Xianzi is now sealed forever in Jiugong's Ghost Book and has become Jiugong Liangzi's event recorder.</p>

<p>The Jiugong family's Ghost Book. It contains all kinds of troublesome ghosts captured by the Jiugong family since they started their family.</p>

<p>Now, after years of accumulation, the ghosts in the main book are so strong that they cannot be suppressed by human power.</p>

<p>Therefore, it has been sealed in the underground seal cellar of Jiugong's house.</p>

<p>The book in Jiugong Liangzi's hands is actually a reprint of {Ghost Book}. The reprint is completely synchronized with the ghosts included in the main book.</p>

<p>But the power of these ghosts has been greatly weakened.</p>

<p>It is precisely because of this that Jiugong Liangzi can easily mobilize these ghosts to be driven by him.</p>

<p>"I'm going to trouble you all today." He closed the Ghost Book. Jiugong Liangzi stood up.</p>

<p>She has no interest in those Number 60 High School students. She just came here to collect "criminal evidence" for Zhuo Yi to commit adultery.</p>

<p>Last night, Zhuo Yi saw a woman on TV. In fact, it was not that Zhuo Yi was blinded.</p>

<p>Instead, Jiugong Liangzi is using the ghost named "Ah Zhen" in {Ghost Book} to monitor the situation of Zhuo Yi.</p>

<p>"Ah Zhen" originally had a beautiful love before her death. Unfortunately, the man she loved, "Ah Qiang", changed his heart and colluded with other women to kill her.</p>

<p>Before he died, all of Ah Zhen's resentment was input into the TV in front of him.</p>

<p>After that, she launched her own revenge.</p>

<p>But anyone who did not turn off the TV, on the screen in front of the blatant show of love ...... or want to borrow the sound of the TV, to cover their sounds, one has not escaped the clutches of Ah Zhen.</p>

<p>And if Ah Zhen knew that a man would be dating several women at the same time.</p>

<p>That man will die even worse.</p>

<p>However, that was all in the past.</p>

<p>The time when "Ah Zhen" fell in love with "Ah Qiang" has passed.</p>

<p>Now Ah Zhen. is an important intelligence detector under Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

<p>When I saw Zhuo Yi, I got up and walked towards the entrance of the ancient street.</p>

<p>Jiugong Liangzi quickly got up from the bench and followed Zhuo Yi secretly.</p>

<p>"Zhuo Yi. You would never have thought that... all your actions are within my control." She couldn't help but sneer in her heart.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the ancient street, Zhuo Yi took out his "Changyou Card" to verify his identity. A staff member recognized Zhuo Yi.</p>

<p>However, Zhuo Yi just winked. The staff quickly understood. These are mature employees who have been replaced by Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

<p>Based on Boss Sun's current friendship with Zhuo Yi. Zhuo Yi's face still carries a lot of weight in the hearts of these mature employees.</p>

<p>The mature employee showed a professional smile.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the ancient street."</p>

<p>After walking a few steps, Zhuo Yi raised the corners of his lips and showed a meaningful smile: "Are you following?"</p>

<p>In fact, he had already noticed the clues last night.</p>

<p>It should be noted that one of Zhuo Yi's pupils has partial authorization from King's Eyes.</p>

<p>Although this part of the authorization is very small, dealing with a ghost is still a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>"Classmate Jiugong Liangzi. Let's see."</p>

<p>He didn't know why. Zhuo Yi felt that his face was a little stiff when he smiled.</p>

<p>He pretended not to know. He just continued to move forward according to his own rhythm.</p>

<p>I especially want to see what Jiugong Liangzi will do next.</p><p>...</p>



<p>On the other side, Wang Ling took Sun Rong. and teleported to a remote bush in front of the ancient street square.</p>

<p>This location is relatively hidden.</p>

<p>No one outside saw them teleporting here.</p>

<p>"Let's go."</p>

<p>Wang Ling put his pants in his pockets. He looked at the girl. Then he stepped out of the bush.</p>

<p>And outside the bushes, there happened to be a mother and daughter. They looked at the scene in front of them in shock.</p>

<p>If a boy comes out from behind such a bush, he may not be able to find a toilet. He may find a corner for convenience or something like that...</p>

<p>But a boy and a girl came out of the bushes one after the other.</p>

<p>The scene in front of me can't help but make people think a little bit.</p>

<p>Wang Ling has a hunch. He and Sun Rong may be misunderstood.</p>

<p>And what's worse is that Mother Wang deliberately did not button all the buttons of his shirt in order to expose his collarbone...</p>

<p>Ever since, when the middle-aged woman with her daughter saw this scene, she almost immediately imagined an indescribable drama in her mind.</p>

<p>"Mom! Why did my brothers and sisters come out of that place?" the little girl was curious.</p>

<p>"Kids! Don't meddle in other people's business! Not suitable for young children!"</p>

<p>The middle-aged woman's face turned red. She grabbed her daughter and ran away.</p>

<p>She marveled inwardly.</p>

<p>Today's young people are so bold!</p>

<p>In broad daylight, the universe is clear, indescribable, shameless...</p></div>
