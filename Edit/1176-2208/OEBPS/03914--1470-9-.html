  <h1>Chapter 1470 The Gift of the 9th House</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I understand..." Inoue Masahide nodded seriously.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that Miss Liangzi is a well-known tsundere.</p>

    <p>If you deny it, it means...</p>

    <p>"No! You don't understand!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi stared at Masahiro Inoue: "Although I promised to let you go, you have to remember. Don't make me angry. Otherwise, the consequences will be serious. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"I understand..." Viagra nodded, like a chicken pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>For him, there is no need to explain now.</p>

    <p>Because the situation is already clear.</p>

    <p>Miss Jiugong Liangzi. She is obviously anxious!</p>

    <p>If there wasn't another connection behind it, would it be necessary to explain in such a hurry...</p>

    <p>If it was a few days ago, there would be no second possibility for Jiugong Liangzi to blush.</p>

    <p>That was 100% due to my hatred for the old liar Zhuo after hearing the name "Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>But now the girl's face is red and her ears are red. It does have another meaning.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi is different from what she imagined. Not only is he not a liar, he is also a truly capable man.</p>

    <p>In just six years, it is impossible to reach this level of cultivation no matter what...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Jiugong Liangzi infers that Zhuo Yi's Golden Core is definitely an act. His true strength is definitely more than that.</p>

    <p>But currently, Jiugong Liangzi has not found the reason why Zhuo Yi hides his realm.</p>

    <p>Maybe in the beginning, he came here with the intention of keeping a low profile. He was just accidentally discovered?</p>

    <p>And the "boy" the Day-traveling ghost was talking about was most likely a witness at the scene...</p>

    <p>So from the very beginning, did the entire Jiugong family actually misunderstand Zhuo Yi?</p>

    <p>If his speculation is true, then who is the boy that the Day-traveling ghost saw?</p>

    <p>"It seems."</p>

    <p>"We still have to find that dead fish eye."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi was thinking.</p>

    <p>Her train of thought was still very clear. She had no intention of giving up looking for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Boys and girls at this age are always very curious.</p>

    <p>After this unexpected incident, Jiugong Liangzi began to be wary of the Jiugong children he claimed to have carefully selected from Sun Island to help him in his work.</p>

    <p>There is definitely a mole in the villa. It's just that it's not yet certain who the mole is.</p>

    <p>Although the private doctor named "Mucun Dahe" is suspected, there is currently no conclusive evidence for the girl.</p>

    <p>"So. What are you going to do next?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the girl. There was an unspeakable doting in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Let's find a way first. Settle the three of them nearby. I will send people to guard and protect them." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"The mole just happened to be sent here, right?" Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. This time he is my confidant. You should have seen him in school before."</p>

    <p>"Oh. I remembered. You mean. Your female bodyguard?"</p>

    <p>"Her name is Junko. She's been with me since I was little. There won't be any problem."</p>

    <p>"Understood."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi crossed his arms. He thought for a moment. Suddenly he realized that he had found an opportunity to get close to the girl: "But have you ever thought about it. If you send her out, what will you do?"</p>

    <p>This question made the girl fall into silence.</p>

    <p>What Zhuo Yi said actually makes sense...</p>

    <p>So far, Jiugong Liangzi still doesn't know the reason for the riot in the replica {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>Just in case there is another problem later, do it when no one is around.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid she will die ugly...</p>

    <p>The girl did not expect that the ancestral magic weapon that she regarded as the most powerful magic weapon and relied deeply on it would suddenly turn into a time bomb.</p>

    <p>"To be honest, with a ghost of that level just now, your female bodyguard is useless by your side. So I suggest you. It's better to hire new people."</p>

    <p>"Rehire?" Jiugong Liangzi frowned: "Money is not a problem. But where should I find someone..."</p>

    <p>"Me." Zhuo Yi pointed to himself: "Good quality and low price. I'm always available. Jiugong doesn't have to worry about my work. Even if I'm at work, my spirit sword can lock the enemy from thousands of miles away." , precise strike. It is more than enough to protect your safety within the territory of Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhuo Yi is a humble statement.</p>

    <p>"Yu" is the second spiritual sword on the sword list. In fact, every corner of the earth can be taken care of. The scope is not just the country of Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>"you?"</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>She lamented in her heart the shamelessness of the man in front of her...</p>

    <p>I came to Huaxiu country by myself. Obviously I came to investigate him! I came to seek revenge!</p>

    <p>This girl is great. Not only is she not hiding from her, but she is also planning to stick to her as her bodyguard... This is outrageous!</p>

    <p>"The food in the cafeteria of your Hundred Schools General Administration is so good. How can I make you so shameless?" Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Zhuo Yi with disdain.</p>

    <p>That's what she said. But in her heart, she felt that this plan seemed pretty good...</p>

    <p>Since Zhuo Yi's combat power is not as bad as the legend says, protecting her safety is indeed not a problem.</p>

    <p>In addition, if Zhuo Yi had been by her side, it might be easier for her to investigate the whereabouts of the "dead fish-eyed boy."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi always has an intuition.</p>

    <p>She felt that there must be a connection between Zhuo Yi and that boy.</p>

    <p>Maybe they even know each other!</p>

    <p>"How's it going?" At this time, Zhuo Yi looked at the girl with a smile. He was looking forward to the answer.</p>

    <p>"According to the market price, with your fighting power, your monthly salary must be at least 100 million. Our Jiugong family has limited funds. I'm afraid..."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't cost that much. Just give it to me at the normal Golden Core price." Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>The bargain was successful. The girl showed a proud smile. Then the smile instantly disappeared from her face.</p>

    <p>She crossed her arms and assumed the familiar posture of a young lady. She looked at Zhuo Yi and said, "Then, I will reluctantly give you the gift of being my bodyguard. But you are only responsible for my safety. Other things. You are not allowed to ask any questions."</p>

    <p>"No problem."Zhuo Yi nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Let's go to the hotel. I checked. The nearby Holiday Inn Gujie Hotel is more affordable."</p>

    <p>"hotel?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Jiugong Liangzi with a sense of surprise.</p>

    <p>"What? Is there a problem? Is the hotel closed?"</p>

    <p>"No..." Zhuo Yi smiled evilly: "That's it, classmate Jiugong. I'm only responsible for safety issues. But if you rent a room, it's another price."</p>

    <p>"Who wants to book a room with you! I will never book a room with you in my life! Stop dreaming!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's face suddenly lit up again. She shouted loudly: "I said. Of course you and I escorted these three people to the hotel together!!!"</p>

    <p>This attempt to hide one's shyness by shouting made Zhuo Yi's heart beat wildly again.</p>

    <p>Since he became famous, there are actually many girls around him.</p>

    <p>Secretary Boss Sun sometimes recommends some beauties among civil servants to him and introduces him to his girlfriend.</p>

    <p>I have seen a lot of beautiful girls Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But being as cute as Liangzi is really rare.</p>

    <p>"It's just a joke. Jiugong, please don't be angry."</p>

    <p>Same as before. Zhuo Yi apologized quickly: "Then. Let's go."</p>

    <p>It's so quick to offend someone...and it's so quick to apologize...</p>

    <p>So, Jiugong Liangzi wanted to curse, but couldn't.</p>

    <p>However, the group of people was about to leave in front of the Taoist temple. The girl stopped again: "Well...I suddenly thought of something."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi asked softly: "What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "I want to block the news about these three people. So I can't pay the hotel room fee for the time being... Can you pay it in advance? I will add it to yours when I do the accounting later. In the salary."</p>

    <p>"Okay."</p>

    <p>The Zhuo Yi agreed readily, "Flesh compensation is fine."</p>

    <p>"Pervert!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath. He pinched his slightly trembling fists and kicked Zhuo Yi's calves hard. Then he quickly rushed out the door.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi chased behind: "It feels so comfortable! Classmate Jiugong! Come on a few more times!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Shameless..."</p>
