  <h1>Chapter 1863 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The gatekeeper beast suddenly fell to the ground. Not one of the four lion dragon beasts was left. They were all foaming at the mouth and twitching on the ground. No one knew what happened.</p>

    <p>However, even so, the management of the Central Auction House is still only in an orderly manner. The auction house is usually prepared for emergency plans like this. However, it is a bit rare to face the situation where all the gatekeeper beasts are knocked down at once.</p>

    <p>One of the administrators was wearing a cheongsam. A tall woman with an almost perfect figure, holding a communication jade, began to conduct on-site command.</p>

    <p>She is the administrator of the Central Auction House. Her name is Chen Yanan. She is responsible for all matters maintaining the order of the auction house.</p>

    <p>"One group listens to my order. Immediately use the backup gatekeeper beasts. The second group moves all four lion dragon beasts away. Don't cause congestion in front of the auction house."</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan responded quickly. She spoke very quickly: "In addition, this matter needs to be reported to the president. I will personally find the president to report the situation. During this period, the order maintenance and replacement work in front of the door will be under the command of the deputy administrator."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling entered the auction house, he immediately heard all the arrangements in front of the door. It can only be said that the Central Auction House is more powerful than he imagined.</p>

    <p>After all, this was during the gathering of the Four Emperors. Such a mistake in guarding the gate beast was a serious accident.</p>

    <p>However, the Central Auction House did not panic due to unexpected situations. This shows that its contingency plans are well prepared.</p>

    <p>But after something like this happened, there were suddenly more topics to discuss in the auction house hall. It instantly became more lively.</p>

    <p>"It's strange. These four lion dragon beasts are full of energy. They have grown fat and strong. They don't look like they are sick. Why did they faint suddenly?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't Zhang Zhui say he was going to steal the items from Emperor Xi's auction today? Maybe he did it."</p>

    <p>"That's right! It must be Zhang Zhui! Maybe he has already sneaked in!"</p>

    <p>"But that's not right. Is Zhang Zhui's realm that strong? Even if he moves his hand, is it possible to knock down four mythical beasts at once?"</p>

    <p>"God knows. He has been sneaking around all day long. He might have stolen some secret medicine. It's not necessarily that his strength increased instantly."</p>

    <p>Several cultivators who came to participate in the auction were communicating loudly in the hall. Zhang Zhui, who played Li Ren, was heard sweating profusely.</p>

    <p>Now, he finally understood why there weren't so many gatekeeper beasts in front of the door when he came here...</p>

    <p>And he also knew why, after the auction, he was not only being pursued by the Western Emperor, but also the president of the Central Auction House.</p>

    <p>This bank manager is a fan of lions and dragons. He loves the four lion dragons he raises. Now the crowd's discussion directly puts the blame on his head. It's no wonder that the bank president hates himself.</p>

    <p>At this time, a spiritual light appeared in the sky. Above a huge cloud, a young man wearing golden armor came across the sky holding the Iron Throne. He was extremely domineering.</p>

    <p>On each side of him stood a woman with a snake body. They were originally from the human race, but they willingly accepted the implantation spell of the Western Emperor. They were implanted with the blood of a sacred beast called the snake god, and then turned into the half-orcs.</p>

    <p>They have graceful figures. They stand side by side. They don't care about other people's eyes at all. They only concentrate on serving the young man in golden armor.</p>

    <p>"This is... King Tiankun under Emperor Xi!"</p>

    <p>Someone exclaimed, recognizing the origin of this person.</p>

    <p>This Iron Throne was given by the Western Emperor. It means that in the palace of the Western Region Imperial Palace, King Tiankun does not need to worship. He can sit on an equal footing with the Western Emperor in the palace.</p>

    <p>No one can have the same treatment as King Tiankun.</p>

    <p>This is the general who guards the order of the Western Region for the Western Emperor and pacifies the wars of all parties. He is regarded as the symbol and representative of the Western Emperor. No one expected that King Tiankun would also come to the Central Auction House this time.</p>

    <p>"I heard that someone wants to cause trouble at this auction. I want to see if Zhang Zhui can steal the immortal stone that I, Emperor Xi, want to sell from under my nose." He sneered. Stepping through the door, you walk like a dragon and a tiger. You are so domineering.</p>

    <p>In the hall, all forces gathered together. People came in batches. They had distinguished status. They were all well-known figures.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a premonition. He felt that among the other friends who entered this world and were scattered in various places, some of them must be in the auction house at this time.</p>

    <p>The key lies in how to distinguish them accurately.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at everyone here with a trace of laziness.</p>

    <p>Then Emperor Dongda led everyone into a private room on the upper floor.</p>

    <p>This is a VIP room. It is a must-have in the auction house. It is impossible to sit here without certain financial resources. As soon as he opened the door and walked in. Sun Rong was already deeply attracted by the dazzling array of exquisite jade porcelain in front of her.</p>

    <p>Eternal things are extraordinary, making her always have a deep curiosity.</p>

    <p>"Sir, if you want to sit here, you must ensure that you buy at least one treasure in this auction." At this time, Wang Ling heard the voice of the administrator who was commanding order at the door.</p>

    <p>Chen Yanan had never met Emperor Dongda. Facing Emperor Dongda who was on patrol incognito this time, she didn't even know what the background of this plainly dressed young man in front of her was.</p>

    <p>So she reminded him loudly. She kindly told Wang Ling that there is a minimum consumption in this private room. You must ensure that you buy a treasure in this auction house before you can take a seat.</p>

    <p>"I understand the rules." Dongda smiled and waved his hand, indicating to Zhang Zhui to pay.</p>

    <p>Li Ren had already prepared all the expenses for this meeting of the Four Emperors in his storage bag.</p>

    <p>The currency of eternal cultivators is the Hunling Stone. A kind of spiritual stone that combines the power of chaos. It is an extinct product in modern cultivation society.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui did not hesitate. He directly paid Chen Yanan a full 100 million mixed spirit stones as a deposit for the private room.</p>

    <p>If they fail to take at least one item in the end, the deposit is non-refundable.</p>

    <p>"Sir, you are generous." Chen Yanan nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>She just acted according to the rules. She didn't mean to look down on anyone. After all, the status of people who can enter this auction house is not simple.</p>

    <p>After receiving the deposit, Chen Yanan personally escorted Wang Ling and others in. Then she bowed at the door before slowly walking away.</p>

    <p>"She is an administrator of the Central Auction House. She doesn't know her seniors?" Sun Rong is incredulous.</p>

    <p>"People in the imperial palace seldom go out. It's normal if they don't know each other. Li Ren is the personal guard of Emperor Dongda. Outsiders know even less."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui replied in the team phonetics: "In addition, even if you are lucky enough to see the emperor, most people are not strong enough to see the emperor's true face clearly."</p>

    <p>This answer made Sun Rong understand instantly.</p>

    <p>This effect is similar to Wang Ling's "Great Shielding Technique."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "We just spent 100 million. How much is left now?"</p>

    <p>In the private room, Zhang Zhui immediately imitated Li Ren and replied: "There are still two billion mixed spirit stones left."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was shocked: "But I remember that I asked Li Ren to prepare only 500 million..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui chuckled: "That's right. I couldn't hold it back just now, I took a little... Everything should go a little more smoothly. No one should notice it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying, Wang Zhen, Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As expected of you!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong dumbfounded: "Senior Zhang. I thought you had changed... This is bad behavior!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't help but sigh: "Hey. Under the influence of the rule of law in modern cultivation society, except when necessary to perform tasks, I haven't done such sneaky things for a long time. But once I return to this eternal life, I still have a little tolerance. No, it's a conditioned reflex. You can't blame me entirely. It's okay. If the money is not used later, I will donate it all. It will be robbed from the rich and given to the poor!"</p>
