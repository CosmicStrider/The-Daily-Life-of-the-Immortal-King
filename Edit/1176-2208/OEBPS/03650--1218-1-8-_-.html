  <h1>Chapter 1218 Lao Gudong's first hexagram 8 mistake</h1>

  <div>



<p>What is it like to listen to the teacher tell your mother's story in class?</p>

<p>Wang Ling had a premonition that this history lesson would become very magical...</p>

<p>At the scene, there are actually many people who know the true identity of Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Several people from the God Realm know it. They are just pretending to be confused.</p>

<p>Being confused is not a bad thing sometimes. As a person is alive, sometimes when you should be confused, you will be a little more confused. Then you will not have so many worries.</p>

<p>Seeing that Wang Ling could not answer. Lao Gudong nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>He had long expected that such a situation would happen. The expression on his face was very happy. In fact, since the first semester of Number 60 High School, Lao Gudong has been looking for opportunities to talk about his master's "ghost." "Axe Spirit Mother." It is a pity that there has never been a suitable entry point.</p>

<p>But now after the national competition, he finally found one.</p>

<p>"It seems that none of the students know who this Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is. So today, let's talk about this Ghost Ax Spirit Mother." Lao Gudong showed a proud expression on his face. The reason is that he I have deep respect for this name.</p>

<p>So although Lao Gudong likes to popularize "gossip" in history classes, Wang Ling is not worried that the content of this class will go astray.</p>

<p>The person I am talking about is my master. The content must be extremely positive and positive!</p>

<p>"Dear students, in the previous class we talked about the story of Gorgeous itinerant and Taotie Taoist, two epic killers who created the killer list. In fact, the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is related to these two people."</p>

<p>Lao Gudong faced everyone and said: "The Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is the ancestor of the killer world rumored in the killer world! No matter whether you are stunningly beautiful or gluttonous, you are all her disciples!"</p>

<p>As soon as this statement came out, the whole class was in an uproar!</p>

<p>Wang Ling and several people from the God Realm also opened their mouths, pretending to be surprised.</p>

<p>As expected, the atmosphere in the class became lively as Lao Gudong spoke.</p>

<p>"Why is this name given? Has anyone seen the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother? The Spirit Mother should be female, right?"</p>

<p>"No one has seen Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Not even her two disciples know. As for why she gave this name, I think it may be her label for herself. She was named Ghost because of her incredible assassination skills. The name Ax. As for whether the spiritual mother refers to my own gender, I'm not sure." Lao Gudong said.</p><p>"..."</p>



<p>Hearing this. Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>
    
<p>In fact, there is a hint in this ghost spirit mother. As far as he knows, Mother Wang had already decided on his name before giving birth to him. If the child was a boy, it would be called Wang Ling. The child was a girl. The ball is called Wang Ling<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>("王令" Wáng lìng vs "王灵" wáng líng)</dfn>

<p>So the second half of the name "Guixu Lingmu", "Lingmu", means "Ling (Ling) Mother"...</p>

<p>"Why did the teacher suddenly mention this person today?"</p>

<p>At this time, someone in class asked a key question.</p>

<p>"Ghost Ax Spirit Mother's code of conduct has always been low-key. She has always kept herself secret. The major killers in the killer world have joined forces to establish the Spirit Mother Foundation. It specializes in crowdfunding to find the whereabouts of the Spirit Mother. Although she is currently among the cultivators No one still knows where the Spirit Mother is. But there is still a lot of factual evidence that shows that the Spirit Mother has returned to the world... For example, in this national competition, there are traces of the Spirit Mother appearing."</p>

<p>"The Ghost Ax Spirit Mother appeared in the national competition?" The whole class was shocked again.</p>

<p>Even Wang Ling looked confused now.</p>

<p>His mother is obviously raising her baby at home... When did she go to the national competition?</p>

<p>Could it be the fake Ghost Ax Spirit Mother that Jiang Yingyue mentioned before?</p>

<p>"In this national competition, due to a mysterious behind-the-scenes pusher, a large number of dead wanted criminals on the dark web were temporarily resurrected. Huaxiu Alliance sent a large number of cultivators to prevent this... and among all the people who were resurrected. There is the Dark Ancestor Evil Three Smiles who shocked the whole world back then!"</p>

<p>"Is it the originator of the dark web, Xie Sanxiao?" Guo Hao couldn't help but sweat just by hearing this name. He had accidentally seen this name before when he was checking information in the library. He was full of great curiosity. Guo Hao He decided to go over the wall to see if there was more information on the Internet... but it turned out that the things Anzu Xie Sanxiao did back then made him unable to eat for several days.</p>

<p>This is an absolutely cruel, cruel person. The level of evil is beyond the scope of a normal person's understanding.</p>

<p>"It seems that some classmates seem to know what kind of role this person is..." Lao Gudong said this. His brows also frowned: "If Xie Sanxiao was really resurrected at that time, he would immediately announce a plan for everyone. The world's revenge. There is no doubt about it."</p>

<p>"Teacher. What happened next?"</p>

<p>"eh...a large amount of factual evidence shows that Xie Sanxiao has been killed. I have also seen pictures of his body through some channels before. However, due to confidentiality regulations, it cannot be disclosed to the students." Lao Gudong said: " According to my judgment, Xie Sanxiao died due to a very skillful assassination technique."</p>

<p>Lao Gudong said this. Several people in God's Domain also began to discuss in an independent spiritual space.</p>

<p>Zhenyuan: "Wang Zhen. Didn't you go to the Stalactite Cave? Didn't you see Xie Sanxiao?"</p>

<p>Wang Zhen: "No! It really wasn't me! Xiao Yin, Er Ha and I were almost evenly matched after defeating Li Huanran!"</p>

<p>Zhenyuan: "Then how did Xie Sanxiao die? Could it be that senior Ling took action?"</p>

<p>"No."Wang Ling flatly rejected it.</p>

<p>He was busy playing with meteorites with Wang Ying at the time. He had no idea how Xie Sanxiao died. By the time he came back from the universe, Wang Zhen had almost taken care of everything. It was really a normal game without any difficulty. Push the game.</p>

<p>I'm afraid only Wang Ying knows the answer to this matter now.</p>

<p>Wang Ling looked downward. Staring at his own shadow.</p>

<p>Wang Ying was shocked when she saw it: "I was only focused on fighting you at that time. I couldn't care less about the evil three smiles..."</p>

<p>Wang Ling Speechless: "..."</p>

<p>Wasn't this Evil Three Smiles brought back to life by you?</p>

<p>"I have researched a lot of information. I think Xie Sanxiao is indeed the strongest among the darknet members. But this person is too suspicious. I wanted to feed him frozen dumplings to activate his Shadow. This person pretended to swallow the dumplings. Then he spit it out secretly, which caused a sharp decrease in combat effectiveness..." Wang Ying couldn't help complaining: "If I had activated Shadow, how could I have been killed so easily?"</p>

<p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

<p>At this moment, in class, Lao Gudong spoke again: "According to the evidence I saw, Xie Sanxiao's body had a total of 862 fatal stab wounds when he was found. It was within one second. With extreme The assassination was completed at a fast frequency...the depth of each wound was the same. The accuracy was outrageous."</p>

<p>Lao Gudong sighed: "No one can do this kind of assassination except the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother, the ancestor of the killer world!"</p>

<p>Wang Ling: "..."</p></div>
