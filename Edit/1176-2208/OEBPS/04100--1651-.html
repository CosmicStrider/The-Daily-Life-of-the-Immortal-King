  <h1>Chapter 1651 Here it comes again! Universal brain waves!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took a closer look at this wealthy businessman who looked very much like the "Lord of the Rings." His ten fingers were full of jewels. He couldn't help but feel a little suspicious.</p>

    <p>There seems to be something wrong with this person...</p>

    <p>If you are a native of this science and technology city, you shouldn't know about the outside world.</p>

    <p>He looked at the wealthy businessman's eyes. The more he looked at him, the more he felt that there was something familiar in his eyes. It was as if he had seen him somewhere.</p>

    <p>And soon. Zhuo Yi suddenly thought of something: "Are you...Mr. Ming?"</p>

    <p>After hearing what Zhuo Yi said, the expression on the rich businessman's face twitched obviously. Then he couldn't hold it back and laughed out loud: "Oh. It's boring. I thought I could deceive you for a little longer."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that this wealthy businessman was actually Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>But how did Wang Ming do it?</p>

    <p>Taking possession of his body?</p>

    <p>This is obviously impossible...</p>

    <p>He is not a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Could it be some form of mental control?</p>

    <p>But in this illusory world, which is completely isolated from the outside world, Wang Ming shouldn't be able to do such a thing no matter how strong his mind is, right?</p>

    <p>"This is Shou Chong. I had originally wanted to talk to him. But unfortunately, someone got there first." Wang Ming said through the body of this wealthy businessman.</p>

    <p>The biggest advantage of mental control is that such a disguise makes it almost impossible to see any flaws.</p>

    <p>If Zhuo Yi hadn't done some research on the two Wang brothers, had strong observation skills, and could distinguish from details, I'm afraid there would be no way he could be associated with Wang Ming so easily.</p>

    <p>And the guess he just blurted out naturally had an element of luck in it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi never thought that he would be right.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ming said, Shou Chong was captured? And he was brought here?" Zhuo Yi suddenly felt that the clues to the whole matter had become complicated. Originally, his purpose was to follow Zhang Zhui and Li Xian The main purpose of the two men's actions behind the scenes was to help Zhou Ziyi achieve success.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Shou Chong has a micro-sending device that I developed and designed. When my brain waves tracked the device, it felt like I accidentally fell into a gap in time and space. I had no choice but to send part of my brain. The radio waves are separated and out of danger."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "The separated brain waves were transmitted to this space after floating for a short period of time."</p>

    <p>"Gecko tail-breaking maneuver." Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh. That's how it works."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded through the wealthy businessman's body and said: "But this is a different space after all. My separated brain waves are very weak. I can't stay separated from my body for a long time. There is no other way. I can only find it casually. A man who looks very rich is taking control."</p>

    <p>"I see..." Zhuo Yi asked with concern: "Isn't Mr. Ming very dangerous?"</p>

    <p>"It's not dangerous. Anyway, this separated brain wave is similar to your clone technique. It won't have any impact on my body. It just lasts for a very limited time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed: "Fortunately, the fat man I possessed is not only rich, but also has a moderate IQ. In this case, I can generate new brain waves through his brain. The brain waves separated from my body Make supplements. But with this method, production is less than consumption. After all, I can't last too long."</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming explained, Zhou Ziyi listened with her mouth wide open.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't understand what Wang Ming was saying at all.</p>

    <p>But he can still understand the basic situation.</p>

    <p>The wealthy businessman sitting in front of them now is not communicating with his true will. Instead, he is possessed by a senior whom Zhuo Yi knows.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Qin Zhong was also curious about Wang Ming's appearance.</p>

    <p>Can an ordinary human being who is not a cultivator actually develop the human brain to such an extreme level?</p>

    <p>He was amazed inwardly.</p>

    <p>I once again felt that the world was huge and full of wonders.</p>

    <p>Although I accidentally fell into an inexplicable place from the original world, it seems now.</p>

    <p>It seems that there is no gain at all. Zhuo Yi was filled with admiration: "As expected of Mr. Ming. Only Mr. Ming can do such a thing."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming waved his hand. I don't know when I learned to be modest. "Don't be so formal. This Ziyi brother. I already know him. Why don't you introduce me. Who is this white-faced brother ?"</p>

    <p>"His name is Qin Zhong. He seems to be a strange man who fell from other dimensions."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi finished speaking. He gently whispered in Wang Ming's ear: "Mr. Ming, there is something weird about this person. I feel that he is surprisingly lucky..."</p>

    <p>"Qin Zhong?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chewed the name carefully.</p>

    <p>Then, suddenly, like an enlightenment, something hit me in my mind, and I was shaken violently.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>This name. Isn't it the character in the game {Cultivation Simulator} originally designed by Bai Qiao?</p>

    <p>As for this game, he also participated in the development of it, so it is still fresh in his memory.</p>

    <p>Of course. The crux of the problem is not here.</p>

    <p>The point is, he remembers when he was testing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling once created a character named "Qin Zhong" through this game. And the lucky value was set to x!</p>

    <p>"Interesting."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>He glanced at Qin Zhong calmly.</p>

    <p>Although it is not certain that Qin Zhong is really related to the characters created by playing games with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But if this thing is true, it is a strange news.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ming took the initiative to extend his hand: "Hello. Mr. Cartoon Man."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "???"</p>

    <p>Realizing that he had let slip something, Wang Ming stuck out his tongue and tried to be cute: "Ah, sorry. I was just thinking about something else. Hello, Mr. Qin Zhong. Nice to meet you."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong also responded with the same gentle smile as always: "Since you are Brother Zhuo's friend, you are my friend. Brother Zhuo calls you Mr. Ming. Then I will follow Brother Zhuo."</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>"But then again. Does Mr. Ming know exactly who he is?"</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Because of the intervention of brain waves, he has completely figured out the details of this wealthy businessman.</p>

    <p>"This man's name is Jia Bugui. He runs an auction house in the core area. It sounds like he's a respectable person."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sits on a chair in the stands. Laughing: "And thanks to him. I also know a lot of other news about the core area. For example. The one that these powerful people always talk about. After the fight. I can explain it all to you. For now. Let's just watch the fight first. Liangzi is working very hard. What she's going to face next is this Black Dragon."</p>

    <p>Liangzi student?</p>

    <p>When Zhou Ziyi heard this, he was stunned for a moment. Then he looked at Wang Ming with surprise: "Mr. Ming said...the one on the stage is my sister-in-law?"</p>

    <p>"I remember, didn't you live with Zhuo Yi for a while? Your sister-in-law's breasts are so flat. You didn't even notice?"</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming finished speaking, Zhou Ziyi's face turned red instantly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi dumbfounded: "As expected of Mr. Ming..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I definitely didn't rely on the boobs to judge." Wang Ming laughed.</p>

    <p>In fact. Everyone's brain wave signal has its own unique frequency.</p>

    <p>In order to facilitate the identification of acquaintances, whenever Wang Ming met, he had the habit of memorizing the brain wave frequency band in advance.</p>

    <p>This special identification method is what Wang Ming can do.</p>

    <p>So there was no need for any fancy tricks. When he first saw Jiugong Liangzi appearing as a cloaked man, he had already recognized him.</p>

    <p>"So, the other two people, Mr. Ming, also know about it?" Zhuo Yi asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Ming said bluntly: "The ones standing at the back. One is Rongrong. The other. I couldn't detect his brainwave frequency. But I think I know it's Jin Deng senior. Monks, they're supposed to be pure in their minds."</p>

    <p>"It's really them..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is too miserable to say: "But why are Liangzi and the others here? I clearly asked her to..."</p>

    <p>"Girls in love are very suspicious. I guess she is worried about you flirting with other people when you are not in her sight." Wang Ming laughed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Seriously..."</p>

    <p>"Somewhere in the neighborhood." Wang Ming showed his hand. At this moment, this is a deep exchange between two men who are in love with others and who belong to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "You don't even know. Yinzi was so jealous that she deleted all the porn on my disk. Those are my favorites for years."</p>

    <p>"That is indeed a bit of a shame..." Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"It's not a shame. Because that was supposed to confuse her."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"People today. You don't really store your favorite movies on a cloud drive, do you? Wouldn't it be a blood loss if they were compromised?" Wang Ming shrugged and said, "I uploaded them directly to my brain. It's always available on demand."</p>
