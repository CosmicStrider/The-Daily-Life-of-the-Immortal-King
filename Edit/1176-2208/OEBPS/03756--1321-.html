  <h1>Chapter 1321 The road to Zhuo Yi is long and wide</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had a strong feeling. He felt that that stupid groundhog might still be alive.</p>

    <p>But so far, the other party's aura is indeed gone.</p>

    <p>After all, it is the number one divine beast under Dao Ancestor Wang. Er Ha was able to escape death by leaving his body. This marmot may not be able to do it.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling is not worried that this groundhog will continue to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>He was killed by himself three times in a row.</p>

    <p>Such a psychological shadow. It took Er Ha a long time to come back to his senses.</p>

    <p>At night. Wang Ling's figure appeared in the Desert of Bones.</p>

    <p>The intricate guidance device ahead came into view of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These devices are all made of cosmic alloy.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng traveled to countless planets to collect the materials to build these devices.</p>

    <p>The metal conduits were arranged by the monks and connected end to end according to the design drawings. They were densely covered in the ground and surface of the desert, spread out like a spider web.</p>

    <p>The Desert of Bones is called the Desert of Bones because there are many quicksand areas here.</p>

    <p>If an ordinary device is placed on top, it will be swallowed by the quicksand due to its weight, and then sink directly to the bottom of the desert.</p>

    <p>But these cosmic alloys are different. Not only are they extremely strong, but the key is that they are as light as a feather. They are just right for laying in such an environment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw.</p>

    <p>These spider web-like devices finally converged on a central point in the desert.</p>

    <p>That should be where the Chaos Egg is placed.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling!"</p>

    <p>"Na na! Ling Zhenren is here!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Miss Ajuan saw Wang Ling from afar.</p>

    <p>Today is Monday. Originally, Wang Ling should be doing homework at this time.</p>

    <p>The reason why I have time to come out and "join in the fun" now. Lord Diulei knows that a large part of the reason is because Number 60 High School is still under construction.</p>

    <p>Because it was bombed by the foundation before, the opening of Number 60 High School was delayed for a while.</p>

    <p>Originally Zhuo Yi estimated that the repair would be completed on Monday.</p>

    <p>However, Principal Chen's construction requirements are relatively high. He also has to spend some time beautifying the campus environment.</p>

    <p>So the holiday at Number 60 High School will last until the weekend.</p>

    <p>The real start of school is actually next Monday, which is December 7th.</p>

    <p>Of course, before the official start of school, students in their 60s do not have nothing to do... they still have to check in for online classes on DingTalk!</p>

    <p>At this time, Lord Diulei's expression suddenly changed. He stretched out his arm and pulled Wang Ling aside. He showed a very gossipy expression: "Brother, is Miss Sun Rong okay now? I heard that she was captured by a groundhog, and you saved her!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest. Wang Ling is very surprised. Because Lord Diulei has been concentrating on arranging the device. I didn't expect that the information could be so well-informed.</p>

    <p>"Brother, you want to know how I got the news?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said with a smile: "Didn't you see DingTalk? We DingTalk have an Office of Strategic Deception working group. I remember pulling you in."</p>

    <p>In order to facilitate work exchanges and mutual support, Lord Diulei also jumped on the bandwagon and set up a working group, bringing in all the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled.</p>

    <p>He really didn't notice this.</p>

    <p>Because DingTalk has so many study groups...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Chen Chao and Guo Hao also brought Wang Ling into many "homework exchange groups." The euphemistic name is to exchange homework. In fact, they copy each other...</p>

    <p>As for the Office of Strategic Deception working group established by Lord Diulei, it was buried in the sea of group chats.</p>

    <p>But now it's too late when Wang Ling discovers it.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi is already in the working group. He has shared a lot of things about "tasks."</p>

    <p>"Look here. Here. And here... it's all what brother Zhuo Yi said in it."</p>

    <p>In chronological order. Zhuo Yi posted his work experience directly in the group chat.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Today's work is to go to the hospital to visit the Sun Rong schoolgirl. This Sun Rong schoolgirl is lying in the medical cabin doing sit-ups. It's really heartbreaking. But with Master's help, I guess it won't happen. Something big happened."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Today's job is to protect the Sun Rong schoolgirl. Senior Heavenly Dao is here. I feel a lot more at ease."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong has been resurrected too many times. It seems that some resurrection ban has been triggered. The body has become transparent, which will reduce the sense of existence. Fortunately, senior Jin Deng took action and placed Sun Rong in the Buddha Inside the Golden Lotus."</p>

    <p>"PS: Senior Jin Deng was invited by Master. Master has never been so interested in a girl. Hehehehe! I feel like I have discovered some incredible secret!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"I went home with Sun Rong to sort out my things. Senior Heavenly Dao used the Great Sacrifice Technique to help Sun Rong burn a lot of things. Only the desk and wardrobe were not allowed to be burned. I watched secretly. Eyes on the desk. I found Sun Rong's junior classmate actually imitating Master's handwriting... hehehehe!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Today's work is to accompany Sun Rong school girl to the God's Domain to watch the immortal gods fight. As soon as the master appeared on the stage, he pierced the Dao God brain of the head of the Zhou family. Then he used virtual images to fight the six Dao Gods. I found Sun Rong The school girl recognized Master's virtual image at a glance! Then! Her eyes were fixed on Master the whole time. She never left! Hehehehe!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"I can't. I've been observing the various reactions of Sun Rong schoolmates when they see their master. It's so interesting! My aunt laughed the whole time. I couldn't stop! Hey. It's great to be young! Is this youth? !"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Today's task is to protect the Sun Rong junior student in the underground seclusion cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception with Senior Heavenly Dao. In order to be able to return to the physical body in the future, the Sun Rong senior student recalls the experience of the soul state. I worked very hard to sort out everything that happened these days in my little notebook. PS: I am selling a copy of the sketch portrait of Master drawn by my classmate Sun Rong. Need to chat privately..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Woooo! Master, she is in danger. She is back! Master is awesome! (broken sound)"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Looking at Zhuo Yi posting these messages in the work group, Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Brother Ling has also discovered it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said with a smile: "Actually, these messages were originally posted by brother Zhuo Yi in Space Talk. And it should be only visible to brother Zhuo Yi... But a while ago, this DingTalk seemed to be related to Talk about a cooperative relationship. Messages started to be synchronized and exchanged. Zhuo Yi classmate didn't seem to realize this yet. Then the messages in his space were synchronized to the DingTalk group."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Brother, don't worry... I have confirmed this. Brother Zhuo's DingTalk account is a small account. And there is only one working group of Office of Strategic Deception in the whole account. So the message he posted on Space Talk. The synchronization has only reached this point. But judging from Brother Zhuo's reaction, it seems that he hasn't discovered it yet."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the underground cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi updated his information again.</p>

    <p>He didn't talk about it in space.</p>

    <p>Instead, choose to publish directly in the working group of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And he deliberately used a tone that sounded like he was talking and publishing in space. He wrote in his work diary: "Since I called me Master, Sun Rong, the school girl seems to be angry. She is blushing and still doesn't speak. Hehehe. Master. I can only help you so much."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
