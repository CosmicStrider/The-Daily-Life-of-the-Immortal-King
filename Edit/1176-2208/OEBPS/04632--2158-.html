  <h1>Chapter 2158 Open cabin kill!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The In the game cabin. Wang Ling is in a calm mood.</p>

    <p>He deduced it with his fingers and roughly understood what happened.</p>

    <p>You can't beat yourself in the game world. So you want to kill yourself in the real world, right?</p>

    <p>I have to say, the ideas of these thugs are really bold.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that this was an unexpected episode. Even Wang Ling did not expect that he would be forced offline halfway through the game. Then the whole person was ejected by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>His heart was calm. He even wanted to laugh a little.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Wang Xiaoer is worthy of being Wang Xiaoer. It seems that he has never been ambiguous about cheating him.</p>

    <p>On the other side, after learning that Qingjiao successfully hacked into the game cabin and successfully conducted a remote launch.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the Four Elephants was very excited. They succeeded!</p>

    <p>And not long after, the damn real player who plays the role of the general of Fuyun Town will appear in front of them.</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu has even thought of a package of revenge methods. For example, what kind of posture should he use to open the game cabin door handsomely and drag up the hateful guy inside who disrupted his overall plan.</p>

    <p>"Brother, we are going to succeed!"</p>

    <p>The remaining people looked at the location of the game cabin on the radar map. They saw that the entire game cabin was rapidly approaching an island near the restricted sea area at the speed of a rocket.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that Si Xiang had been in exile overseas for so many years and that all the main members of his gang were hiding on this seemingly desolate island.</p>

    <p>They dare not set foot in the country of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But this island is actually an uninhabited island that the evil Jian Shen had previously purchased through other people's identities for the development of the Four Elephants. He knew that this day would come, so he had prepared all the plans in advance and kept them as a backup plan.</p>

    <p>But hundreds of years have passed since the island was purchased. Even Evil Jian Shen himself forgot that he still had such an overseas asset.</p>

    <p>As the financial officer of the Four Elephants, Xiong Wu remembered to honestly write down all the financial income and expenditure details of the group. He also knew the situation of this small island very well.</p>

    <p>He and the other three fellow disciples of the Four Elephants hid here. They practiced diligently every day in order to find a chance to turn over.</p>

    <p>"I won't bother my brothers to take action on the matter of opening the cabin to kill people. I, my little brother, will go and come back." Qingjiao snorted and smiled.</p>

    <p>He is holding a blue Void Sword. There are ripples on it. If you stare at it for a long time, you will feel like there are many illusions.</p>

    <p>"Then it's up to you, Fourth Brother."</p>

    <p>"The game cabin will arrive at the coordinates of 787.120 on the island soon. Fourth brother, be careful."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, brothers. No matter how strong that person is, he's just a fat nerd who plays games. It's nothing to worry about at all. What I hate most is the guy who grabs the ranking. No matter who is the sixth one, he dares to grab my position. Then It's a dead end."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Qingjiao said excitedly.</p>

    <p>The base of the Four Elephants is set up fifty meters underground on the island.</p>

    <p>After Qingjiao finished explaining his affairs, he stood on top of the teleportation circle and was teleported directly to the surface of the island through the teleportation circle.</p>

    <p>He showed his white teeth. It looked like he was really confident.</p>

    <p>Under a coconut tree, Qing Jiao's eyes were fixed on the light spots speeding in the distance. He was almost impatient and wanted to take action. It would be better to just cut the opponent's game cabin in the air with one move of sword energy. Let this guy be buried directly in the sea!</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>Doing this seems a bit too cheap.</p>

    <p>Moreover, falling into the sea cannot directly confirm that the other party is actually dead.</p>

    <p>Qingjiao frowned slightly. In the end, he endured it and decided to follow the original plan to open the cabin and kill.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Soon, the game cabin stopped above the island. A huge parachute flew out of the cabin, causing the game cabin's landing speed to slow down rapidly.</p>

    <p>Qingjiao watched this scene with his eyes. He had been holding back on the island for too long. He had been holding back the desire to kill in his heart. Maybe it was because he had not been stained with blood for too long.</p>

    <p>This gave Qingjiao an unprecedented sense of excitement.</p>

    <p>"Young man... I'm only to blame for your bad luck. Playing games is too high-profile. Remember next time. Don't fall into the hands of someone who doesn't follow the rules..."</p>

    <p>Qingjiao hummed and smiled. He slowly stepped forward. Under the scorching sun, his shadow changed directly on the game cabin of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>His hand was just on the door of the game cabin. He planned to tear the door open directly.</p>

    <p>As a result, something unexpected happened that Qingjiao didn't expect.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In the game cabin. Wang Ling kicked down the cabin door. The entire cabin door flew out together with the green dragon that was pulling on the cabin door.</p>

    <p>It was just an ordinary kick...</p>

    <p>Qingjiao was kicked in the front by Wang Ling. The huge impact gave him the feeling of being hit hard by a 10,000-ton giant ship.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>In an instant, Qingjiao's skull was completely shattered. He vomited blood. The meridians all over his body were severed by Wang Ling's ordinary kick. His body flew straight away.</p>

    <p>Several big trees were broken down along the island one after another. Even the thick rock walls were directly pierced by flying green dragons, leaving a human-shaped crater.</p>

    <p>"There seems to be someone."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling climbed out of the game cabin.</p>

    <p>He just felt like there was someone at the cabin door. He was worried that he would be in danger, so he lightly kicked open the cabin door as a legitimate means of defense.</p>

    <p>This is to prevent yourself from being violated.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, he kicked him and the man flew directly in front of him...</p>

    <p>Why.</p>

    <p>This is too overwhelming.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if he can bear this gentle kick.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was quite worried for a while. After all, kicking someone to death is a bit exaggerated.</p>

    <p>Although Itinerant Immortal is weak, it's not that weak...</p>

    <p>At least he gave it a gentle kick two months ago. The probability of survival is pretty high.</p>

    <p>Oh no...</p>

    <p>It's been two months.</p>

    <p>He has also grown.</p>

    <p>Talisman's suppression effect is getting worse and worse. This shows that his current combat power is really difficult to compare with two months ago.</p>

    <p>Sigh. How to clean up the mess in front of us has become Wang Ling's biggest problem now.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the monitoring room of the Sixiang Base, everyone else looked at the secret monitor on the island and saw all this.</p>

    <p>Everyone opened their mouths. They couldn't believe their eyes.</p>

    <p>Because right in front of their eyes, they clearly saw the moment when the Itinerant Immortal-level green dragon opened the game cabin. The person in the cabin kicked open the door and the green dragon together.</p>

    <p>And now. Qingjiao is seriously injured...</p>

    <p>The whole person, like a scarecrow, flew from one part of the island to the beach at the other end. His whole body was covered in blood from being kicked. His head was dented directly after being hit head-on.</p>

    <p>It was just a kick...</p>

    <p>Can you kick Itinerant Immortal like this?</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu was shocked.</p>
