  <h1>Chapter 1614 Looking for BUG</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facts have proved that women's thinking is absolutely rational. Although Shou Chong is obsessed with his laboratory and various weird inventions.</p>

    <p>However, in order to earn research funds and successfully sell his invention, Shou Chong also has a certain status in the circle of rich women.</p>

    <p>A long, long time ago, he was once called the "Women Killer."</p>

    <p>If it weren't for his age, he wouldn't be able to withstand the lethality of the steel wire ball.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong feels that he can fight for another five hundred years.</p>

    <p>Therefore, becoming an internet celebrity creates virtual economic value by spreading your inventions by producing online videos.</p>

    <p>This is Shou Chong's last resort.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged women he earned from his research fees have transformed from the beginning to rich ladies like Jiugong Liangzi, like Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>It is true that young ladies are rich.</p>

    <p>But it's the time of puberty in the hearts of girls.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong found that he still couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>Of course, it may also be because he was once addicted to relationships with women.</p>

    <p>This has led to the current solidification of thinking.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, I can't understand the thoughts of these ladies...</p>

    <p>After interrupting the call with Sun Rong, Shou Chong also complained about the weirdness of this incident,</p>

    <p>What a ghost. Apparently they were secretly scheming a while ago. Is this reconciliation too fast?</p>

    <p>Now, the plan to get in touch with Sun Rong and contact Zhuo Yi has failed.</p>

    <p>There are variables in this matter through Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi. Shou Chong feels that his actions are indeed a bit aggressive.</p>

    <p>After just contacting both parties, Shou Chong began to have a vague intuition.</p>

    <p>He felt that the two eldest ladies might be in the same boat now.</p>

    <p>If this is the case, it would be very dangerous to exchange dirty information about Jiugong Liangzi in exchange for the opportunity to meet Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for him to compete with the eldest ladies of the two major chaebols with his own strength.</p>

    <p>"It seems that there is only other way."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong sighed silently.</p>

    <p>The assistants in the laboratory all looked shocked.</p>

    <p>"Does the teacher want to..."</p>

    <p>"I can only take out the bottom-of-the-box treasure. As long as I can establish a connection with Number 60 High School, it will only take a matter of minutes to find Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong lit a cigarette and held it in his mouth. Then he said: "And in this way, we can kill two birds with one stone. See if there are any hidden people among the students of Number 60 High School..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wednesday, December 23rd. The day after the incident involving cultivators turning into animals ended.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, Wang Ling's study life has returned to normal order.</p>

    <p>Although there are still some people who did not come to school, it is no big deal.</p>

    <p>It is said that Number 60 High School specially sent several teams of psychological teachers to provide psychological counseling to students who have completely turned into animals.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was extremely envious: "Ah! Teacher Yang Hanyin, the chief teacher of the psychotherapy room, is so beautiful! It's so cheap!"</p>

    <p>He heard that Teacher Yang was going to visit Guo Hao's home. He had been hyping this up in the class since the morning self-study.</p>

    <p>Obviously in the animalization incident, the most comfortable person was Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>Playing with whips and candles at home with humanized sister-in-law Er Dan. I don't want to go to school. It's because of the psychological shadow!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao crossed his arms in anger and said carelessly in the class.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling kept wiping sweat on the side.</p>

    <p>If someone else said it, Wang Ling might not believe it.</p>

    <p>But coming from Chen Chao's mouth, the result is different.</p>

    <p>In today's morning class, Teacher Pan did not ask me to write the Talisman formula silently as soon as I entered the door.</p>

    <p>Instead, he held a notice and asked Su Xiao to help him send it out.</p>

    <p>"National Cultivation Academy Ranking System Update Notice." The gray notice was stamped with a black stamp that was copied in batches by the school. The huge title suddenly caught everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>"As you can see, all the cultivation academies ranking systems across the country are about to receive a new update.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan stood on the podium and said to everyone: "There will be five-dimensional tests mainly through consciousness, strength, speed, knowledge, and blood. Then a comprehensive evaluation will be carried out. The test results will be published on the list. Everyone can see it. Get your real-time ranking."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling stared at this notice.</p>

    <p>I feel that the contents of these dimensional tests seem a bit familiar...</p>

    <p>After all, he had just recently tested it from the palace of the outer gods.</p>

    <p>And the values have all reached positive infinity.</p>

    <p>If Number 60 High School were to conduct this test now. This made Wang Ling instantly feel that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>At this time, someone raised his hand: "Teacher, are our rankings on the same list as those of Golden Core college students?"</p>

    <p>"The ranking of high schools and the ranking of universities are independent. But they are also a reference for subsequent further studies. It will definitely be easier for students with higher rankings to advance to higher schools. I hope everyone can pay attention to it."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said: "However, the system has not been updated so quickly. It is still in the internal testing stage. The Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools is inviting bids. A suitable testing system for scientific enterprises across the country needs the cooperation of many universities. Only after testing can it be launched nationwide."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Everyone nodded.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling looked at the notice in his hand. He understood what it meant.</p>

    <p>It seems that the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance has received submissions from several technology companies.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School seems to be conducting experience activities on one of the test systems. Let's see if the entire testing system can operate normally.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>What worries Wang Ling the most is not the test system itself.</p>

    <p>But the person who developed this testing system...</p>

    <p>"Everyone has seen the notice. The system currently assigned to our school is a masterpiece developed by Master Shou Chong, a very popular scientist on the Internet." Teacher Pan said so. But In fact, my heart is full of emotions. Even if you listen carefully, you will feel that there is a bit of yin and yang in these words.</p>

    <p>She never pays attention to those Internet celebrities. She has no interest in Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>As for the title of master, it is just a polite title...</p>

    <p>What no one knows is that Teacher Pan actually has a very disgusting feeling towards Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>It's not because of Shou Chong's weird inventions.</p>

    <p>It was Shou Chong who used those inventions to deceive several of her best friends in the women's circle...</p>

    <p>Therefore, this time Shou Chong's test system was put to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>So Teacher Pan felt that he had caught the revengeful master.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she stood on the podium and said with indignation: "Students! I hope everyone will cooperate in taking the test this time! Who can find the bug in this system! You can have the right not to participate in dictation later! Plus a mysterious gift package from the class teacher One portion! Guaranteed value for money! It will definitely be wanted by every student here!"</p>

    <p>"Big gift package? It can't be homework..." someone couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>"I guarantee it with my personality and all my classmates. I guarantee it is not homework." Teacher Pan said with a smile: "And the gift package also contains a lot of gift certificates."</p>

    <p>"Gift certificate?"</p>

    <p>"For example, don't call parents a coupon. As long as it's not a heinous principle error, you can use this coupon to avoid calling parents to come to school."</p>

    <p>"For example. Number 60 High School canteen coupon! With this coupon, you can go to the school canteen to enjoy a great discount of 198 off when you spend 200 or more! Classmate Wang Ling. Your favorite dry noodles! You can get this coupon Come and fight for it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest. Wang Ling originally did not intend to cooperate in finding bugs.</p>

    <p>But the discounts given are really too many...</p>
