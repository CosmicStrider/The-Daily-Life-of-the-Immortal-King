  <h1>Chapter 1543 Only 18</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Girls who fall in love are scary. In the gym, Wang Ling directly experienced the power of "generating electricity with love."</p>

    <p>In the rioting Nine-Tails mode, Matsushita Singha is like the god of death on the battlefield!</p>

    <p>"This..." Central control room. Jisaki was stunned.</p>

    <p>The situation in front of him was unexpected. He didn't expect such a thing to happen.</p>

    <p>At this time, it's not the case for those on the blue side to fight back. It's also not the case for those on the blue side to not fight back.</p>

    <p>If they fight back, they are also attacking their teammates. It will only worsen the situation at hand.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha chased seven people by herself. The points were already deducted.</p>

    <p>Only a few minutes after the start. This is already a loss of dozens of points...</p>

    <p>If they fight back again, the negative value will be further increased.</p>

    <p>"No! We have to fight back!" The seven people were chased for a while. Finally, they decided to grit their teeth and join forces to send Matsushita Singha away first...</p>

    <p>As long as this madwoman is on the team, they can't win.</p>

    <p>Although Matsushita Singha is the main force, she is too much of a hindrance now. It is better to send her away in one wave and then find a way to earn back the points.</p>

    <p>"What a crazy woman!"</p>

    <p>In the blue team's team, someone angrily criticized Matsushita Singha for his behavior of beating friendly troops.</p>

    <p>This is a boy. The clothes on his chest were torn to pieces by Matsushita Singha. He was also slapped on the chest.</p>

    <p>It made his blood boil.</p>

    <p>It feels like watching a TV series about a green tea bitch hooking up with a scumbag.</p>

    <p>The boy remembered that his mother was always watching this show these past few nights. And he watched it with his mother. He could often feel this feeling of being so angry that his heart was filled with congestion.</p>

    <p>Now he was slapped in the chest by Matsushita Singha in "Nine-Tails Mode."</p>

    <p>Under this internal and external attack, the boy finally couldn't bear it anymore and spat out a large mouthful of blood, then fainted.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the situation has reached a climax.</p>

    <p>"Jieya Miedie! Wake up!" Lan Fang and the remaining people shouted.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the boy who fainted after spurting blood has already passed out...</p>

    <p>The referee's ball immediately flew to the boy's side, released the healing spray, and then lifted the boy off.</p>

    <p>This indicates that this classmate named Jieya Miedie has completely failed.</p>

    <p>The blue team originally wanted to team up with seven people to deal with Matsushita Singha. But now one person has been directly eliminated... the combat power cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Looking back at Matsushita Singha at this time, she looked like a devil, with nine ponytails on the back of her head blowing in the wind.</p>

    <p>"This acupuncture method is actually very harmful to the body. Matsushita Singha can actually do this for classmate Liangzi. I am really surprised." A young man holding a small fan walked out from the side.</p>

    <p>Red side. Students from Class S.</p>

    <p>He was wearing a Sword suit. On his chest was his name: Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just glanced at it with the peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming over there sent the detailed information of the person in front of him to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, in this situation, the red side wins by default. Wang Ming has actually calculated based on the winning rate that except Wang Ling and Sun Rong, the remaining five people can be squeezed into the representatives. Finalists of the group.</p>

    <p>And the Ohno Dankaede in front of me is one of them.</p>

    <p>The young man held his arms as if watching a play. The childlike look on his white face was still there. There was also a birthmark in the shape of a maple leaf between his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>I heard that this is the origin of the name Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>The Sword group of Jiudaohe High School is famous all over the world.</p>

    <p>He is one of the main force exporting talents to the national team. As expected, Ohno Dankaede is the next leader of the Jiudaohe High School Sword team.</p>

    <p>In terms of strength in all aspects, Ohno Dankaede is indeed the beauty of the younger generation.</p>

    <p>He is also a genius level person.</p>

    <p>However, compared with Wang Ling, this is still more than a hundred million points behind.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what classmate Liangzi is still hesitating about. Classmate Matsushita Singha is such a good girl. Let's get married." At this time, the young man smiled lightly at the side.</p>

    <p>He looked at the blue side ahead, which had entered the stage of intense civil war, and felt certain in his heart.</p>

    <p>No one expected that this final qualifying match could go on without any effort.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned. There was helplessness in his tone: "But I don't like girls..."</p>

    <p>"Don't. I heard this. Matsushita Singha is so sad."</p>

    <p>At this time, Ohno Dankaede stared ahead. He seemed to feel something.</p>

    <p>I saw only six people on the opposite blue side who were fighting fiercely with Matsushita Singha. Their faces turned pale because of Matsushita Singha's aura that surged again!</p>

    <p>"This..." Several people were extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>I thought that "Nine-Tails Mode" was already the limit of Matsushita Singha's output. But I didn't expect that Matsushita Singha's aura could actually increase again!</p>

    <p>"Ten-Tails...?"</p>

    <p>Several people on the blue side were stunned.</p>

    <p>In fact, they had no idea why Matsushita Singha would be willing to do this.</p>

    <p>This is a unique skill that Matsushita Singha specially cultivated in order to be selected for this delegation. She plans to use it in competitions with other schools.</p>

    <p>Even she herself would not have thought that it would be displayed in such a situation.</p>

    <p>But for classmate Jiugong Liangzi. Everything is worth it!</p>

    <p>When Matsushita Singha showed off this hidden skill.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong had a premonition in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Blue's defeat has been decided.</p>

    <p>Such an aura. It would be no problem for Matsushita Singha to beat the rest of the blue team members.</p>

    <p>Just like this, Matsushita Singha herself will be injured...</p>

    <p>Why on earth is this happening?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that he could not wait until he left the island to show off his cards.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha is so crazy...</p>

    <p>She felt that it would be better if she explained the situation earlier.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stared at the anxious girl beside him, thoughtfully...</p>

    <p>To be honest, the development to this point is beyond Wang Ling's expectation.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Wang Ling himself did not expect that Matsushita Singha in love would be so severely affected.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, this incident happened because of him.</p>

    <p>It's better to let him solve it...</p>

    <p>Mainly because it was the first time Wang Ling saw the girl, who had always been extremely witty, actually showing such a helpless expression next to him.</p>

    <p>For a moment, I felt a little guilty.</p>

    <p>When Matsushita Singha and the six people on the blue side "died together" fell together.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly pointed. An invisible spiritual light shot out at a speed invisible to the naked eye...</p>

    <p>Done all this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's hanging heart. It feels like the dust has settled a lot.</p>

    <p>"Hey. This game is too boring." Ohno Dankaede put away his small fan and stared at the people on the red side with a smile: "I think we shouldn't take action. It's better to save some energy and bring glory to the school."</p>

    <p>"Now the blue team has been eliminated. We have been fighting each other until now. There is no action. Both sides have 0 points."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede said: "And it seems that the current situation is not suitable for taking action. Because there are eight of us. We are originally a team. Whoever takes action against a teammate will have points deducted. Then he will not be qualified to go."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Ohno Dankaede looked at Wang Ling meaningfully.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he doesn't really want Wang Ling to go.</p>

    <p>Their competition at Jiudaohe High School. Why should an exchange student from another school be involved?</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do?" Kongque asked from the side.</p>

    <p>"That's not easy. Let's take turns rolling the dice. The one with the higher number goes." At this moment, Ohno Dankaede smiled meaningfully.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he took out a simple table, three dice and a dice cup from his storage bag.</p>

    <p>As a player who frequents bars, this is almost something that Ohno Dankaede always has.</p>

    <p>"This... this depends too much on luck. I can't do it." A boy named Hattori Zentetsu frowned.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. If you don't know how, I can help you. As long as you trust me." Ohno Dankaede said, "It's all about luck anyway. Do you want to take a gamble?"</p>

    <p>"Come on then." Hattori Zentetsu said dubiously. Anyway, it's all about luck.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Ohno Dankaede smiled.</p>

    <p>He skillfully placed the dice into the dice cup. There was a crisp sound of the dice colliding.</p>

    <p>The results are out.</p>

    <p>"5 6 6!--" Hattori Zentetsu's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>The other people nearby also had incredible looks on their faces.</p>

    <p>The three dice have a maximum of 18 points. Ohno Dankaede helped Hattori Zentetsu to throw 17 points at once. It is already an extremely high number!</p>

    <p>"Since you trust me, of course I won't let you down."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede laughed: "There are others. Do you want me to come?"</p>

    <p>As he said that, he started to shake it again and looked at Sun Rong: "This time I voted for classmate Jiugong. If the number is low, it belongs to me. If the number is high, it belongs to classmate Jiugong."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't have time to refuse. Who knew that this dice cup had already been settled.</p>

    <p>I saw Ohno Dankaede he quickly uncovered.</p>

    <p>The number in front of me is an eighteen-point leopard!</p>

    <p>If casting a high amount of points once is luck, then twice... is strength!</p>

    <p>--Ohno Dankaede knows how to control points!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ohno, you are awesome! Can you help me vote?"</p>

    <p>"Ah. I want it too!"</p>

    <p>The rest of the people followed suit.</p>

    <p>Among the next eight players, only Wang Ling and Ohno Dankaede are left. They have not yet voted.</p>

    <p>Current points record.</p>

    <p>Sorted from high to low.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: 18 points</p>

    <p>Kongque: 17 points</p>

    <p>Hattori Zentetsu: 17 points</p>

    <p>Player 1: 16 points</p>

    <p>Player 2: 16 points</p>

    <p>Player 3: 16 points</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After sorting out the current points earned by everyone, Ohno Dankaede also rolled out his own points.</p>

    <p>No doubt about it. Another 18 point leopard.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this scene. It was already clear in his heart.</p>

    <p>This is Ohno Dankaede trying to embarrass him and push him out.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. Do you do it yourself? Or do you want me to help you?" Ohno Dankaede looked at Wang Ling. He narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart.</p>

    <p>He has not been a gambling god for a long time...</p>

    <p>Why do you have to force him to take action?</p>

    <p>Only eighteen.</p>

    <p>If he takes action.</p>

    <p>The highest number you can get is sixty-three points...</p>
