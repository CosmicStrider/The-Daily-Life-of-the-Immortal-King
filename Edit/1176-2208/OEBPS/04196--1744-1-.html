  <h1>Chapter 1744 Even if it's just a dream...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu's "Dad" was so cordial that it was deafening. Hearing it, Wang Ling could not help but shiver all over.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao looked at the scene in front of him in astonishment. He was stunned. This seemed like a dream. But why this time the dream seemed to be reality...</p>

    <p>And Chen Chao still remembered that he had been kidnapped. The kidnapping process was not a dream, right? After all, Lao Gudong, Teacher Pan and Guo Hao were all captured together.</p>

    <p>Before, Chen Chao never knew what the purpose of the person who caught them here was.</p>

    <p>And now, combined with the scene in front of him, Chen Chao was suddenly enlightened, he couldn't help but look at Wang Ling with a wide open mind, revealing a wry expression that Wang Ling could not describe. "Your son, you're usually so quiet, did you just have a baby and want to surprise everyone?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his mouth. He wanted to explain.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Muyu, trying to use his eyes to coerce the little guy into clarifying.</p>

    <p>But Wang Muyu was not willing to give up. He just looked at him with those watery eyes: "Don't you like this title? Then from now on, I'll just call you daddy! Dad!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Chen Chao. Listen to me. Things are not what you think..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao spread his hands and sighed again. He directly planned to say Sun Rong: "Sun Rong, I know it. Wang Ling he is not a PUA<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Pick Up Artist.)</dfn>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Wang Ling and said, "I've seen it a long time ago. Wang Ling likes you. Even if he doesn't admit it now, he will admit it in the future. But I didn't expect that he would have a baby directly behind our backs..."</p>

    <p>"That face is exactly the same as Wang Ling! What a hammer!"</p>

    <p>"Don't tell me that this child is not Wang Ling's. Even if it is a genetic mutation, it will be difficult to mutate into something that looks exactly like Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>Before he finished speaking, Chen Chao felt his head sink, as if he had been hit hard by something, and he fainted again.</p>

    <p>The person who did it was Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>As Heavenly Dao who controls death. Just when Chen Chao said these words, Death Heavenly Dao had already seen a feeling of death omens overflowing in him.</p>

    <p>So he made a decisive move and helped Chen Chao fall asleep physically.</p>

    <p>Because he vaguely felt that Wang Ling couldn't help but take action. So he took action first... otherwise, it's really hard to say what the outcome would be for Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"There is no other way now. We can only take one step at a time."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao couldn't laugh or cry: "In my humble opinion, I have no choice but to ask Miss Rong and Ling Zhenren to find a way to take care of this little one first."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head and looked at Jin Deng. He tried his best to wink at Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>He swore that he had never made so many expressions in his life.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng understood and nodded quickly. He volunteered and stepped forward and said, "This matter is detrimental to both Ling Zhenren and Miss Rong, and if word of this gets out, people will criticize it. Why don't we let the poor monk take care of him first?"</p>

    <p>When Wang Muyu heard this, he frowned, with an expression of disgust clearly on his face. But when his childish little face was twisted together, it looked like a little bun, and it became even cuter.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng wanted to protect him, but he hugged Sun Rong's neck and refused to get off Sun Rong: "No, no, no. I want to be with mom and dad! I'm not going anywhere!"</p>

    <p>Because he was afraid that pulling hard would hurt Sun Rong and Wang Muyu, Jin Deng had no choice but to let go.</p>

    <p>It's really tricky for such a little kid who suddenly appears.</p>

    <p>"Forget it. How about I take a look... leave it to me."</p>

    <p>Finally. Sun Rong took the initiative to speak out.</p>

    <p>She felt that she should take the blame for this matter. After all, if it weren't for the fact that she was thinking about Wang Ling during the mission.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for the system in the Tian-level laboratory to extract that part of the memory and make a copy of Wang Muyu's appearance according to Wang Ling. "How can this be done? Rongrong."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming firmly objected to this: "This is not the fault of either you or Ling Ling. It's because this little guy misidentified his father and mother. And you, a girl, took this little one with you, just in case you were photographed by those gossip reporters. Sooner or later something will go wrong."</p>

    <p>"So. I have a compromise..."</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong looked at Wang Muyu and asked tentatively: "Muyu, um... are you willing to follow Grandpa?"</p>

    <p>"Great grandpa? Is he mom's grandpa?" Wang Muyu flashed his little eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu crossed his arms and thought for a moment. Then he nodded: "Yes! I do!"</p>

    <p>"You agree now?"Sun Rong was surprised. I didn't expect Wang Muyu to be so easy to talk to.</p>

    <p>"But I have a premise! Mom and dad will go to my great-grandfather's place to see me every few days!"</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also sighed.</p>

    <p>There is no other way.</p>

    <p>I just don't know what Mr. Boss Sun thinks about this matter...</p>

    <p>"Is that possible? Give this little one to Boss Sun?" Wang Ming was also very curious about this.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a moment and then laughed: "I think it's okay... I even think they might get along. Very harmoniously?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, December 29th.</p>

    <p>This was a few days after being harassed by the Dragonborn. Wang Ling seemed to have returned to normal life. But he also knew that this incident did not end.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's existence is a big problem. And. Wang Ling has a premonition that all the next things will happen around Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Currently, the little one is being taken care of by Boss Sun. Wang Ling heard that the relationship is indeed quite harmonious.</p>

    <p>Time returns to the day when Sun Rong brought Wang Muyu to Mr. Boss Sun...</p>

    <p>When they met, Mr. Boss Sun thought that Wang Muyu was the younger brother of Wang Ling. He thought he could get some news about Wang Ling from Wang Muyu. He smiled as brightly as a peach blossom.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most nervous thing was when Wang Muyu called Sun Rong "Mom" at an inappropriate time in front of Boss Sun. Sun Rong almost knelt down when she heard that.</p>

    <p>It turns out that Mr. Sun, the boss, is a very rough and tumble guy. He actually doesn't think anything is wrong at all.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Grandpa... why do you still look so happy?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"What's there to be angry about? This little kid is only six years old. What do you know? Childish words are unbridled."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun hugged Wang Muyu. He liked it very much: "Besides, you're my granddaughter. How can I not know if you're not okay? You've always kept yourself clean. I don't have to worry."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong breathed a sigh of relief: "Wouldn't that be very troublesome Grandpa ... Grandpa don't worry, the little one won't bother you for long, he just always loved alchemy, so he wants to play in our house for two days ..."</p>

    <p>"Why, that's what this is all about, isn't it? Look how nervous you are."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun slapped his thigh: "Ha ha ha! It's okay! I can stay as long as I want! You're busy with your studies, so it's perfect for me to have this little guy to relieve my boredom! Besides, I think I like this little guy at first sight ... I think it's a good idea for you to have such a cute little guy when you grow up and get married!  I will be able to wake up from my dreams with a smile on my face!"</p>

    <p>He hugged Wang Muyu and raised him high: "Little one, do you like alchemy? No problem! Grandpa will teach you how to do it himself!"</p>

    <p>That is, on the same day...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu refined seven mysterious elixirs with the power of a dragon.</p>

    <p>Later, these seven pills were also called the "Seven Dragon Balls"...</p>
