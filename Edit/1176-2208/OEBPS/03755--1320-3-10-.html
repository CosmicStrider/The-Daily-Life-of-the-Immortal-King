  <h1>Chapter 1320 The 10th update on the 3rd anniversary!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Time returns to the top of the sky, Palm Cliff, 4 billion years later.</p>

    <p>Everything is back on track.</p>

    <p>It is already Monday morning, November 30th.</p>

    <p>The horizon ahead. The eastern twilight is approaching and the sun is rising.</p>

    <p>It's gradually dawning.</p>

    <p>When the first ray of sunshine hits Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>What he stepped on was a dried and mutilated marmot fossil...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>Inside the Buddha's Golden Lotus, a girl's excited voice came out: "I knew you would come."</p>

    <p>"Um."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face reflected the red light of the rising sun, covering his complexion.</p>

    <p>He picked up the prairie dog fossil from the ground and shook off the dust.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Thank you Sister Nuan for me!" The girl smiled.</p>

    <p>She knew very well. Although the person who ended this battle was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But there are other people she needs to thank.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded. He cherished words like gold.</p>

    <p>Then he snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>The Buddha Golden Lotus was transported back to the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi and Heavenly Dao were reflecting in the True Venerated Immortal Hall.</p>

    <p>They failed to perform the task of Wang Ling well.</p>

    <p>Because protection is not good.</p>

    <p>So I took the initiative to kneel in the hall of True Venerated Immortal to "please bear my sins."</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why is Elder Zhuo kneeling?"</p>

    <p>"It seems that I didn't see anything well."</p>

    <p>"Did Lord True Venerated Immortal punish you?"</p>

    <p>"The blame lies here! Mr. True Venerated Immortal didn't punish him either. As a result, Elder Zhuo took the initiative to come here to plead guilty..."</p>

    <p>At the entrance of the main hall, many novice disciples came to join in the fun.</p>

    <p>"What are you looking at! Let's look at them all and make a set of {Huanggang Secret Scrolls}!" Fang Xing yelled at the door, folding his arms.</p>

    <p>Several of the male disciples left with red faces. I don't know if it was because of shame or because they woke up...</p>

    <p>Ever since the news about her feminization spread in the Office of Strategic Deception, this kind of thing has happened all the time.</p>

    <p>Previously, Fang Xing only attracted the attention of many female disciples. Now he even attracted the attention of male disciples...</p>

    <p>This made Fang Xing feel very distressed.</p>

    <p>"You two, get up. Classmate Wang Ling didn't say anything." Fang Xing leaned against the door frame. He stared at the scene in the hall and didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>I can only say that whether it is Zhuo Yi or death Heavenly Dao. This desire to live is too strong!</p>

    <p>It's okay to take the initiative to plead guilty...</p>

    <p>This operation made Fang Xing dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"No! Although Master didn't blame me, I can't let myself go! It's because I didn't practice enough and didn't respond enough!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi tried hard to reflect: "Even if I died at that time, Heavenly Dao couldn't react because of the restriction of Heavenly Dao's signal shielding. But I had already noticed something strange! If I had protected Sun Rong earlier, it won't be like this!"</p>

    <p>"No! Although Ling Zhenren didn't blame me, I can't let myself go! It's all because I wasn't prepared enough. I failed to predict the danger in advance!"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao also sighed.</p>

    <p>The two people reflected in the main hall and spoke out their mistakes loudly, as if they were afraid that others would not hear...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing looked amused for a while.</p>

    <p>A few more minutes passed.</p>

    <p>A golden stream of light came quickly from the window.</p>

    <p>It is the Buddha Golden Lotus who has returned!</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Ling Zhenren is indeed Ling Zhenren!</p>

    <p>Saving the sheep from the tiger's mouth. This kind of operation can only be described as awesome Glass!</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao is happy in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although neither he nor Zhuo Yi. were surprised by this result.</p>

    <p>As soon as Zhenren takes action, he will know if there is any.</p>

    <p>How can a mere groundhog stir up waves?</p>

    <p>However, Death Heavenly Dao felt that Zhuo Yi seemed to be much more excited than he imagined!</p>

    <p>Seeing the return of Golden Lotus. Zhuo Yi was so excited that she could hardly contain herself.</p>

    <p>He rushed forward with tears in his eyes!</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior...what's wrong with you^..." Sun Rong was shocked by Zhuo Yi's reaction.</p>

    <p>This was the first time she saw Zhuo Yi acting so glum.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held the Golden Lotus in his hand. He burst into tears and said, "Master Wife! You are finally back!"</p>

    <p>The girl's face turned red. It quickly burned to the base of her ears. Even her snow-white neck was red: "Who... who is your master's wife..."</p>

    <p>After calming down, Zhuo Yi thought about it and felt that he did wake up a little too early.</p>

    <p>Isn't this still undecided...</p>

    <p>But he didn't regret his mistake.</p>

    <p>At least he tried out the girl's will.</p>

    <p>Haha. If you don't mean that to their master! Why are you blushing!</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Sun Rong, schoolgirl. I was too excited." The trick worked. Zhuo Yi showed a smile like an old fox.</p>

    <p>"eh...I don't blame you. From now on...don't call me that..." Sun Rong kept fanning his face with his hands.</p>

    <p>Only this time, it probably took a long, long time for the temperature on my face to subside.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The place abandoned by the gods. Wang Ling threw the mutilated fossilized stems of the prairie dog on the ground.</p>

    <p>Cat in the Abandoned Land saw the dead groundhog. His eyes lit up: "As expected of you!"</p>

    <p>"Has the contract been established?" Wang Ling asked expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>"It has been established! Don't worry, Ling Zhenren! From now on, I will accept Miss Sun's soul according to the order! She is here with me. She will not suffer any injustice or danger! Just as we agreed!" Cat in the Abandoned Land said.</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>He looked at the incomplete fossils of Lord Gray Mist on the ground. In fact, he still had some doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>Let's be honest. Woodchucks are indeed a tough opponent.</p>

    <p>Being able to be resurrected so many times at full status is unimaginable to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He moved the time to 4 billion years ago and killed the prairie dogs.</p>

    <p>This prairie dog's breath has indeed disappeared in the universe.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling feels that there seems to be more to this matter.</p>

    <p>"I know what Ling Zhenren is thinking. Don't worry Zhenren. He is indeed dead."</p>

    <p>Cat in the Abandoned Land said: "Before Ling Zhenren's last palm fell, he actually still had a few lives left. But because Ling Zhenren set the time back...at that point in time, it was not Dao Ancestor who set him up with resurrection privileges. time. So he didn't come back to life."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally breathed a sigh of relief after hearing this.</p>

    <p>The groundhog incident has finally come to an end.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow is Tuesday, December 1st. It is also the time point for the upgrade of the earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling plans to go to the Desert of Dead Bones to take a look at the layout of Monk Jin Deng's Chaos Guidance Device.</p>

    <p>But before leaving. Wang Ling felt like there was one thing that I hadn't done yet...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. In the universe.</p>

    <p>The spirit of the moon and the spirit of the earth face each other from afar.</p>

    <p>Moon Spirit: "I knew it. Ling Zhenren forgot about me..."</p>

    <p>Earth Spirit: "It's better to forget..."</p>

    <p>The Moon Spirit nodded: "That's right... otherwise, I would have to be beaten every day! Look at the pits on my face! Every time he slaps me down, I get scared! I'm much worse off than you! You'll be beaten right away!" It's time to upgrade!"</p>

    <p>"Isn't upgrading just to make it easier to get beaten?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the Earth Spirit's words caused the two planet spirits to fall into a long silence.</p>

    <p>The spirit of the earth sighed: "I have a saying. I started to be afraid of him 4 billion years ago."</p>

    <p>Moon Spirit: "..."</p>
