  <h1>Chapter 2081 The beginning of chaos</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Nearly a dozen ships from different cultivating countries formed a fleet and sailed into the restricted area of the sea in a friendly manner. This scene was shocking. It was enough to be recorded in the annals of history.</p>

    <p>There is already a sense of unity among human beings joining forces to fight against foreign enemies. But the problem is that although it seems to be harmonious on the surface, in fact, all major cultivators in the country have their own evil intentions.</p>

    <p>Don't look at the harmony now. When trouble really comes, it will be revealed who is the true brother with whom.</p>

    <p>In order to facilitate communication, everyone is equipped with a military cultivation magic weapon with simultaneous interpretation function.</p>

    <p>Mainly dominated by the aircraft carriers of the two big brothers, Mixiu Country and Xiongxiu Country. The series of fleets in the rear entered at a certain distance from each other.</p>

    <p>"It's better to act together." At this moment, looking at the chaos in front of him, Yue Lingwei said.</p>

    <p>"Why did you change your mind?" Zhang Zhui asked.</p>

    <p>"Eh... The situation is already in chaos now. It doesn't matter if we act together. They will just treat them as casual cultivators watching the fun." Yue Lingwei said.</p>

    <p>In this situation, joint operations are safer. The main reason is that no one would have expected that so many cultivating countries would be involved in this incident under the leadership of the two major cultivating countries.</p>

    <p>Essentially, they all came with their younger brothers who were allies with them. Most of them were just joining in the fun. They were not really interested in the secrets hidden in the restricted area.</p>

    <p>You always have to give face to your eldest brother. Dare not to not come.</p>

    <p>So now that the situation has become a mess. In addition, there are many casual cultivators in the rear who are interested in the restricted area but dare not easily enter the restricted area. Seeing this opportunity, they all took out their magic weapons to follow. There are even some who went directly to the group fight site and went in with the immortal ship. It was simply outrageous.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Yue Lingwei decided to change his mind at this time and go with Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>After he finished speaking, he immediately took out a golden pill that he had prepared in advance from his lapel. It looked like it was just an ordinary pill.</p>

    <p>However, Zhang Zhui quickly recognized that this was a technological magic weapon born in the context of the modern cultivation era.</p>

    <p>Large appliances can be incorporated into this compact unit through space compression.</p>

    <p>"Compressed Golden Pill?" Zhang Zhui knew. This was something Yue Lingwei had prepared from the beginning. Although he had only lived in the modern world of cultivation for a short time, he had more or less adapted to the rhythm of life here.</p>

    <p>You don't need to guess. Nine out of ten of them contain large-scale surface navigation equipment and the like. With the current comprehensive strength of the Office of Strategic Deception, this is not just an immortal ship. It is a spiritual core-level submarine.</p>

    <p>The level is definitely not too low.</p>

    <p>But if we use aircraft carriers, it would be a bit too much. After all, the Office of Strategic Deception is just a sect. Using aircraft carriers is too exaggerated. It will be criticized by others.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I'll just let you go for a while." Zhang smiled. He looked at Yue Lingwei and straightened himself up a little, tying up his hair.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui actually had quite regular featuresâ€”after all, he was once the man who cuckolded Wang Daozhu...</p>

    <p>When he came out of Corpse Map, he was still very old.</p>

    <p>But now. Zhang Zhui also discovered that the modern world of cultivation seems to be more about appearance.</p>

    <p>So he has paid a little more attention to maintenance recently, trying to restore himself to what he looked like when he was young. Now that he tied his hair up, his overall aura has changed.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei glanced at Zhang Zhui. According to Zhang Zhui's profession, it stands to reason that at this age, he should be worthy of the word "immortal."</p>

    <p>As a result, Zhang Zhui has tied up his hair now. He has no immortal style at all. Instead, he has the feeling of a ruffian cultivating an immortal.</p>

    <p>These days, he is really not afraid of hooligans who are not educated, but he is afraid of hooligans who are well-educated.</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He didn't care about Zhang Zhui's stinky beauty. He just threw the golden pill into the water.</p>

    <p>Along with the rising smoke, Zhang Zhui and those present who had not yet left. The casual cultivators who were gathering together how to join forces to enter the restricted sea area were all shocked by the scene in front of them.</p>

    <p>What did they see...</p>

    <p>Right at the entrance to the sea zone!</p>

    <p>A maritime high-speed train with sixteen carriages actually appeared!!!</p>

    <p>He would never have thought that Yue Lingwei's golden pill could actually conjure something like this.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Let's just say. Isn't this a bit too high-profile..."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. No more exaggeration than an aircraft carrier. We can't use an aircraft carrier. This is the only way."</p>

    <p>"..." The corners of Zhang Zhui's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>If this thing appeared in its entirety on the sea, it would be much more outrageous than an aircraft carrier!</p>

    <p>In fact, it wasn't just Zhang Zhui. Everyone else in the audience also showed incredulous looks.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Muyu covered his face and couldn't bear to look at the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Ha. These two young monks are quite interesting. This is the first time I have seen the Maritime High-Speed Railway. It seems that there are also economically viable talents among the casual cultivators."</p>

    <p>The sword master looked at this scene and sighed with emotion. After saying this, he looked at Wang Muyu who was covering his face: "Muyu, you see, some casual cultivators take out loans to become immortal, while some casual cultivators can reasonably own their own wealth. That's the importance of learning. Knowledge is power. Reading is still very important."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "..."</p>

    <p>Most people didn't know Yue Lingwei and Zhang Zhui. They simply saw that Zhang Zhui was holding Ouyang brothers on his left and right shoulders. They just assumed that these two people were also casual cultivators! And they were traveling together!</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is very likely that these Ouyang brothers hired them to escort them!</p>

    <p>"Tsk... the two Ouyang brothers are richer than they thought. They hired people to help them. And they actually have a maritime high-speed rail? They actually have a strong professional background?"</p>

    <p>"They came prepared. Maybe this trip to the sea restricted area. It's not certain that the two brothers can really break through to the Venerated Immortal realm."</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at this scene and sighed with emotion.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said with shame: "How do you plan to end this? Your carriage, sixteen sections, is too exaggerated."</p>

    <p>Yue Lingqian touched his chin: "It doesn't matter. They've all been misunderstood anyway. Isn't this just right? Can you hide your identity for us?"</p>

    <p>He said via message.</p>

    <p>Then he and Zhang Zhui directly boarded the front of the high-speed train. The Ouyang brothers were piled neatly aside as if they were stacked on top of each other.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Yue Lingwei directly started the external broadcast: "If you have friends who want to get on the train, please feel free to do so. However, in order to maintain the normal operation and maintenance costs of my owner Ouyang's train, each person needs to pay for a ticket to get on the train."</p>

    <p>"Those who are in Soul Formation and below will need to pay 50,000 immortal gold per person. Those who are above pay 100,000 immortal gold per person. However, everyone knows how dangerous the sea restricted area is. We are only responsible for providing vehicles for everyone. If you die on the way, we are not responsible."</p>

    <p>"Of course. If you pay 500,000 immortal gold, we can provide life-saving services once. For such large customers, you can enjoy our special, home-like service."</p>
