  <h1>Chapter 1771 Mine Distribution in Glio City</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling waited in the coffee shop for a while. A man who looked very much like Lord Diulei suddenly pushed the door in from outside. He walked directly towards Wang Ling's table.</p>

    <p>Although it looks similar to Lord Diulei, Wang Ling is certain that this is definitely not Lord Diulei himself. It should be the legendary Mixiu Country Glio City Fenlei.</p>

    <p>Since the Office of Strategic Deception has become the world's largest sect, it has also begun to prepare for foreign territory expansion and the establishment of branch offices.</p>

    <p>However, the history, culture and systems of each cultivation country are different. Therefore, it is not possible to open a branch sect just by thinking about it.</p>

    <p>For example, in Glio City in Mixiu Country, Lord Diulei has encountered a lot of obstacles. However, the sect cannot live without its leader for a day. He also needs his body to take charge of the overall situation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, under such circumstances, once the matter of opening a branch abroad is blocked, Lord Diulei will leave such a "real clone" to perform tasks on his behalf as a branch.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Wang Ling personally taught Lord Diulei this ability, and after the appearance of various types of Thunderbolts, Lord Diulei's work efficiency as the leader has obviously improved a lot.</p>

    <p>"Diulei from Glio City met Ling Zhenren here." As soon as they met, this Glio City Fenlei sent a message and bowed to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, just like the image of Glio City given to most foreigners. At first glance, he looked like an elite among human cultivators.</p>

    <p>As a typical modern metropolis in Mixiu Country that integrates science, technology, and production. Glio City always gives people the impression that it is a gathering of elites.</p>

    <p>People walking on the street seem to always be wearing expensive suits or evening gowns. It makes people feel like they have entered the human world.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until I saw Glio City Fenlei's outfit that Wang Ling realized the problem. No wonder he and Wang Muyu were already low-key enough. They still attracted a lot of strange looks. It turned out to be their outfit was wrong...</p>

    <p>It has to be said that Glio City Fenlei is very skilled in business. He carefully welcomed Wang Ling and Wang Muyu into the car. Then he quickly took out two complete sets of suits from the storage container inside the car. The size was exactly Wang Ling and Wang Muyu's.</p>

    <p>"Please, Ling Zhenren and Brother Muyu, please put them on. Ling Zhenren has always been used to keeping a low profile. If he wears the same clothes as the people here, he will not attract special attention from others." Fenlei from Glio City said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. Then he used a spell to change clothes directly with one snap.</p>

    <p>A very convenient spell. Glio City Fenlei was stunned when he saw it.</p>

    <p>Through the rearview mirror, he saw Wang Ling and Wang Muyu put on suits. The well-tailored black suits perfectly set off the perfect figure of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The spotless white cotton shirt and the red tie made Wang Ling's temperament look much more energetic.</p>

    <p>Coupled with the youthful feeling exuding from the body, this elite-looking suit actually forms a perfect fusion like a Tai Chi plate.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu next to him was basically a smaller version of Wang Ling. Everyone in Glio City was dumbfounded when they saw him.</p>

    <p>After a long while, he started the car. He seemed to have come to his senses and said, "Ah, I'm sorry. This suit fits Ling Zhenren and Muyu brother too well. I don't know what to say next time."</p>

    <p>"The hotel has been arranged. It's a hotel we just purchased. Even if Ling Zhenren and Brother Muyu don't have entry and exit records, they don't have to worry about being traced. The Office of Strategic Deception has already found a way to complete the relevant procedures."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At that moment. Wang Ling suddenly felt that he was guilty.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to buy a package of crispy noodles. The Office of Strategic Deception actually spent so much effort and even booked a hotel for him...</p>

    <p>But after Wang Ling thought for a moment, he suddenly felt something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because the Office of Strategic Deception has invested in many cultivation scientific research projects in the past few months. That thing consumes the most funds. On the other hand, the Heavenly Dao broccoli grown has not yet reached the harvest season.</p>

    <p>Where did he get the spare money to invest in foreign hotel assets? He thought about it carefully. He suddenly felt like he had a bad premonition...</p>

    <p>Then, as soon as he opened his eyes, the pupil power of King's Eyes penetrated directly into the void, helping him peek into the distant scene.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>He saw Sun Rong boarding the immortal boat. She looked like she was in a hurry to go to Glio City.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren actually doesn't have to worry about it. Taking over foreign hotel chains was originally within the scope of the company's expansion plan."</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei said: "By the way. When I was at the door of the store, I saw a woman talking to Brother Muyu. I wonder if Ling Zhenren is familiar with this person?"</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the eyes in the rear view mirror with confusion.</p>

    <p>"If I'm not mistaken, this person should be a well-known variety show producer in Glio. Her name is Michelle Lavin. People give her the nickname Mrs. Lavin. In addition to the technology industry, Glio has a large scale Besides, the entertainment industry is actually very developed."</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei said: "Under normal circumstances, this Mrs. Lavin will not take the initiative to talk to people. If she takes the initiative to come forward like this, it means that she may have set her sights on you, Ling Zhenren, and brother Muyu."</p>

    <p>"Ah? Variety show? Is it one of those TV shows that invites a bunch of popular brothers and sisters to make the audience laugh?" Wang Muyu couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Variety shows are divided into different types. But Brother Muyu is actually right. Variety shows like our current cultivation world are essentially to make the audience laugh and compete for ratings. The directors and producers of these programs will use it to the extreme."</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei said: "This Mrs. Lavin is the producer of a large-scale Zhenren show. According to the latest planning news, this Mrs. Lavin plans to plan a parent-child show."</p>

    <p>"Could it be...{Where is dad going?}" Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei shook his head: "Not really. The news I got here said that the name of the program is {Dad Is Gone}."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Muyu: "???"</p>

    <p>"What Mrs. Lavin is good at is horror variety shows, with the theme of hunting. So she has always been loved by the audience here."</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei said: "The process of this program {Dad Is Gone} is said to be to organize several pairs of fathers and sons to go on a trip. It first enhances the relationship between father and son in an intimate atmosphere. Then there are arranged surprises in the middle."</p>

    <p>"For example, there may be a sudden car accident, knocking dad into a mosaic or something... In short, dads will be eliminated one after another due to various accidents..."</p>

    <p>"Finally, give all the cameras to the children. Let the audience see the children's reaction ability."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This variety show is really produced. Is it good or not? Wang Ling didn't know.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling feels that the producers who plan this kind of program are really short-sighted...</p>

    <p>Even if he had been targeted by Mrs. Lavin, it would be impossible for him to participate in this kind of variety show.</p>

    <p>Besides, his trip is only for one day. He will go back tomorrow.</p>

    <p>There are still school tasks to be completed. The homework is not finished yet...</p>
