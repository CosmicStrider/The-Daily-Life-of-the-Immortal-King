  <h1>Chapter 1695 Comprehensive defense configuration of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling has always had a vague intuition. He feels that some of the major events that have happened recently seem to have come to an end. But they may not have been truly resolved.</p>

    <p>The dark forces behind the scenes may be planning a counterattack. They may form a hemp rope to deal with him.</p>

    <p>It sounds a bit scary.</p>

    <p>It even made Wang Ling feel a little panicked.</p>

    <p>But this panic was not for himself. It was for his family.</p>

    <p>He is indeed very strong. After all, Father Wang and Mother Wang are still ordinary little cultivators who have not even reached the Foundation Building stage. As for his sister Wang Nuan, she is even more of a little kid who has not officially developed.</p>

    <p>Although it is important to accumulate combat experience, after all, it is still in the stage of growth and development. It would not be good if Ah Nuan girl attacks too many times.</p>

    <p>According to teacher Luo Xiang, letting Ah Nuan girl continue to fight may constitute the crime of "employing child labor to engage in hazardous labor."</p>

    <p>This crime. Wang Ling feels that he cannot afford it.</p>

    <p>Therefore Wang Ling feels that it is necessary to make various preparations.</p>

    <p>Not preparing it for myself. But preparing it for the people at home.</p>

    <p>It's obviously not enough to just transform into a monster to control the house. If Father Wang and Mother Wang go out, they may encounter other dangers.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that Wang Ling did not cancel the unicorn arm that was given to Father Wang last time.</p>

    <p>As we all know, this pair of unicorn arms transformed into a unicorn maid.</p>

    <p>One is named Kato.</p>

    <p>One is named Eagle.</p>

    <p>It is now intelligently controlled, and learning ability is extremely strong, through watching movies martial arts video, absorbing all aspects of the fighting experience, Wang Ling heard that recently Father Wang's one inch punch is very strong, fist to the flesh and hand speed is extremely fast, and the movie that kung fu star almost no difference, and even once there is beyond the frame.</p>

    <p>Of course. This is an effect that can only be achieved when the Kirin Arm is activated.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the Kirin Arms are invisible.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is to prevent the Kirin maid transformed from the Kirin Arm from destroying the harmonious relationship between husband and wife.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is also to prevent Father Wang from accidentally breaking the keyboard while typing.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Now only when encountering life-threatening situations, the Kirin Arm will be automatically triggered and activated.</p>

    <p>All in all, compared to Mother Wang, Father Wang still has certain self-defense capabilities.</p>

    <p>However, in general, it is still not enough.</p>

    <p>The enemies we face now are no longer the self-respecting bugs in the corners of the earth.</p>

    <p>All of them are cosmic-level bosses, creatures from the old factions, the Eternals, etc...</p>

    <p>When meeting these people, all aspects of defense must be comprehensive.</p>

    <p>Previously, when Wang Nuan was born, Fenmu Shen wanted to take action against Mother Wang. In fact, this gave Wang Ling a very important revelation.</p>

    <p>He felt it was time to pay some attention to his parents.</p>

    <p>It was Friday, December 26th. Wang Ling took an unprecedented leave of absence and did not go to school.</p>

    <p>It was obviously his birthday, but he was worried about the safety of his parents and the overall defense of the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang were very moved.</p>

    <p>Because it's Wang Ling's birthday. I actually thought of giving them gifts.</p>

    <p>Although the gift is thermal underwear...</p>

    <p>To be honest. This is the inspiration Wang Ling got from Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>During this trip to the Science and Technology City, Zhuo Yi put on all the thermal underwear he gave Zhou Ziyi layer by layer in order to avoid danger.</p>

    <p>It directly turned Zhou Ziyi into a "Michelin tire."</p>

    <p>However, the results were surprisingly good.</p>

    <p>For the defenseless Father Wang and Mother Wang, thermal underwear is indeed the best choice.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling has made a new and improved version of the thermal underwear for this gift!</p>

    <p>Directly upgraded to version 5.0!</p>

    <p>The updates and improvements are as follows:</p>

    <p>1:5.0 version of thermal underwear. The defense power will be the normal defense power of 10 sets of thermal underwear.</p>

    <p>2: There is no need to consider the problem of restraint.</p>

    <p>One set on the body can directly lock all parts of the body for thorough protection. </p>

    <p>3: In case of emergency danger, the stand-in attack mode can be activated. At that time, thermal underwear will summon powerful stand-in bodyguards to protect you in all directions...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it is the backyard and front yard of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>After returning from the Science and Technology City, the 096 that recognized Ah Nuan as its owner was also brought back by Wang Ling. It is currently being raised in the backyard.</p>

    <p>096 is a rabbit-eared creature that was originally in human form. Wang Ling taught 096 the method of shape-changing, allowing it to transform into a cute rabbit on its own.</p>

    <p>It's only the size of a teacup. It's snow-white. And it looks harmless. But you can still tell it's 096 from the action of covering its face.</p>

    <p>In other words, the Wang family's yard now has Er Ha in the front yard and 096 in the back yard.</p>

    <p>One dog and one rabbit serve as security guards. Such a configuration is unheard of.</p>

    <p>"What should I do with the feed?" At this time, Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>Compared with 096. Er Ha's private chats are regularly provided by Guo Hao. And now that he has become a mythical beast, in addition to ordinary private chats, he can also supplement it by absorbing the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>But 096 is different. Although this kind of sheltered creature is theoretically the product of Chaos, in the eyes of Chaos, it is a mistake born from Chaos.</p>

    <p>Therefore, their own attributes are actually a bit strange. They are not compatible with Chaos. The power of Chaos cannot provide 096 normal energy subsidies.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has already thought of this.</p>

    <p>He took out a grass seed from his pocket and sown it directly in the backyard.</p>

    <p>This grass seed shocked 096 and Er Ha at the same time.</p>

    <p>"It's actually Tomb Grass..." Er Ha was completely stunned.</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>This grass seed of Tomb Grass was given by Leng Ming. It itself was transformed from Tomb Grass. Naturally, it also prepared some grass seeds.</p>

    <p>The principle is similar to the principle of plucking a monkey's hair to create a monkey grandchild...</p>

    <p>The key is that Tomb Grass is different from ordinary grass. It is not a product of chaos, but it can grow infinitely by absorbing various energies such as chaos, spiritual power, and original energy.</p>

    <p>As long as there is enough energy, it is a perpetual motion machine that can continue to grow taller.</p>

    <p>It is definitely enough to be used as feed for 096.</p>

    <p>As for the issue of growth. Wang Ling also prepared a "chaos shower." The space inside the showerhead connects to the universe. It will regularly absorb the power of chaos in the universe.</p>

    <p>096 cannot absorb the power of chaos to replenish its own energy. Then use this chaos shower. Water the tomb grass first. After the tomb grass is fertilized, it can be directly harvested for feed.</p>

    <p>Of course, apart from Er Ha and 096 guards, the external defenses of the Wang family's villa are obviously not enough.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling also took out a pair of red paintings from his "King's Pants" and pasted them on the backyard and front yard.</p>

    <p>The painting shows a pair of old men with beards. They look a bit like Lao K from playing cards. It is a common type of defensive magic weapon. Generally speaking, the creatures sealed in the painting are a bit like "ghosts." It's just that these "ghosts" have been purified through artificial processing. They are tamed and docile.</p>

    <p>Take the pair of paintings that Wang Ling took out.</p>

    <p>This magic weapon is called "Guo Shi Wushuang."</p>

    <p>Regarding the old men in the painting, one is carrying a missile launcher and the other is holding a Gatling gun. They look very mighty and majestic.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that in addition to the antithetical couplets, there is also a couplet on it.</p>

    <p>It reads:</p>

    <p>"Shooting the demons in all directions and crippling them"</p>

    <p>"The bombardment of exquisite Wuhu took off from all sides"</p>
