  <h1>Chapter 1786 Death of Meili</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the luxurious suite of the Volute Hotel in Glio City. Accompanied by the news of the latest instructions from the Cultivation Police Station in Glio City. Wang Ling, Sun Rong and all other people from Number 60 High School are restricted. Appearing on camera. Not allowed to leave Mixiu Country.</p>

    <p>This incident was mainly aimed at Sun Rong. The other people were implicated. It was mainly a disguised threat against Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, everyone. They came for me... I originally wanted to take everyone out to have fun. I didn't expect that everyone would be implicated..." Sun Rong is quite self-conscious, if she had known this was the case, she would not have come all the way here, but she did not think that she would have caused trouble for all of us.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that it caused trouble for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Recently, she felt that her relationship with Wang Ling had finally improved. But something like this happened again today. She wonders if it would lower her favorability in his heart?</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Boss Sun, don't worry too much. Even if you can't go out, it's good to enjoy the delicious food in the hotel." Chen Chao and Guo Hao expressed their opinions one after another.</p>

    <p>"That's right. It's okay Rongrong. These people are just jealous because your family is doing so well. We have plenty of time. I believe you can handle it well." Li Youyue also agreed.</p>

    <p>If you can go out, then go out and play. If you can't go out, then it's fine to turn on the homebody mode and stay at home. As for Li Youyue, it doesn't matter as long as she can learn new cooking. The mentality of these people is much better than Sun Rong imagined.</p>

    <p>"Thank you everyone for trusting me. I will solve this trouble as soon as possible." Sun Rong showed a happy smile. Then she looked at Butler Lin beside her: "Uncle Lin, what is the situation now? How are we? Can we meet the truck driver?"</p>

    <p>"Currently, we are still communicating. The cultivation Police Station in Glio City said that they are still starting the investigation process... They have arranged for a lawyer to meet with the truck driver. However, the situation is not good. There is a possibility that they will not be able to meet with them at all. " Butler Lin frowned.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that this group of people came prepared. They deliberately arranged this incident and used the method of forcible detention.</p>

    <p>And the accusation is extremely serious. If you don't find a way to clarify the facts and use other means to slip out of the Mixiu Country, I'm afraid it will lead to deeper misunderstandings. It will also have a negative impact on the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception in international public opinion. Extremely adverse effects.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is certainly aware of the stakes in this matter.</p>

    <p>He didn't blame Sun Rong in his heart. Because all this was just the general trend.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, he vigorously promoted Lord Diulei to establish the Office of Strategic Deception. He also supported the cooperation between Lord Diulei and the Huaguo Shuilian Group. He just wanted to use the Office of Strategic Deception to provide himself with greater cover.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the development of the Office of Strategic Deception is getting stronger and stronger. When the attention of cultivators around the world is focused on the Office of Strategic Deception, the backlash encountered in Glio City is also within Wang Ling's expectation.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't expect that the other party would use such a method to forcibly detain them.</p>

    <p>He thought about it carefully. It seems that it is very popular among Western cultivators to use this method of hostage diplomacy... No matter what, the will put a label on you first. As for other matters, we can slowly negotiate until, until one party completely gives in.</p>

    <p>And there is obviously no evidence for all this.</p>

    <p>The same goes for the case where the Cultivation Police Station in Glio City accused Sun Rong of murder. From beginning to end, there was only one false testimony from the truck driver.</p>

    <p>"The worst thing that can happen now is the truck driver. He is the only witness. If it cannot be proved that he has testified, it will be difficult for us to prove our innocence. Moreover, if the truck driver has an accident, we will not be able to tell the truth." Fang Xing touched his chin and analyzed calmly.</p>

    <p>"What Mr. Fang said makes sense." Butler Lin nodded: "So our Huaguo Shuilian Group also applied for a witness protection order. But it's hard to say whether the cultivation General Police Station in Glio City will enforce it or not."</p>

    <p>"This group of people is inherently xenophobic. They shouldn't listen to us, right?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed: "I just asked an uncle of mine who works at the cultivation Police Station in Glio City. He obviously had a good relationship with me before. But this time he didn't tell me anything. Let me be honest. He said he would find a way to get me out of the relationship and return to Huaxiu."</p>

    <p>"You actually have a foreign uncle?" Everyone was shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"Back then, my grandma gave birth to more than thirty children. My father was the fifteenth oldest in the family. Now the Guo family has spread. Naturally, my uncles are all over the world."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Butler Lin was stunned for a long time. Then he answered: "Classmate Guo's family... is really powerful... but your uncle doesn't want to talk to you more. He also has his own concerns because of the power of this matter. The structure is too complex."</p>

    <p>"According to the information I have received so far, this matter is led by the local Chilan Society in Glio City. This is the largest local mafia. It has several high-quality mercenary groups."</p>

    <p>"Levius, the president of the Chilan Society, was a famous captain in the past. However, once he sailed a ship and blocked a huge ship in the canal, causing a huge blockage. As a result, the whole world suffered huge economic losses."</p>

    <p>"Later, Levi was dismissed from his post. All his family property was confiscated as a punishment. His wife and children were separated. He was imprisoned in the Glio City Prison. The result was disastrous. He was allowed to make a fortune again in the prison. Now he has become the president of the Chilan Association..."</p>

    <p>"But he's just a mafia boss. The government in Glio City won't be obedient, right?" Fang Xing said.</p>

    <p>"So that's where the trouble begins."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said: "Behind this matter, it is very likely that the church in Glio City is involved. In Glio City, the church is the symbol of real power. If the church steps forward, it will force the cultivation Police Station to do something." Even if it is unreasonable, there is nothing we can do about it. But what makes me a little confused now is that our Huaguo Shuilian Group has never had any grudges with the church. Why are we being targeted by the church?"</p>

    <p>"Could it be related to Tengu?" At this time, Wang Muyu raised his hand obediently.</p>

    <p>"Muyu's judgment is correct."</p>

    <p>And this answer is exactly what Fang Xing wanted to say: "When there is no grudge, it is unreasonable for the church to choose to intervene."</p>

    <p>"The only possibility is that there may be Tengu people in the church. The Tengu tried to kidnap classmate Sun Rong but failed. On the way to Glio City, classmate Sun Rong tried to shoot down immortal Funaya with a missile."</p>

    <p>"Now that classmate Sun Rong has come to Glio City, it is like putting a bird in a birdcage. Naturally, they will not miss this opportunity."</p>

    <p>"We will naturally handle Miss Rongrong's matter. What I am more worried about than Miss Rongrong's is the safety of you all."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin said. He immediately looked at Wang Ling and Wang Muyu: "Before the result comes out, please ask Mr. Wang Ling and Mr. Muyu to wait in the hotel and don't move around... These mafia are very excessive, Mr. Wang Ling and Mr. Muyu are so cute, if they fall into the hands of these mafia, they might have something missing that they can take and sell."</p>
