  <h1>Chapter 1607 The person who is the elder brother</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, I have never even thought about having another disciple.</p>

    <p>But he knew. In fact, with Zhuo Yi's current career development in full swing.</p>

    <p>After more and more people admire Zhuo Yi. When Zhuo Yi's own light is enough to illuminate the world.</p>

    <p>This kind of thing is actually unavoidable.</p>

    <p>I heard about Zhou ZiyiWang Ling when I was in Sun Island.</p>

    <p>This was a condition put forward in order to win over the teacher named Zhou Xiang.</p>

    <p>The fat that Wang Ling rubbed off from his body in those years is actually a versatile raw material for body shaping. You only need to take a little bit to reconnect the residual limbs, or even create a new body.</p>

    <p>Later, when helping Li Xian, Zhang Zhui and others shape their bodies.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling planned to reuse the fat "waste" that he had rubbed off his body before.</p>

    <p>Even the physical body of the eternal strong man can be reshaped. Refitting a broken leg is just a matter of effort for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>However, Zhuo Yi did not ask Wang Ling to do this after comprehensive consideration. Instead, he asked Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi to find out how to "seed legs."</p>

    <p>It's a leg technique from the Divine Realm. The effect is similar to Wang Ling's. It just lacks speed and strength.</p>

    <p>If the grown leg is attached by the fat from Wang Ling's body.</p>

    <p>Once these legs are normalized, they'll be a pair of invincible legs...</p>

    <p>Although the method in the God's Domain is a bit slow and inconsistent, it is still the idea of a few Dao Gods. It is not bad after it really grows. And it can surpass most of the earth's monks.</p>

    <p>At first, Wang Ling heard about all the things Zhuo Yi did to help Zhou Ziyi. I just felt that he had a special sense of concern for the young man who had broken his leg.</p>

    <p>At that time Wang Ling faintly noticed some signs.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that Zhuo Yi would tell him about accepting a disciple so quickly.</p>

    <p>And it was on the first day after he returned to Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is thinking carefully with his chin raised. In fact, he is also thinking about the feasibility of this matter.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Zhou Ziyi. How do you feel after being contacted by senior Zhuo Yi?" In the car, Wang Ling fell into silence. Sun Rong beside him asked quickly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi mentioned the matter of accepting a disciple in person. He had no intention of avoiding Sun Rong. In fact, he also wanted Sun Rong to help him say some nice words.</p>

    <p>And the girl also received this signal, so she chose to speak out at this time.</p>

    <p>"He is a very smart person. He is very similar to me when I was young." Zhuo Yi commented.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi responded quickly. This made Zhuo Yi particularly fond. Of course, what he liked most was Zhou Ziyi's positive and optimistic attitude.</p>

    <p>Ever since I entered work and was even given the aura of a hero. Zhuo Yi feels like my edges have been smoothed by life.</p>

    <p>However, he felt a bit of his own youth in Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>So he had this idea in his mind at that time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can hear it. This is not a lie.</p>

    <p>The question and answer between Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi is a bit like a cross talk.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi's answer is still very sincere.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi knew. This matter was actually said quite suddenly. So after expressing his opinion, he still said haha: "Master, I just want to ask for your opinion first... If you think it's not okay... It doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>As a result, the tone of his conversation with Wang Ling suddenly became respectful. This made Wang Ling a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed a bit sudden...but I think so. If you keep Ziyi by your side and push him out to be a talented boy, then all eyes will be on Ziyi. The same goes for you, Master." It's a good cover..."</p>

    <p>Um...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded silently in his mind.</p>

    <p>This is true.</p>

    <p>He had heard before that Zhou Ziyi's talent for cultivation was actually quite good. Even with a broken leg, he could still keep up with the level of a normal Earth monk at a normal age.</p>

    <p>If there is no broken leg, the basic talent should be about the same as Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, for the sake of caution, Wang Ling still did not agree directly.</p>

    <p>He still decided to investigate for a while before talking about it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was already past nine o'clock in the evening when Wang Ling got home.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, he felt a soft glutinous rice ball hugging his feet. Then it climbed up skillfully. It didn't stop until it reached his shoulders and rested peacefully on his body.</p>

    <p>Then she kept rubbing her fair and pink face on his cheek, like a little milk cat.</p>

    <p>This kind of very close contact has always been taboo for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But the strange thing is that Wang Nuan being so close to him didn't make Wang Ling feel like he wanted to push the little girl away.</p>

    <p>So much so that Wang Ling began to have such an idea in his mind.</p>

    <p>He thinks his sister is too cute...</p>

    <p>It's nice to have a sister...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is undeniable. This is most likely due to the power of blood relationship.</p>

    <p>Of course there is a more important point.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl was born not long ago.</p>

    <p>But he and his sister have already fought side by side.</p>

    <p>At that time, Ah Nuan's shadow was also lying on his shoulder like this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that maybe it was from that time that Ah Nuan developed some kind of dependence on him.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang were holding various toys in their left and right hands. It looked like they were preparing to put the little girl to sleep.</p>

    <p>Both of them were tortured badly. Their hair was messy.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Nuan suddenly became quiet. Father Wang and Mother Wang both breathed a sigh of relief, but were also surprised in their hearts.</p>

    <p>"It's strange...Ling Ling, have you already met Ah Nuan? She seems to be very dependent on you." Mother Wang couldn't help covering her mouth and smiled.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling went home, what the couple was most worried about was whether the siblings could live in peace.</p>

    <p>Now seeing such a heartwarming scene, Father Wang and Mother Wang instantly knew that they were overthinking.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, the little girl who was noisy before suddenly crawled all the way over like a cat smelling fish.</p>

    <p>Then he lay on Wang Ling's shoulder. He closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep...</p>

    <p>This scene moved Father Wang and Mother Wang very much.</p>

    <p>The two couldn't help but take out their mobile phones and take pictures. The famous warm scene of the brother and sister living in harmony was filmed from all angles.</p>

    <p>"Eh... My dear. You said Ah Nuan girl can only sleep on your shoulder now. What should I do? You still have to go to school." After the video. Father Wang was getting worried.</p>

    <p>Right now Ah Nuan is still growing and developing.</p>

    <p>If I can only sleep on Wang Ling's shoulder. It's not good for growth and development.</p>

    <p>"Why don't we let you take Ah Nuan with you when you go to school? Bring Ah Nuan along?" Mother Wang suddenly suggested.</p>

    <p>Father Wang clapped his hands. He called out to the insiders: "Yes! I think it's fine! Consider it as pre-school education!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
