  <h1>Sun Rong and Wang Nuan} Extra 5: Behind the scenesÂ·Wang Nuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Songhai city center. In a cafe in a large shopping mall.</p>

    <p>A long-legged young man wearing a mask and sunglasses and covering himself tightly walked in.</p>

    <p>He looked around and finally locked in a position. He came to a little girl to confirm the connection code.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Use one word to describe the author of {The Daily Life of the Immortal King}!"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan: "Short!"</p>

    <p>Great. Confirmation complete!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded with satisfaction. Then he sat down naturally and snapped his fingers to the waiter next to him: "A cup of coffee."</p>

    <p>"Sir, we can DIY coffee here. What flavor do you want?"</p>

    <p>"Take a glass of iced blueberry. Thank you very much!"</p>

    <p>Waiter: "Okay...ok..."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan couldn't help but snicker. I'm afraid Brother Ming's bad attributes cannot be changed.</p>

    <p>They are obviously married people!</p>

    <p>"Where's Mrs. Zhai Yin?" Wang Nuan asked, taking a sip of the salty lemonade on the table.</p>

    <p>"Today's pregnancy test. I was going to accompany her, but you suddenly called me. Yinzi said she could just go by herself. She pushed me here." Wang Ming smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"I'm so sorry, sister-in-law..." Wang Nuan blushed and felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. They are all members of the family. And she knows very well that you came to me probably because of Ling Ling's matter." Wang Ming raised his chin and said, "I heard that you played a big game of chess?"</p>

    <p>"It's just about creating opportunities."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan chuckled and said, "Today's parent-teacher meeting was really lively!"</p>

    <p>"It seems that Eternal Talisman is very useful."</p>

    <p>"Very powerful! My brother has already fallen into the trap!" Wang Nuan said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"This is my confident work. It is very strong. As long as it sticks on, there is no need to worry about losing control. And the software can be used to automatically adjust the sealing strength. When strength is needed, it can also be liberated."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "And the most important thing is that as long as your brother has posted it, you don't need to post it. Eternal Talisman will automatically form a seal on the blood-related psychic overflowers based on the DNA gene chain. Of course, your power It can also be controlled through the software terminal."</p>

    <p>"That's why I came to see Brother Ming."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Nuan said seriously: "I may need to temporarily lift the restrictions. This is the last step of the big plan."</p>

    <p>"You little girl. You really like to worry."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help but laugh. He stared at Wang Nuan. There was some depth in his eyes: "Although you look only ten years old, I feel that you have deep thoughts. Tell me, girl. After all. What's going on? You can't lie to me."</p>

    <p>"It's the relationship between Shadow and Fate..."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Wang Ming understood instantly: "Fate itself can only see its own state in other parallel spaces. But you have mastered the power of shadow, so you can indirectly see other people..."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan stuck out his tongue and muttered: "At first, I was just curious! But when I read it, it was like reading a novel. I couldn't stop at all..."</p>

    <p>"So, what would it be like if Ling Ling was in other parallel dimensions?"</p>

    <p>"I've seen every thread in every universe. 33.33% of my brother died alone, 33.33% was single for a thousand years, and 33.33% was arranged to go on a blind date and get married with someone who doesn't have any affection..."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan raised his eyebrows: "The whole world is giving birth. Only my brother has nothing..."</p>

    <p>"His character is not surprising..."</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Wang Ming raised his forehead together.</p>

    <p>"You said a total of 99.99% of the situation...where are the 0.01%?"</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan's face felt a little hot: "Of course I'm with Sister Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>"The probability is so low?!" Wang Ming was surprised.</p>

    <p>"So, every next step cannot go wrong. It must be in the process of gradually releasing my brother's emotions, so that he can fully understand himself." Wang Nuan answered.</p>

    <p>"But do you think this ending is what he wants?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming held his chin and thought: "And the current emotions are slowly released because they were too deeply suppressed in the past. Those emotions that have never been expressed in the past will be stronger than normal after they are released. The increase...maybe...maybe it's not his true wish."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan crossed his arms and frowned: "So! Just to confirm this, I have to take the last step of the big plan! So now, I need more strength!"</p>

    <p>"Tell me. What do you want to do?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>Compared to Wang Ling's powerful spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl's Shadow ability is actually more gentle. As long as it is carefully controlled, there will be no accidents in the short term even if it is fully released.</p>

    <p>But in order to avoid unexpected situations, such as the earth blowing up again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that it would be better if he fully understood the whole plan.</p>

    <p>"That's it. Create a new earth." Wang Nuan's words were concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>"Are you really going to blow up the earth?" Wang Ming was startled.</p>

    <p>At this time, the waiter from the previous coffee shop came over with coffee: "Sir...your variegated root latte."</p>

    <p>He actually didn't hear it very clearly.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming's words "You really want to blow up the earth" almost made him knock over his coffee cup in shock.</p>

    <p>Then, the waiter glanced at the cousin duo who were plotting with a very strange look, then put down the coffee and left with a suspicious look on his face.</p>

    <p>"It's not like it blew up. It just meant that the civet cat was replaced by the prince..."</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the waiter completely left that Wang Nuan said to Wang Ming in a low voice.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, she was prepared.</p>

    <p>He immediately took out a fully written plan from his pink schoolbag that looked like a treasure chest: "This is my plan."</p>

    <p>"The preparation is quite detailed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised the corners of his lips. He glanced at the top of the plan. The title of Douda: {The Last Beam of Light Breaking Through the Shadows}</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan...are you writing a romance novel?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the plan roughly. Then his expression gradually became serious: "Ah Nuan. I think it would be better if we change the place to talk."</p>

    <p>"Agree." Wang Nuan nodded and stood up with his schoolbag on his back.</p>

    <p>She glanced at the weird-looking coffee shop waiter over there: "How to deal with this person?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming whispered: "I raise my hand. You raise your leg..."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan: "Do you want to kill me? Brother Ming, you are so cruel!"</p>

    <p>"Just kidding..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Just use the amnesia technique."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The waiter stood very far away. In fact, he couldn't hear what Wang Nuan and the others were saying.</p>

    <p>However, he could feel that there was a particularly eye-catching word "danger" hanging above his head...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, facing the night.</p>

    <p>The parent-teacher conference of Number 61 Affiliated Primary School is about to begin.</p>

    <p>Each class has its own small auditorium for parent-teacher conferences.</p>

    <p>After dinner in the cafeteria, Wang Ling and Sun Rong arrived early under the guidance of Teacher Zhuang.</p>

    <p>They chose a corner position. Wang Ling stepped aside and let Sun Rong sit inside.</p>

    <p>Among the parents who entered the venue one after another, a dark-skinned young man entered and scanned Sun Rong.,</p>

    <p>He walked over quickly and touched his head: "Hello. Which classmate are you the parent of...Why haven't I seen you before?"</p>

    <p>"Ah. I'm here to hold a meeting on your behalf." Sun Rong responded with an awkward yet polite smile.</p>

    <p>"What a coincidence. Me too!" The young man felt that he had found a topic.</p>

    <p>This is the skill of striking up a conversation.</p>

    <p>In situations like parent-teacher conferences, as long as you have skills, you can still strike up a conversation smoothly.</p>

    <p>And this... is one of the purposes of his coming to the parent-teacher meeting this time.</p>

    <p>He saw Sun Rong at a glance and judged from her age. Sun Rong was most likely here to hold a parent-teacher conference. After all, such a young and beautiful girl still maintains such a perfect figure. It is very important to have children. Rare cases.</p>

    <p>"So after the parent-teacher meeting, do you have time to go... have a cup of tea?"</p>

    <p>The dark-skinned young man approached with an attentive look on his face, wanting to sit down next to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Seeing this. Wang Ling moves. Take the first step to grab the position.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he looked at him with a somewhat cold gaze and replied: "No."</p>

    <p>...</p>
