  <h1>Chapter 1420 Sun Rong's Passive Skills</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It's not surprising that Sun Ying'er has such a peculiar mind.</p>

    <p>Because the sword spirit and the sword spirit see each other and want to breed a new sword spirit, they can enter chaos with each other. There is no process of two-person movement in the human world.</p>

    <p>So in theory, two sword spirits of the same gender can also give birth to new sword spirits.</p>

    <p>In fact, although there are differences between men and women in the image of Sword Spirit.</p>

    <p>Now in the Sword King Realm, the gender of the sword spirit is only based on appearance.</p>

    <p>But essentially, all sword spirits are asexual. There is no real gender distinction.</p>

    <p>Faced with Sun Ying'er's unintentional offense, Wu Jin and Lao Man didn't pay much attention.</p>

    <p>After all, Leng Ming's appearance was very sudden.</p>

    <p>I wonder if Sun Rong and others still don't know about Leng Ming's existence.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun doesn't know. This child's name is Leng Ming. He is the new sword spirit born in the Sword King Realm. He was not born between us..." Wu Jin laughed. He thought of what Sun Rong just said. That picture There was a slight blush on the face of the sissy sign.</p>

    <p>Lao Man rolled his eyes on the side.</p>

    <p>You blush like a bubble teapot!</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be the newly conceived little sword spirit. So cute!" Sun Rong squatted down and gently touched Leng Ming's face. Leng Ming was a little embarrassed and shrank shyly behind Wu Jin.</p>

    <p>While touching Leng Ming's soft cheek.</p>

    <p>Aohai's "moisturizes things silently" passive ability is activated.</p>

    <p>The invisible sword energy penetrated into Leng Ming's body. Sun Rong felt that his eyes were in a trance. Suddenly he could see Leng Ming's appearance clearly.</p>

    <p>This passive skill of "moisturizing things silently" is the first time Aohai has shown it. It mainly uses a specific sword energy to identify. And this sword energy has the power to remove the false and retain the true, and see through illusions.</p>

    <p>But not invincible. Not all illusions can be detected.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes also has such power. But in comparison, "Moisturizing Things Silent Sword Qi" is still far behind.</p>

    <p>And now this power is fed back to the girl under the influence of the passive version of "Human and Sword Fusion."</p>

    <p>This makes Sun Rong also possess the ability to "moisten things silently."</p>

    <p>It can be said that there is almost no distinction between Aohai and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>All the passive abilities Aohai has. Sun Rong also has them.</p>

    <p>"The little guy turned into a small piece of grass?"Sun Rong rubbed his eyes. He was sure that he had seen it right.</p>

    <p>"Even though Leng Ming is small, he actually has a great future. If he waits for him to grow up, even a piece of grass can kill the sun, moon and stars."</p>

    <p>Wu Jin touched Leng Ming's little head and said, "Oh, by the way. Miss Sun still doesn't know that Lord Jingke has agreed to take Leng Ming as his disciple, right?"</p>

    <p>"Have you accepted him as a disciple?"Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Lao Man nodded: "In fact, this is the sword king's protection for him. Otherwise, this little guy would be targeted by so many evil people. These days, there are so many pedophiles and perverts. No matter you are a boy or a girl, you must protect yourself."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded. Couldn't agree more.</p>

    <p>Then it glanced at Sun Rong again: "You don't know? I remember I sent you a text message."</p>

    <p>"Ah...sorry. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Fu'an: "Don't worry. I know this is a separate price. I will settle the bill with you additionally."</p>

    <p>In the past two days, she had been too focused on dealing with Jiang Yingying, which distracted her a lot of energy.</p>

    <p>"Boss?" Wu Jin and Lao Man looked puzzled at the same time.</p>

    <p>They hadn't seen each other for a few days. They felt that the relationship between Sun Rong and Er Ha suddenly became complicated.</p>

    <p>"Now she is my boss. And I am committed to collecting intelligence and reporting to my boss." Er Ha replied.</p>

    <p>"What about Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>"Lord Ling is naturally my boss as well. Lord Ling is my spiritual boss. Miss Sun is my material boss." Er Ha's answer was full of desire to survive.</p>

    <p>Wu Jin and Lao Man understood instantly: "A boss. A boss's wife. Is that what you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Almost." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>"Stop talking nonsense!"Sun Rong was helpless.</p>

    <p>I went around in a big circle just to tease her. There was no one else...</p>

    <p>Everyone waited in Sun Rong's Tianzi room for about five or six minutes. Then they saw a graceful and sexy woman wearing a leather tights walking out holding a crystal ball. Come in.</p>

    <p>The person coming is none other than Carter.</p>

    <p>"The bronze group stage is about to begin. I'll take Leng Ming there."</p>

    <p>Carter said. She put the crystal ball in her hand on the table: "This ball can be used for live broadcast. Everyone can also see the situation in the sword fighting arena in the room."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Senior Carter." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>"You're welcome, Miss Sun. Please work hard for today's game. According to the schedule, the showdown between the champion group is the last group."</p>

    <p>After Carter finished the introduction, he took Leng Ming's hand and left. He looked very nervous. When he left the room, Sun Rong could see the cold sweat streaming down his forehead.</p>

    <p>"Is the little guy really okay... He seems more nervous than me." Sun Rong was a little worried.</p>

    <p>"It's the first time to engage in a melee. It's inevitable to be nervous," Wu Jin said.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, is there really no problem with the combat power? I remember that this kid just has a relatively high talent value. In the melee stage, the test is still the actual combat power." Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"It is said that Mr. Jingke and Mr. Bai Qiao gave Leng Ming special training before the Sword Competition. It should not be a problem to win the first place in the bronze group." Wu Jin was silent for a while and said.</p>

    <p>"It's only been less than two days..." Er Ha was surprised.</p>

    <p>"You underestimate Leng Ming's talent. For a genius, he can learn more in 2 hours than some people can learn in 200 days." Wu Jin replied.</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha couldn't refute these words, because it was indeed the case.</p>

    <p>About ten more minutes passed.</p>

    <p>The picture of the magic ball was projected onto the grand ancient Sword City Sword Arena. Countless sword spirits were seated in the audience area. It was dazzling. Every corner seemed to be filled. Like sardines!</p>

    <p>In less than 2 days, it was possible to expand the Sword Conference to such a scale.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, the organizational ability of Jiu You and others is indeed strong. On the other hand, the attractiveness of Jian Shen Alloy is indeed high!</p>

    <p>The Sword Contest is about to begin!</p>

    <p>At the same time, in Room Number 2, Tianzi, next door to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is also watching the game.</p>

    <p>His King's Eyes are like projectors, directly projecting the images captured on the screen into the void.</p>

    <p>And on the table in the room, there are various flavors of... crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>Jingke beside him sighed silently: "Sword Master, why don't you go next door to say hello?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>He didn't come here for Sun Rong in the first place.</p>

    <p>I just wanted to see Leng Ming's performance.</p>

    <p>Then, by the way, help Sun Rong to check whether there are any suspicious elements preventing her from winning the first place.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Just by the way...</p>
