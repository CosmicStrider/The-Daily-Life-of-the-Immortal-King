  <h1>Chapter 1310 Groundhog-like confusion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Why is the gray mist creature a marmot...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the expression on Heavenly Dao's face is wonderful.</p>

    <p>After all, the creatures of gray fog have always been mysterious and unpredictable existences in the minds of Heavenly Dao. Power Heavenly Dao even calls them the mysterious power hidden under the gray fog.</p>

    <p>The pair of claws that are said to be indestructible make the Heavenly DaoGolden Men in heaven fearful.</p>

    <p>Take Heavenly Dao as an example. He has fantasized about the appearance of gray fog creatures countless times...</p>

    <p>That's Dao Ancestor Wang's mythical beast!</p>

    <p>How can I say that this complete form must at least have a volume the size of a planet!</p>

    <p>Every move and every move is filled with terrifying power that can destroy the planet. He stands on a nine-dragon coffin, wears star clothes, and his hands are like prehistoric blades. He can destroy everything in the world...</p>

    <p>But now, this persona has completely collapsed.</p>

    <p>Groundhog...</p>

    <p>Why is the mysterious gray fog creature such a creature that looks retarded and likes to scream "ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Heavenly Dao, who knew the truth of the matter, had the urge to overturn the table.</p>

    <p>(╯°Д°)╯︵┻━┻</p>

    <p>However, considering that this was at the home of Wang Ling. Survival Heavenly Dao still restrained his thoughts of seeking death.</p>

    <p>Because this table has also been enlightened, he can't offend it at all. And the Wang family's enlightened spirits are very united. If you lift the table at will, you will probably be hung up and beaten.</p>

    <p>He doesn't want to be transported to Lord Ma's inner space by Lord Ma to eat shit with Yu Shenshu...</p>

    <p>"Mythical beasts are all born from chaos. But why is it a marmot?" Survival Heavenly Dao was confused. He felt that he knew a huge secret. His whole body felt bad.</p>

    <p>"The reason is very simple. He may not be a groundhog at all. He is just a mythical beast that looks very similar to a groundhog. Such a probability is not impossible."</p>

    <p>At this time, the book of Sage Immortal once again talked to itself and interrupted: "The mythical beasts bred in the chaos are all kinds of strange. Many people think that the bigger they are, the more powerful they are. In fact, this is not the case."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean? Make it clearer." Er Ha also asked.</p>

    <p>"According to information calculated from big data, the strength of a mythical beast is determined based on the chaos energy in the body. The greater the proportion of chaos energy, the stronger it is. Therefore, many people pursue huge mythical beasts. They think that the larger the size, the more likely it is that the energy in the body will be stronger. The greater the proportion of chaos energy."</p>

    <p>The book of Sage Immortal said: "In fact, the size theory is completely a misunderstanding. The smaller the mythical beast bred from the chaos egg, the more valuable it is and the more powerful it is. Therefore, this gray mist creature that looks like a marmot is actually a misunderstanding. It's a very rare groundhog-like mythical beast."</p>

    <p>"No matryoshka dolls!"</p>

    <p>The corner of Er Ha's eye twitched: "Anyway, it looks like a groundhog. I think I'll just call it a groundhog."</p>

    <p>"I really didn't expect it to be like this." Heavenly Dao was amazed. He felt that his knowledge had increased.</p>

    <p>Here he got the answer to the true appearance of the creatures in the gray fog.</p>

    <p>It also means that other Heavenly Dao also know about it.</p>

    <p>All information between Heavenly Dao is exchanged. There are no secrets.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I still don't understand something. Since you three thousand Heavenly Dao have already been troubled by this prairie dog, why don't you fit in? Wouldn't it be enough to deal with it early?" At this time, Er Ha asked. And In fact, this is also a question that Wang Ling wants to ask.</p>

    <p>Talking about the "Heavenly Dao Fusion" thing. Even Heavenly Dao couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Surviving Heavenly Dao: "Back then, Dao Ancestor Wang divided us into 3,000 parts. He limited our power and also imposed a ban on merging. Although we can fuse, there is an upper limit on the number... We can only complete a maximum of one hundred Heavenly Dao fusions."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "One hundred Heavenly Dao combined. What level?"</p>

    <p>Survival Heavenly Dao: "Being slapped by Ling Zhenren will not lead to death."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Survival Heavenly Dao: "Three thousand Heavenly Dao merged. Such a thing has not happened for a long time. It is a fantasy to us. And this restriction is very strange. Even Ling Zhenren can't do it so easily. Lifted."</p>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>His King's Eyes can theoretically break all restrictions, curses, unclean things, etc.</p>

    <p>However, in the case of surviving Heavenly Dao. Wang Ling has not found any restrictions yet.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling feels that it is not that he cannot solve it. It is that he has not yet examined the "question" left by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>If you want to lift the ban, it's actually like doing a math problem. You need to understand the problem type and take the right medicine.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it is even more necessary to backtrack the entire calculation process.</p>

    <p>So as long as we find the specific way in which Dao Ancestor Wang set the ban, it will be easy to work backwards.</p>

    <p>Those complicated restrictions can't be accomplished simply by chanting a mantra and walking in a formation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that Dao Ancestor Wang is a "restriction maniac." He likes to perform operations that lock other people's permissions.</p>

    <p>For example, the "restriction" on entering the unspeakable place. It was also another question left by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>"How does Ling Zhenren plan to attack this gray mist creature?" asked the survivor Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>This question is actually very obscure.</p>

    <p>Out of his understanding of Wang Ling. Survival Heavenly Dao now also has a little understanding of Wang Ling's style. He is not the one who will take the first shot.</p>

    <p>And this is indeed the case.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling agreed to the Bronze Cat's commission and planned to take action against the gray mist creatures, now, he still needs a condition to take action.</p>

    <p>"The opportunity will come soon." At this time, Wang Ling said to Heavenly Dao. in a faint message.</p>

    <p>He had a premonition.</p>

    <p>I have a feeling that this groundhog will soon go to heaven to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>And it turned out that Wang Ling's hunch was accurate.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In heaven, with the arrival of an uninvited guest, all the little Golden Men of Heavenly Dao fell into panic.</p>

    <p>Gray mist creatures appeared in the meeting hall of the Heavenly Dao Committee.</p>

    <p>He put his claws against the neck of Heavenly Dao. His words were full of undoubted threats: "If you don't modify the white list, I will kill you."</p>

    <p>The gray mist creatures came to the heaven to cause trouble just as Wang Ling thought.</p>

    <p>He threatened Heavenly Dao with death. He asked Heavenly Dao to add the names of the three heads of the Wu, Li, and Sheng families to the whitelist of users.</p>

    <p>Regarding this request, the remaining Lords Heavenly Dao in Heaven felt deeply helpless.</p>

    <p>Power Heavenly Dao sweated on his forehead: "You should know. We do not have the right to decide the whitelist... All whitelist users are automatically entered after being filtered according to Dao Ancestor's conditions..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care. Anyway, you have to find a way." The gray mist creature continued to threaten with its claws.</p>

    <p>"Then just kill me." The strength of Heavenly Dao resisted.</p>

    <p>"???" The creatures in the gray mist were a little confused now. They don't know why.</p>

    <p>He felt that something was wrong with Heavenly Dao today. He was not as afraid of himself as he was when he came here in the past.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you want to talk to me so forcefully?" The gray mist creature sneered.</p>

    <p>As a result, Heavenly Dao stared at him with neither humility nor condescension: "Give up! You stupid groundhog!"</p>

    <p>"What did you call me???"</p>

    <p>The creatures in the gray mist were shocked.</p>

    <p>He has been hiding in the gray fog for so long!</p>

    <p>Why would anyone know what he looks like!</p>

    <p>Ahhhh!</p>

    <p>--What the hell is going on!</p>

    <p>The creatures in the gray mist roared in their hearts.</p>
