  <h1>Chapter 2151 Director Wang's performance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Thinking of the majesty of the guilds than the Four Elephants. The inventor and creator of various schools of the immortal sword profession. In terms of various paper data. Whether it is in terms of professional advantages, equipment quality, and equipment special effects. Sun Rong is all It cannot be said to have an absolute advantage.</p>

    <p>Fighting against level differences has always been regarded as taboo in the game world of Itinerant Immortal. This is an impossible act. What's more, Sun Rong is far inferior to Xiongwu in all aspects. It is even more unacceptable. Many players are optimistic about it.</p>

    <p>But a "miracle" happened. Sun Rong's defense was as strong as an indestructible mountain. It neutralized all sword attacks.</p>

    <p>Even Xiongwu felt emo after Xiongwu's two swords were down. He was a man who could kill even Hei Long... the thick-skinned Hei Long in Hei Long's cave. He was holding a big sword. He couldn't do anything with two swords. The skin and flesh are torn apart.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to the deputy general in front of him, his whole brain is buzzing. He feels that the guy he is facing cannot be judged by the psychology of a normal player.</p>

    <p>After eliminating all possibilities, the only possibility left is... the player in front of me may have mastered a "divine skill!"</p>

    <p>Although this is just a guess. But if it is true...</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Xiongwu was jealous.</p>

    <p>Isn't this what he has always dreamed of?</p>

    <p>After traveling around the world of Itinerant Immortal for so many years, he relied on the experience he accumulated little by little to achieve one remarkable achievement after another.</p>

    <p>Use your best field in the real world to analyze professions. Then create various schools. Then use the influence of the schools to win over people's hearts, establish a guild, and lead the group to download dungeons to obtain pieces of equipment.</p>

    <p>Let all those who follow him have the illusion that this copy will never survive without him.</p>

    <p>With the acquisition of pieces of orange equipment, and the growing number of guilds, the Four Elephants, a guild composed of professional sword immortal players, has become famous in the game world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>It can be said that Xiong Wu achieved everything he wanted in the game world.</p>

    <p>Stronger equipment, more powerful summoned spiritual beasts, and more gorgeous mounts. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>But now, the only thing he is missing is the legendary divine skill.</p>

    <p>This is currently recognized as the most difficult item to obtain in the world of Itinerant Immortal spell rings.</p>

    <p>The skills of professional factions are relatively fixed. The strongest skills are only of purple quality. Orange-quality magic skills can only be obtained from hidden tasks with a very small probability.</p>

    <p>The thing he had been chasing for so long... ended up being acquired by a new player in the Novice Village...</p>

    <p>This made Xiong Wu jealous.</p>

    <p>The confrontation between foreign parties. Wang Ling is watching it.</p>

    <p>He could also feel the deep jealousy rising in Xiong Wu's heart.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to obtain divine skills. From the perspective of Wang Ling, this is a normal phenomenon. After all, when Bai Qiao designed the game Itinerant Immortal, all the programming logic inside the game was based on the real world of cultivation. Designed in a frame.</p>

    <p>What is the concept of divine skills?</p>

    <p>Directly corresponds to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>It is not easy for a normal monk to comprehend a Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Even some monks who have been practicing for thousands of years can only get a glimpse of the outline of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if you want to understand the divine skills, even in the game world, Bai Qiao has modified the probability to a certain extent, but it is still difficult to reach the sky.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling, Sun Rong are different.</p>

    <p>Because they themselves know Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong doesn't understand. But now Sun Rong has the passive ability to merge with Aohai's human sword. Aohai understands!</p>

    <p>"Impossible! You must be cheating! I'm going to report you!" On the mount, Xiong Wu was very direct. He held a big sword and pointed it at Sun Rong. He stared at Sun Rong's avatar crazily and wanted to click [ Report] button.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the system also received a prompt that [your report has been submitted as feedback].</p>

    <p>However, this is of no use.</p>

    <p>Because in the outside world, Wang Ming is in charge of everything. He is the operator of the entire backstage. He didn't even read Xiongwu's report letter to Sun Rong, so he dismissed it directly.</p>

    <p>It didn't even enter the deliberation stage. It just disappeared...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Xiongwu's fight against the epidemic also aroused discussions among many players at the scene. They had never seen Xiongwu lose his composure like this before.</p>

    <p>"Why do you say someone is cheating? What evidence do you have?"</p>

    <p>"It's just her! The game is not even 48 hours long. She can actually have divine skills on her body! This is simply impossible!"</p>

    <p>"You can't get it yourself. It doesn't mean that others can't get it. It's just a matter of probability! And this deputy general is obviously not a new player. Otherwise, how could the level rise so fast? Maybe the other party would have known about it a long time ago. There is a way to obtain skills through hidden tasks!" A player below who supported Sun Rong retorted online.</p>

    <p>"You are really a nest of snakes and rats... I think your town in Fuyun is rotten to the roots!"</p>

    <p>Xiongwu became angry and yelled.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Bai and Mangshan also dismounted their mounts. After all, they were worried that Xiong Wu would take action against these players who told the truth.</p>

    <p>But Xiongwu still refused to admit defeat. He gritted his teeth and glared at Sun Rong: "You lieutenant general! Are you cheating! Why are you running Fuyun Town as an agent! You don't have a business license! Do you belong!" Illegal business!"</p>

    <p>When Mangshan heard this, he couldn't bear it anymore. He stepped forward directly, then stepped on the ground in front of him: "Retreat! --Retreat! --Retreat!"</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu couldn't help hearing this. His sword was ignited with blazing fire again. His body size increased dramatically, and he used his strongest technique.</p>

    <p>The body size difference is several times that of Sun Rong. The majestic figure at this moment is like a giant bear. He transformed into a giant. The body that covers the sky and the sun is covered with shadows. Like black clouds pressing over the city, the person in front of him is covered. All the players were covered.</p>

    <p>But even so. He still won't be Sun Rong's opponent.</p>

    <p>In the general's mansion, Wang Ling watched all this. He knew that he was no match for her.</p>

    <p>She also knew that he was no match for her. Even if she stepped on him, Xiong Wu would even be directly injured by Sun Rong's high-intensity defense.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not want Xiong Wu to step on it.</p>

    <p>So the critical moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took action.</p>

    <p>His figure was like a ghost. In an instant, he was in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>No one thought that the general of Fuyun Town would appear in public at this time.</p>

    <p>No one expected that this general from Fuyun Town... was only level 1...</p>

    <p>Level 1?</p>

    <p>Isn't this just a matter of seeking death?</p>

    <p>Xiongwu is a level 65 sword immortal professional player!</p>

    <p>A few players who are beyond the current world level!</p>

    <p>However, looking at the blood volume, everyone here couldn't hold back.</p>

    <p>Because this level 1 player...</p>

    <p>There are one hundred million (10000/10000) drops of blood!</p>

    <p>7017k</p>
