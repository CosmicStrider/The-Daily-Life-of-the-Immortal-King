  <h1>Chapter 2177 The Glazed Dragon God Sweeps the Heavens</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A glazed dragon god that has never been seen before in the history of the dragon clan. The dragon-headed man holds a seven-color long sword in his hand. His whole body is surrounded by powerful lotus and the aura of the eternal dragon.</p>

    <p>This kind of momentum is too powerful. It is almost comparable to the three leaders of the Dragon Clan in the ages. However, the most frightening thing is that Qiao Yanyuan has never seen such a glazed dragon and snake.</p>

    <p>The powerful dragon descendant is the heir to the genetic tradition of the dragon clan. Naturally, he is also familiar with the history of the dragon clan. But the appearance of the Glazed Dragon God is a gap in his memory. Qiao Yanyuan, who thought he could successfully control everything, felt a strange sense of panic.</p>

    <p>On the ferry in the restricted sea area, a drop of cold sweat fell from Qiao Yanyuan's forehead and spread to his feet.</p>

    <p>His body was also paying close attention to the battle for Wang Muyu. When he saw this glazed dragon god that did not belong to his memory, an unexpected uneasiness immediately surged into his heart.</p>

    <p>What is this Glazed Dragon God?</p>

    <p>Full of questions suddenly came to my mind.</p>

    <p>Soon, a tremor from the soul came one after another!</p>

    <p>It's the clone that is carrying out the task of competing for Wang Muyu in the distance. It has suffered trauma!</p>

    <p>The glazed dragon god holding a long sword carries an astonishing domineering aura. The eyes of the dragon god release seven colors of splendor. The gaze is like a torch. The body moves in an instant, dragging a hazy seven-color immortal energy.</p>

    <p>The first blow came almost instantly!</p>

    <p>"So fast!"</p>

    <p>The cloned body Qiao Yanyuan opened his arms to block it. He slashed it with one knife. The thick eternal dragon energy immediately dispersed.</p>

    <p>"Kacha!"</p>

    <p>The long knife fell. The seven-color divine thunder fell from the void almost at the same time. It was extremely terrifying. It carried an aura of annihilation of the Dao. It distorted the space of the core world.</p>

    <p>His body reacted very quickly. Although he immediately created a spiritual shield and stretched out his hand to block it, he still couldn't help but feel shaken when he saw such an astonishing aura falling down like a god.</p>

    <p>He thought that he had absorbed the power of many parallel dimensions and was fearless. But at this moment, he was still a little panicked. The spiritual light all over his body suddenly burst out, turning into pieces of dragon scales in his monster crystal body. It is plated with a layer of armor stomach.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu held the horn in his hand. He was floating slightly in the air. His eyes were almost in sync with the Glazed Dragon God. It was as if he was driving this powerful mecha to fight Qiao Yanyuan's clone. There was a connection between the two. There was no delay. There was a tacit understanding. Just like a person.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The knife hit Qiao Yanyuan's arm firmly, peeling off the armor and crystal dragon scales on his arm. The pain made his body gasp.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. This is the real clone.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu saw this scene from a distance and was convinced of the nature of the body in front of him.</p>

    <p>The real clone. It fully possesses part of the combat power of the original body. And it will not disappear at will due to pain and severe injuries. The powerful real clone even has its own will.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that a spatial bond is formed between the main body and the real clone. If necessary, you can even change hands directly and let the main body come on stage.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>This is a tough battle.</p>

    <p>He knows very well that Qiao Yanyuan is here to stare at him... Bai Zhe is not a man of martial ethics. Therefore, it is not ruled out that Qi first consumes himself with his real clone to test his true and false. The possibility of fighting him directly.</p>

    <p>The sword of the Glazed Dragon God was impressive, but its power was far beyond the body's imagination. After the sword fell, strange ancient lines began to appear on the slender sword.</p>

    <p>This is an inscription that strengthens the magic weapon. It cannot be deciphered by non-modern cultivation civilization. It is extremely rare even in the eons.</p>

    <p>The clone's body suddenly felt like it was facing a powerful enemy. It felt strange.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>His crystal body erupted with light. He used his own cultivation to put up the ultimate resistance. He wanted to stop the Glazed Dragon God's next slash!</p>

    <p>The power of the head-first blow can already be felt in the body. The charged blow of this knife will be obviously more terrifying.</p>

    <p>This glazed dragon god is not in the history of the dragon clan.</p>

    <p>It belongs to the blind spot of knowledge of Qiao Yanyuan's body. It is precisely because he knows nothing about this glazed dragon god. Therefore, Qiao Yanyuan and his clone feel that there is no way to start. The inscription on the seven-color long sword shines, rendering the long sword into Horrible myths and legends. Just looking at it gives you a sense of horror. The spiritual energy flowing out from above is like a bright galaxy pouring down. It is extremely overbearing.</p>

    <p>"That's weird! What the hell is this!"</p>

    <p>His body became anxious. He shrunk to the ground. His figure quickly shrank back. His intuition told him that this blow could not be received forcefully. He had to find a way to avoid it.</p>

    <p>However, the power of the Glazed Dragon God was once again beyond his imagination. He saw that the Dragon God's fingers were stained with a little sword energy. The sword fingers moved together into the void. The clone that had escaped once again appeared at a very close distance in front of the Glazed Dragon God.</p>

    <p>"He actually used his sword energy to directly chop up the space in front of him to shorten the distance..."</p>

    <p>With a simple move, he directly cracked the method of shrinking the ground into an inch. This was something that everyone present could hardly expect.</p>

    <p>The most gorgeous attacks often don't require so many movements. The most violent blows are often more unpretentious. The posture of the Glazed Dragon God is extremely chic. Everything is kept to the simplest. Every breath, attack, and sword slash are all revealed. The power of the dragon god that emerges from the great path to simplicity.</p>

    <p>"What a hassle..."</p>

    <p>The avatar frowned. He thought that this battle was won safely. But he didn't expect that Wang Muyu's real dragon-born magic weapon would be so difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the carriage that Itinerant Immortal is riding in the world. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong closed their eyes. Wang Muyu's battle scene was also synchronized to Wang Ling's spiritual will. Then Wang Ling synchronized it to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Although the two of them were in the game world, they still did not forget to care about the situation in the outside world.</p>

    <p>"What is this magic weapon of Xiao Muyu? The summoned glazed dragon god. It's so powerful." Sun Rong was amazed. Such a duel was not something that she, a monk who had just entered the Golden Core, could participate in at close range. No. With a strong shield, the spiritual pressure alone can crush her into a meat pie.</p>

    <p>"This does not count. A summoning magic weapon." Wang Ling explained using the sound transmission technique.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, Qiao Yanyuan and his body were mistakenly separated.</p>

    <p>It seemed that Wang Muyu blew the horn to summon the glazed dragon god to appear. But in fact, the real purpose of the glazed horn was not for summoning.</p>

    <p>"It's not a summoning magic weapon? But it's obvious..." Sun Rong sighed slightly. She knew that this was knowledge beyond her comprehension.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's expression was always calm. He crossed his arms and looked at everything. As if he was sure of winning the battle: "Besides, this is not Muyu's natal dragon-born magic weapon."</p>

    <p>"In other words, Muyu's natal dragon-born magic weapon is actually not this?" Sun Rong was surprised: "Then where did this magic weapon come from?"</p>

    <p>"To confuse them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said: "I prepared one for him in advance."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>
