  <h1>Chapter 1610 The "evolved" cultivator</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The phenomenon of the Earth monks turning into animals happened very suddenly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat at home for a long time. Let Ah Nuan investigate similar incidents across the globe.</p>

    <p>Use the power of Shadow to trace the shadow of everyone on the earth. You can easily know the whole situation.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling doesn't need to make any big movements. Just gently touch Ah Nuan girl's little head with your hand to get the information simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Unexpected results emerged.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Nuan saw it. All cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage suffered.</p>

    <p>Moreover. Everyone is "animalized" to a different degree.</p>

    <p>Some have transformed into a whole animal or even a spirit beast.</p>

    <p>And some, like yesterday's Wang Ling, just carry some parts of animals or spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>As for the enlightened spirits in Wang's villa and Er Ha's inability to self-recover after humanoid transformation, this is a bit like an abnormal feedback before a major earthquake.</p>

    <p>Could it be a sign that the people affected later will spread to higher realms...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little confused.</p>

    <p>The people around him can even use their magic power to repair and restore themselves. But if they are cultivators who have radiated radiation to the whole earth, this matter is actually risky.</p>

    <p>Even if there is only one in a billion chances of being traced back to the source of mana, Wang Ling is not willing to take this risk.</p>

    <p>After using magic power. Wang Ling restored Father Wang, Mother Wang, Er Ha and the humanoid spirits in the family to their original appearance. The expression on Father Wang's face looked particularly regretful.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, this is your fault! It's not easy for your father to code... It's hard to have two maids..." After saying this, Father Wang let out a painful scream.</p>

    <p>The reason was that Mother Wang pinched his thigh hard. The pinch was still the tenderest piece of meat on the inside. The pain caused Father Wang to kneel on the spot.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang turned on the TV and found that the incident was also reported on the TV.</p>

    <p>The female anchor of the morning news also suffered from "animalization."</p>

    <p>Her skin turned into leopard print...</p>

    <p>"We are now reporting a breaking news. Currently, monks below the Nascent Soul stage around the world are suddenly showing the characteristics of animals or spiritual beasts. This has become an [animalization event]. Relevant experts said that this event may be a step forward for human cultivators on earth. The future. A great turning point towards upgrading..."</p>

    <p>The overall fermentation of the incident was extremely fast.</p>

    <p>Because things are weird, I can only judge from experience.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that there are several possibilities as follows.</p>

    <p>One is that Wang Ming's zoochemical reagent was leaked. Because it is inhalable, it floats in the air... it can easily cause accidental injuries after being inhaled.</p>

    <p>But the weird thing now is that even if this inhaled animal-chemical reagent is leaked, it won't be able to travel that far!</p>

    <p>Globally...</p>

    <p>How could the few small jars of experimental products in Wang Ming's laboratory radiate to such a large area?</p>

    <p>There are still several possibilities left. Wang Ling feels that this may be someone with ulterior motives. And at least it must be a powerful person above the True Immortal level who has launched a taboo magic circle targeting the world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling made a call to Wang Ming. And he specially used a video call... mainly because he wanted to see what kind of animal Wang Ming had become.</p>

    <p>What I didn't expect was that when Wang Ming agreed to call, the scene in front of him looked normal.</p>

    <p>He wore a special thick protective suit to block radiation while studying the black stone.</p>

    <p>The protective clothing is specially modified by Wang Ling. It is extremely safe.</p>

    <p>"It should be related to the black stone." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>The mysterious black stone in the laboratory has the effect of shielding psychic energy.</p>

    <p>If a powerful person had deployed a large area of the magic circle, the power of the magic circle would not be able to cover the laboratory. And Wang Ming also successfully escaped the disaster of animal transformation.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling. A sly smile appeared under the closed glass helmet: "Why did you think of having a video call with me today? You still want to see what kind of animal I have become?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he turned the screen to the computer screen in his laboratory.</p>

    <p>The picture on the screen is exactly the picture of Wang Ling growing those bunny ears yesterday.</p>

    <p>During class, the scene of him lying on the desk with his eyes closed and concentrating was actually photographed!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Do you know how much I spent to buy this photo? And it also took me a lot of effort to restore the mosaic on it with technical means."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>In yesterday's game, it seemed that Wang Ming had achieved a comprehensive victory.</p>

    <p>But it's just a photo. And it's a photo without a full face. Wang Ling thought it was okay to take it...</p>

    <p>After all, the man in front of him is still working hard to develop a new Talisman for him. It doesn't matter if he gives him a benefit occasionally.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Wang Ling is more curious.</p>

    <p>How much did Wang Ming spend on buying this photo yesterday...</p>

    <p>And who sold it to him.</p>

    <p>In short, now, a matter of animalization reagents and a matter of buying photos. Wang Ling have all been recorded in the notebook.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, keep a small notebook as a habit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly realized that he seemed to have learned from Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After interrupting the call, the general context of the animalization incident Wang Ling has been sorted out.</p>

    <p>If the reagents in Wang Ming's laboratory weren't leaked, then someone else was behind it.</p>

    <p>After breakfast, Wang Ling was ready to go out. Mother Wang suddenly stopped Wang Ling: "Ling Ling! You can't go out like this!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Now all cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage have turned into animals. Most of the classmates in your class will also be like this. If you were normal now, wouldn't it be weird?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>I have to say. What Mother Wang said does make sense.</p>

    <p>Um.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Wang Ling had no choice but to raise his hand and change the bunny ears from yesterday.</p>

    <p>But this time the rabbit ears were not created using reagents.</p>

    <p>Rather, it is a "real illusion." It is something constructed using the illusion of King's Eyes. It is the same as yesterday's rabbit ears. It has touch, temperature, and can be touched.</p>

    <p>After the bunny ears grew out, Mother Wang couldn't help but take several photos in a row. She also shouted: "Ahhh! My son is so cute! By the way, do you still want a younger brother?" It would be nice to have a litter of rabbits!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Father Wang and Wang Ling both took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>Both father and son felt a maternal brilliance from Mother Wang...</p>

    <p>After a while, Mother Wang smiled with a red face, "You're kidding! It's better to raise Ah Nuan first."</p>

    <p>Give birth to a litter...</p>

    <p>At this time, Father Wang breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The son with bunny ears is cute though.</p>

    <p>But it's a bit too outrageous to give birth to a litter... Who knows if it's a son or a nuclear bomb!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This day. When Wang Ling came to class.</p>

    <p>Many people in the class have taken leave.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao didn't come either.</p>

    <p>According to Chen Chao, it is said that Er Dan, his parrot that turned into human form, was tied up in his house...</p>

    <p>"Now. It's probably over."</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao put on the posture of "having a cigarette afterward" and sighed towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
