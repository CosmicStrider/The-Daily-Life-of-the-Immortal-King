  <h1>Chapter 1807 Unimagined Road 3</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Surrendering to the enemy midway. For Levis, this was definitely an unimagined path. He didn't know whether he was right to do so. But he made a practical analysis based on the current situation.</p>

    <p>In the situation where Maiko Assi, Lawen and the church that wanted to separate him from the beginning cannot be trusted, cooperation with Huaguo Shuilian Group, Office of Strategic Deception and others seems to be the only correct path.</p>

    <p>As for blaming Number 60 High School, Levi felt that he did not have the ability to cover everything so far. Moreover, he also did not have the ability to put the dead Arch Pope back into the state of "suspended death."</p>

    <p>If you do that, the Office of Strategic Deception is full of experts. They will definitely be able to find out the clues.</p>

    <p>And speaking more seriously, he put the blame for the Arch Pope's incident on Number 60 High School. At that time, it may directly trigger a war between the two cultivating countries... This is also one of the paths that Levi has never imagined.</p>

    <p>Although he had previously used the truck driver to frame the death of his subordinate Meili on the head of the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. But in the end, it was just a trivial matter.</p>

    <p>When one Merry falls, thousands of Merry will get up again. But the Arch Pope is still different. This is the backbone of Mixiu Country's faith in this huge country of cultivation. Once it collapses, the consequences are really hard to predict.</p>

    <p>In short, causing a war. This is not a situation Levi's wants to see. His original intention was just to suppress the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception and restrict their development. But he did not really want to kill the opponent with one blow.</p>

    <p>Because from a businessman's perspective, money still has to be made.</p>

    <p>With material conditions, the body is always more honest than the mouth.</p>

    <p>Once a war breaks out, the people between the two major cultivation countries will always suffer. Without a stable living environment, how can they make money steadily?</p>

    <p>Quickly packing the body of the Arch Pope. Levis used a huge refrigerator to put the body of the Arch Pope in it. Then he used storage bags to store the refrigerator in his own space.</p>

    <p>By the time all this was done, it was already early in the morning.</p>

    <p>Now he can only talk to Sun Rong. So he must go to the hotel where Number 60 High School is located. And he must go there at night.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, moving a corpse walking on the road would be too conspicuous.</p>

    <p>Levis was sitting in the car. He had just driven the car out of his villa. Through the rearview mirror, he saw someone behind him chasing him at an extremely high speed!</p>

    <p>"Who sent this?" Levis became nervous instantly.</p>

    <p>Very strong murderous aura!</p>

    <p>It spread directly to the back of his neck! It gave him a chilly feeling!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, he stepped on the accelerator and increased the horsepower to the maximum. At the same time, he pressed the flying wing button on the car and rushed directly into the air!</p>

    <p>The man who was chasing him refused to let him go. He immediately followed him with his spiritual sword drawn out.</p>

    <p>It was only then that Levi discovered that there was more than one person chasing him!</p>

    <p>The men in black chasing him from all directions formed a kind of encirclement. It seemed that they had been premeditated.</p>

    <p>What on earth do these people want to do?</p>

    <p>Could it be that he has already discovered that he killed the Arch Pope?</p>

    <p>But this is too much of a coincidence.</p>

    <p>How could he just kill the Arch Pope and be targeted by a group of people?</p>

    <p>In the extremely fast escape of life and death, Levi's brain was running at the same time. The only possibility he thought of was that this might really be a game!</p>

    <p>A game that wanted to kill him...</p>

    <p>"Damn it!" He controlled the steering wheel and performed various extreme operations in the air.</p>

    <p>Behind him, dozens of men in black stepped on spiritual swords. They transformed into meteors and followed him.</p>

    <p>This speed is as fast as the speed of his car. It's so exaggerated!</p>

    <p>At this time, Levi felt like he was being targeted by a pack of wolves. Moreover, they were a pack of hungry wolves who had been hungry for several days. They charged forward desperately, with a strong attitude that they would never give up until they caught him.</p>

    <p>Levi gritted his teeth. When the vehicle drove to the Immortal Lake in Glio City, he plunged directly into the lake.</p>

    <p>Under water, no matter how powerful you are, your movements will be subject to certain restrictions.</p>

    <p>But what shocked Levi was...</p>

    <p>Just under the bottom of the Immortal Lake. Someone is already waiting for him!</p>

    <p>Just like the men in black who were chasing him behind him, when they saw Levis entering the bottom of the lake, they waved their spiritual swords directly. The golden light blade flashed across the bottom of the lake in an instant, forming a dividing force and surrounding his car from all sides. Instantly split into pieces!</p>

    <p>Then, under the lake, a big explosion occurred in Levi's car. This was caused by the energy igniting the spiritual stone in the car. A huge column of water shot up on the lake.</p>

    <p>Levis was blown up until he was covered in blood. He used all his strength to escape from the lake and climbed to the shore in an extremely embarrassed manner.</p>

    <p>At this time, the men in black who had been chasing after him also immediately surrounded him.</p>

    <p>Only then did Levis clearly see the slightly familiar markings on these men in black, as well as the black and red spiritual swords that these men were uniformly equipped with.</p>

    <p>In almost every city in Mixiu Country, there is a group of dark-wing law enforcers who only live at night. They maintain the stability of the city at night and effectively reduce the probability of crime at night.</p>

    <p>However, these Dark Wing law enforcers also belong to the Army Department and are under the jurisdiction of Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>Levis knew that there was such a group of people in Glio City, but it was the first time he actually saw the true form of this group of people.</p>

    <p>"You are... people from Maiko Assi..." Levis saw the origin of these men in black with blurred vision.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Levis. Because you are suspected of being involved in the disappearance of the Arch Pope, we are here to capture you on the orders of General Maiko Assi. We hope you will cooperate." A leader of men in black stood up.</p>

    <p>"so it is..."</p>

    <p>In an instant, Levi understood everything.</p>

    <p>The layout of it all. With Maiko Assi's transparent identity, it unfolds in his mind at a glance.</p>

    <p>He moved forward and tried his best to escape. However, the group of dark wings behind him did not give him any chance.</p>

    <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

    <p>Two gunshots were fired in succession. They were shot directly from the special black and red spirit sword, hitting his two calves.</p>

    <p>Levis knew he had no escape.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes and sighed in his heart. At the same time, he was also thinking about why he had fallen to this point.</p>

    <p>And at this moment.</p>

    <p>In the already dead air, he suddenly heard several falling sounds. Right next to him, several Dark Wings suddenly fell down and fell directly beside him.</p>

    <p>It was a young man with snow-white hair. He suddenly appeared here. He looked like a ghost. Like the incarnation of shadow.</p>

    <p>Under the bright moonlight, his white hair danced in the wind, giving off a faint luster. It was even more conspicuous at this moment.</p>

    <p>Levi's eyes were confused. Coupled with the serious injuries on his body, his mind was a little confused at this moment: "You are... Satoru Gojo..."</p>

    <p>Young man: "..."</p>

    <p>Satoru Gojo!</p>

    <p>He is Wang Ying!</p>
