  <h1>Chapter 1486 Wang Ming! Danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>That night, the blood sample analysis report of Wang Ling was released. Wang Ming stared at the "↑" arrows after each line of data on the sample. He couldn't help but frown.</p>

    <p>Such expressions are not uncommon. When middle-aged people with high blood pressure and fatty liver in the hospital get the report card, the expression on their face is almost exactly the same as Wang Ming's current expression.</p>

    <p>And this kind of "knitted brows" expression is actually more common in other different situations.</p>

    <p>For example, when parents get your report card;</p>

    <p>For example, when you see a certain author and eunuch;</p>

    <p>For example, when the teacher found out that you didn't do your homework and ran to watch {The Daily Life of the Immortal King};</p>

    <p>Another example. When you see the author of a book writing so many sentences starting with "such as", you may also be frowning and wondering if this short and short author is underestimating the number of words...</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>A blood test report under normal circumstances. When ordinary people get a blood sample analysis report, their first reaction is definitely to look at the arrows following the indicators.</p>

    <p>The normal range of cholesterol is 2.8-5.17mmolL. Test data: 6.17mmolL.</p>

    <p>Although it's a little too much. But there is still hope...</p>

    <p>However, for the blood sample of Wang Ling, if a "↑" arrow appears, it often means danger.</p>

    <p>"It's exactly what I thought. The energy concentration is on an upward trend. It's growing faster than before." Wang Ming carefully looked at the data in the analysis report. His face became a little ugly.</p>

    <p>The blood sample data of Wang Ling was originally analyzed to serve the purpose of creating the fourth generation mecha device.</p>

    <p>As a result, the indicators in Wang Ling's body were extremely high. This was far beyond Wang Ming's expectation.</p>

    <p>According to the initial data of sealing Talisman, sealing Talisman can basically help Wang Ling maintain its status for several years.</p>

    <p>This allows the data in Wang Ling's body, which Wang Ming calls "power concentration", to reach a balanced level.</p>

    <p>Although as Wang Ling continues to grow, the time Talisman suppresses is decreasing year by year.</p>

    <p>But because the sealed Talisman itself is constantly being upgraded. Wang Ming's estimate for the new generation of Talisman is that there should be no problems at least within 2 years.</p>

    <p>But now he realizes that he made a mistake.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's growth is faster than he imagined.</p>

    <p>The Talisman currently worn by Wang Ling was specially sent to Number 59 High School. He thought it could help Wang Ling pass through his high school years smoothly.</p>

    <p>But now I found that although this Talisman still looks new and has no signs of cracks at all.</p>

    <p>However, it seems a little reluctant to suppress the data concentration in Wang Ling's body to a balanced level.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is almost urgent to find new substances that can be used to suppress Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You said before that you discovered a mysterious black stone. In your sealed state, even the King's Eyes can't see through it, right?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming suddenly said: "If possible, I hope you can get this black stone as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming feels that the ancient black stone mentioned by Wang Ling before may be the key to everything.</p>

    <p>Of course. Developing a new Talisman is definitely not that simple.</p>

    <p>But the sooner this is done, the better.</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now?" At this time, Wang Ying finally couldn't help but make a sound.</p>

    <p>"Are you very concerned about my brother?"</p>

    <p>"He and I are one. If he can't restrain his energy and finally explodes, I will die too." Wang Ying replied.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ming has never seen Wang Ying. He just knows that such a thing exists.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was slightly surprised when he heard the shadow behind Wang Ling suddenly speak: "It's interesting. My brother is autistic. You are not. And he seems to be a chatterbox?"</p>

    <p>"Ha. The shadow and the main body have opposite personalities. Of course I will not be autistic." Wang Ying smiled and said: "Besides, I have already tasted the taste of girls."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ying licked his lips.</p>

    <p>He thought about the forced kiss he had with Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>To this day, I still feel like I haven't finished it yet. In the past few days, Wang Ying has actually been planning to find some excuse. Let's do it again.</p>

    <p>But Sun Ying'er didn't know what the wind was blowing these days. She seemed to be particularly quiet. She didn't deliberately say bad things about him. She didn't violate any "house rules."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying couldn't find any reason for "punishment" at all.</p>

    <p>It's really such a pity...</p>

    <p>"Does it smell like a girl?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also laughed: "So what you are saying is that my brother is a virgin who has never even tasted a girl?"</p>

    <p>"Isn't it?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was silent. Speechless.</p>

    <p>"But as far as I know, it seems like you are too, right?" Wang Ying suddenly said at this time.</p>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ming's mouth twitched. He found that in comparison, Wang Ling was indeed much cuter!</p>

    <p>This shadow is so damn owed! Isn't it nice to know something well? It's embarrassing to have to say it...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that there is nothing he can do against Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>But out of respect for an adult man, Wang Ming still said stiffly: "I'm not that anymore!"</p>

    <p>"Oh? Really?" Wang Ying smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming blushed slightly. She was still making up nonsense: "When I was my brother's age, I didn't have too many female companions. Some of them were already pregnant with my child. It is said that they would perform functions immediately after giving birth."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling actually saw between Wang Ming's eyebrows. There was a vague black aura from the Death Star.</p>

    <p>He knew roughly what happened.</p>

    <p>I'm hesitating whether to tell Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But sometimes this idiot guy just likes to talk and brag without drafting.</p>

    <p>Anyway, bragging is not taxable.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I get so excited that I can't stop talking.</p>

    <p>"You still don't believe me? I can tell you. I know all the postures. If you don't understand in the future, you can come and ask me for more advice. Since you are my brother's shadow, I think it's not too much to call me Brother Sheng, right?"</p>

    <p>"You're so embarrassed to say that." Wang Ying hehe.</p>

    <p>"What's so embarrassing about this? Your brother Ming has a lot of experience. Not only has he read countless films, but he also has a lot of practical experience. Do you know my {brain deduction technique}?"</p>

    <p>"Oh. You mean the ability to simulate countless situations in the brain and then sort the results from top to bottom according to probability to arrive at the optimal solution?"</p>

    <p>"nice."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded: "You said you kissed a girl once. But I am different. I have this ability. While kissing a girl, my brain simulates thousands of kissing methods. These are actually You can help me add experience."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked: "..."</p>

    <p>Isn't it time to discuss his "power concentration?"</p>

    <p>Why did the conversation change and suddenly start discussing such a strange topic!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Wang Ling found that he couldn't get a word in at all.</p>

    <p>First, he really has no experience. Second, he doesn't know how to brag. His life is really too humble...</p>

    <p>But at this moment. Wang Ling was at a loss.</p>

    <p>A familiar figure suddenly appeared at the door of Wang Ming's laboratory. Zhai Yin woke up from the sleeping cabin at some point.</p>

    <p>She happened to hear what Wang Ming said...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>Danger!</p>
