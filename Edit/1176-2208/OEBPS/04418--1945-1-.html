  <h1>Chapter 1945 The price of getting 1 point closer to Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Yingying never thought that in order to buy the beautiful desk behind Wang Ling, she "worked" so hard. She finally made money. She was about to see the light of day. But the position was suddenly taken by someone. Buy it!</p>

    <p>For a moment, Jiang Yingying's heart and hands were trembling.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it was early in the morning and there was no one else around. Jiang Yingying didn't need to pay too much attention to his appearance.</p>

    <p>She didn't care much anymore and immediately asked anxiously: "Guo Hao, you are always well-informed. Do you know who the person who bought the seat is?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. He is a new transfer student." Guo Hao crossed his arms and said with a mysterious face: "But I don't know who this person is yet. He is in Teacher Pan's office now. Teacher Pan is going through the handover procedures for him."</p>

    <p>"In the head teacher's office? Thank you! I'll go find him right away!" Jiang Yingying said excitedly. She ran away very fast, almost running wildly.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying's idea now is actually very simple. As long as this position is not bought by Sun Rong, then there is still room for negotiation.</p>

    <p>Since he is a new transfer student, it is even easier. She can even make a deal with this new student directly with the small pot of tea in her hand!</p>

    <p>Anyway, the other party has just arrived. She doesn't understand the situation in the class. And she is an old person who has been here for almost a month!</p>

    <p>Looking at Jiang Yingying's running back, Chen Chao sighed in his heart: "It turns out she hasn't given up yet. I thought she had given up chasing Wang Ling a long time ago. After all, Boss Sun is keeping a close eye on her. I don't know what's so good about this guy Wang Ling. Why do girls everywhere like him? How come I don't have this fate!"</p>

    <p>"Look at Jiang Yingying's attitude. He wants to negotiate with the new student..." Guo Hao said, touching his double chin.</p>

    <p>"Negotiation? Is she rich? I remember her family is not particularly wealthy. Could it be that she really won the lottery and became rich?" Chen Chao wondered.</p>

    <p>"Whether it can work or not depends on whether the new student is willing to sell it. Anyway, as far as I know, this beautiful desk doesn't seem to be bought by this new student."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao looked at Chen Chao seriously and said, "It's from Teacher Pan."</p>

    <p>"A gift?" Chen Chao asked suspiciously, "What's going on?"</p>

    <p>"Our school's comprehensive ranking has gone up now. The world ranking and national ranking have improved significantly. We can always attract some rich people to study in the school."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao said: "I heard from my uncle that the new classmate's family is rich. Originally, Lao Chen didn't even plan to accept transfer students. But this classmate said that as long as he is willing to let him study at Number 60 High School, he will. Our school is donating a new teaching building. By the way, it will be renovated during the summer vacation."</p>

    <p>"Good guy..." Chen Chao was stunned when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Donate the building directly and renovate the school...</p>

    <p>Indeed. With such a big deal, a set of beautiful desks and chairs is nothing.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling came to the classroom, he saw Jiang Yingying sitting at the desk with a gloomy look on his face. His face was full of immortal anger.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what happened to this girl. She looked like she had received a huge blow.</p>

    <p>In fact, as soon as I entered the gate of Number 60 High School today. Wang Ling already felt that the atmosphere in the school was very unusual.</p>

    <p>Not only that. When he sat down in his seat, Zhenyuan and Gu Shunzhi next to him were all staring at him with grins on their faces.</p>

    <p>This is obviously something...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling doesn't know what exactly will happen.</p>

    <p>He didn't bother to deduce it. Maybe it was some silly prank?</p>

    <p>However, this group of people are usually quite serious. They don't look like people who would make fun of themselves.</p>

    <p>As usual, Wang Ling took out all the homework at home. Folded each one and placed it on the corner of the table. Waiting for Su Xiao to come over and collect the homework.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a familiar voice came from the corridor in front of the class door.</p>

    <p>That was the echo of Teacher Pan's high heels stepping on the marble floor of the corridor. I don't know why. She came earlier than usual even though it was not yet time for morning self-study.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling almost immediately became alert.</p>

    <p>This familiar scene...</p>

    <p>Could it be that there is a new person coming to the class?</p>

    <p>A drop of cold sweat hung on his cheek.</p>

    <p>Then I saw Teacher Pan walking in from the door with a tall male student wearing transparent-rimmed glasses. This man had neat short hair and dark skin.</p>

    <p>But these facial features. Wang Ling are too familiar... plus the aura emanating from this body. Although the other party has suppressed it very well, Wang Ling can still tell who the person is right away.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan narrowed his eyes and laughed loudly: "Let me introduce to everyone. This new classmate is the newly transferred classmate Jia Jun!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling is really living in Bengbu.</p>

    <p>God Jiajun!</p>

    <p>It's obviously Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>Jia Jun = fake king?</p>

    <p>Deduct money for homophonic memes!</p>

    <p>He didn't know why even Lord Diulei transferred to Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>And he even used a new identity!</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that he also deliberately disguised his appearance. Not only did he cut his long hair into short hair, but his skin tone was eight degrees darker... He also wore a pair of transparent-rimmed eyes. It looked like Just like a sunshine sports student!</p>

    <p>I have to say, this disguise is really clever.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for being so familiar with Lord Diulei, even Wang Ling would be kept in the dark.</p>

    <p>At least most people here have not figured out the true identity of this classmate "Jia Jun."</p>

    <p>Because no one would have thought that a sect leader would come to high school to attend classes!</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling finally knows. Why did Gu Shunzhi stare at him and smile maliciously just now in Zhenyuan!</p>

    <p>I bet this was planned in advance!</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling still didn't know the purpose of Lord Diulei transferring here, fortunately, the people who transferred here were also acquaintances. Wang Ling was immediately relieved of his worries.</p>

    <p>He felt that he should have thought of this day long ago.</p>

    <p>The head of the Office of Strategic Deception of the world's most powerful super sect actually came to school and became his classmate. I'm afraid no one would believe it if I told him about it.</p>

    <p>"Hello everyone. I hope that in the days to come, I can get along well with you, make progress together, and become good friends. Please give me your advice." On the podium, Lord Diulei bowed to break Wang Ling's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Just sit behind the last classmate Wang Ling over there." Teacher Pan pointed in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered it. He really loves acting. He actually followed Teacher Pan's words and performed: "Classmate Wang Ling? Who is that classmate? Is that the pretty classmate by the window over there? ?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. It's the one with the pretty features and the dead fish eyes." Teacher Pan said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Okay teacher." Lord Diulei nodded. Then he walked behind Wang Ling with a pile of newly issued textbooks. He sat down naturally. There was an unstoppable smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Got it. This is not just a long-term plan. This is how much you look forward to being a classmate with him to laugh like this idiot...</p>
