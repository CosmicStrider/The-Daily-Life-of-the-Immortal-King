  <h1>Chapter 1758 Intelligence Obsessive-compulsive Disorder</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This operation of directly betraying his partner without saying a word. Tengu handled it too decisively and skillfully. It made Wang Ling feel like an old complaint in his heart and he didn't know where to start.</p>

    <p>People who do big things don't stick to trivial matters. It's not surprising that operations like cutting off the tail of a gecko can be demonstrated in the hands of Tengu.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that Martial Saint had clenched his fists at this moment. In fact, he could feel that Martial Saint was trying his best to restrain his emotions. From the moment he and Tengu came face to face. Martial Saint Jiang, he already had murderous intentions.</p>

    <p>However, considering the overall situation, he still chose to be patient and did not directly fight here.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, Tengu spoke. The voice was calm and composed, but at the same time it had a mysterious flavor, "Sir, since you and I are destined, I can give you a piece of information for free. Your granddaughter has been rescued." So you stay here. It doesn't make any sense."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, under the facial mask, Martial Saint Jiang could not help but frown.</p>

    <p>His coming here was a private act. It was impossible for outsiders to know...but the Tengu in front of him still saw through his identity. This made him feel that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>And that's for sure.</p>

    <p>Among the Huaxiu Alliance, Office of Strategic Deception. There must be a Tengu mole.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you afraid?" After thinking for a moment, Martial Saint Jiang spoke up, issuing a warning voice: "Tengu, you can't be arrogant for long."</p>

    <p>Tengu is fearless. He also smiled: "Whether we exist or not is not up to you."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Tengu had already made up his mind. Martial Saint Jiang would not choose to take action here.</p>

    <p>While he was looking weirdly at Martial Saint Jiang, he turned his attention to Wang Ling who was wearing a raccoon mask.</p>

    <p>A young monk wearing a white sportswear and a raccoon mask...and he was sent by the Office of Strategic Deception. He also followed Martial Saint Jiang...</p>

    <p>Tengu searched in his mind. Then he was shocked to find that he had no information about this young man.</p>

    <p>Even if I occasionally think of something, my mind is still a mosaic...</p>

    <p>"Weird. What the hell is going on?"</p>

    <p>He felt that even if he didn't know the specific identity of Wang Ling, he should at least be able to see what Wang Ling looked like under the face.</p>

    <p>In fact, from the moment Wang Ling and Martial Saint Jiang entered the door, he already knew that the person under the mask was Martial Saint Jiang.</p>

    <p>Because the behind-the-scenes senior who stands behind the Roaring Sky Alliance and all the Tengu has given them a way to easily distinguish the disguised appearance of the other party.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter whether it's a shape-shifting spell or wearing a mask that prevents pupil spells.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, this method had no effect on Wang Ling. He only saw clusters of mosaics.</p>

    <p>"Damn...I really want to know who he is." Tengu gritted his teeth secretly.</p>

    <p>After doing intelligence work for a long time, he felt as if he was suffering from a disease called intelligence obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, a young cultivator shouldn't have this kind of ability that can prevent him from peeking into his true appearance...</p>

    <p>This magic weapon in his hand can easily penetrate even Martial Saint Jiang's mask and see his true appearance.</p>

    <p>Not to mention a young man.</p>

    <p>"Sooner or later, I will catch you." At this time, Marshal Jiang stared at the tengu in front of him and said in a deep voice.</p>

    <p>Because Jiang Yingying's voice did come from his headset.</p>

    <p>That was Jiang Yingying calling through the Office of Strategic Deception communication device here at Sun Rong. The ultimate purpose of his trip was to ensure the safety of his granddaughter. This is the most important thing. He can do anything else for it. Consider the overall situation and choose to be patient.</p>

    <p>Although now. He really wants to take action and beat up the guy wearing the Jason mask in front of him.</p>

    <p>He left these words and was about to take Wang Ling away.</p>

    <p>As a result, Tengu suddenly grabbed his arm and said: "--Wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>Tengu: "I want to know who this young man standing next to you is."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang and Wang Ling turned their faces almost at the same time: "?"</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Martial Saint suddenly laughed: "Do you still have information that you don't know?" I have obsessive-compulsive disorder... As long as it is something I am involved in, I must know all the details."</p>

    <p>Tengu took Martial Saint Jiang's arm and said excitedly: "Otherwise I won't be able to sleep!"</p>

    <p>"What does that have to do with me?"</p>

    <p>"It has nothing to do with you. But..."</p>

    <p>Tengu was silent this day. Finally he gritted his teeth and said: "An information! You tell me who he is. I will tell you an information! Any information is fine! Take it as an exchange!"</p>

    <p>After saying this, Martial Saint Jiang and Wang Ling were dumbfounded at the same time.</p>

    <p>I feel like my horizons have really been opened this time.</p>

    <p>"Haha. You can still do this?" Martial Saint Jiang couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"Exchange of equal value is naturally possible." The Tengu said: "Besides, I am only the Duobao City branch dog among the Tengu. This is my decision. The other Tengu can't do anything. Of course, the information you mentioned will determine We cannot harm the core interests of our Roaring Heavenly Alliance. In addition to any information, we can provide you with..."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang heard this. He turned around and looked at Wang Ling beside him.</p>

    <p>Under the raccoon mask. At this time, Wang Ling couldn't help but shed a drop of cold sweat. But overall he was calm and composed.</p>

    <p>He was not frightened by the Tengu's words.</p>

    <p>Even prepared for the worst.</p>

    <p>That is, once his face is seen by these two people, he will directly erase their memories...</p>

    <p>But after Martial Saint Jiang glanced at him, he just patted him on the shoulder and laughed: "Young man, you are so young, but your determination is quite good."</p>

    <p>He wanted to scare Wang Ling. In the end, not only did he not scare Wang Ling, but he slapped Wang Ling on the shoulder, which made him freeze in place.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>What did he see?</p>

    <p>Although I just touched Wang Ling a little bit.</p>

    <p>But he confirmed the potential for cultivation hidden in Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>If his judgment was correct, he would be sure that Wang Ling possesses a level of cultivation that is rare in thousands of years!</p>

    <p>If he could be accepted as a disciple... the successor he had longed for, Miao Zi, to inherit his mantle of Martial Saint, would have new hope!</p>

    <p>Although he put a lot of effort into Jiang Yingying, Martial Saint Jiang could actually see that his granddaughter didn't like to imitate the things he did.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he had the idea of looking for a new heir very early.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that today, by such a coincidence, I would bump into Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Wang Ling, who is caught in the middle, seems particularly embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Because now it's not just Tengu. Even Marshal Jiang wants to know. Who is he...</p>

    <p>For the first time in my life, I was stared at by two men with such intense eyes. It made Wang Ling feel a little stiff all over...</p>

    <p>"So. Should we do this deal or not?" After a moment, Tengu finally couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"It probably can't be done." Martial Saint Jiang sighed together.</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Because I also want to know. Who is he."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
