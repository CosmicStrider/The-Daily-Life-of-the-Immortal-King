  <h1>Chapter 2179 Eternal Corpse Dragon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This eternal corpse dragon appeared strangely. Its spliced body was filled with a sense of disharmony like a puppet. But its movement speed was extremely fast, like light, shadow, thunder and lightning. The negative black energy surging all over the body suddenly appeared. The corpse dragon is the center. It spreads to the entire core world.</p>

    <p>That is a long-standing accumulation of cosmic-level negative emotions.</p>

    <p>"The Great Purification Technique!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu stretched out his little hand and pointed into the void. A holy ray burst out from the fingertips. This was one of the Heavenly Dao spells among the three thousand Heavenly Dao. Wang Muyu had been instructed by Wang Ling a long time ago. I learned it next time. Almost in seconds.</p>

    <p>The Great Purification Technique is most suitable for use in situations like this. It can eliminate inner demons from entering the body and sweep away all kinds of poisonous and violent energy in the world. This can calm the mind and achieve a stable state of mind.</p>

    <p>This holy great purification ray shot through the air, directly tearing apart the black air that shrouded the core world.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the spreading negative emotions seemed to be under control. But soon the torn sky and endless black air continued to shroud.</p>

    <p>"Even the Heavenly Dao spell can't completely purify it..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu frowned. He immediately knew in his heart that this was a power that was superior to the level of Heavenly Dao spells. In such a situation, unless the Heavenly Dao spells were practiced to the extreme and used in combination, they would be able to fight.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu learned quickly, his proficiency was far from being as good as Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"It would be nice if dad was here..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu looked at the black air that was constantly re-condensing in the sky. He couldn't help but muttered softly.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, you have to be careful. These black energies not only have negative emotions, but also have a kind of curse power." Yi Jianchuan reminded from the side. Although his realm was the lowest in the field, his state of mind was ridiculously powerful.</p>

    <p>This scene made Qiao Yanyuan's clone stunned. It was a holy realm. It was completely unaffected by the black energy...</p>

    <p>How is this done?</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>This is just a mere human being...</p>

    <p>Curse power?</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, my teacher's reminder suddenly played a decisive role.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu never thought that this black energy actually contained some kind of curse power. No wonder this negative black energy could not be completely eradicated even by the Great Purification Technique. It was so difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>"What a hassle!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu frowned. He clasped his hands together. The glazed dragon god radiated brilliance, illuminating the dark sky shrouded in black air. Countless colorful divine rings appeared, blessing him all over his body. There was an astonishing transcendence.</p>

    <p>The sword slashed into the void. A curtain of light immediately flowed down like a waterfall from the gap where the sword slashed horizontally. Like the aurora in the dark night, it enveloped Wang Muyu's body and Yi Jianchuan's body.</p>

    <p>At this moment, this negative black energy mixed with the power of the curse was blocked. The gas flowing out from the cracks slashed by the sword energy contained a powerful spiritual energy. It was blessed with various ancient patterns. There are many ways to prevent it. The power of invasion.</p>

    <p>The Glazed Dragon God is like the living Dragon God Supreme. It is powerful against the eternal chaos weapon.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The black coffin shook. More black energy leaked out from inside. At the same time, the corpse dragon made a harsh roar. It can be seen that with the black coffin as the center, everything around it became chaotic.</p>

    <p>"This chaos device can actually refine other people's core worlds?" Wang Muyu did not expect that this summoning type of chaos device has such an additional ability. It can absorb other people's core world energy and convert it into the auxiliary energy of the corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>He immediately realized that this battle must be fought quickly. If it was delayed any longer, it would inevitably reach a stalemate.</p>

    <p>Clang!</p>

    <p>The seven-color glazed sword burst out with dazzling light. At the same time, the figure of the glazed dragon god began to skyrocket. The seven-color magic rings on his body also began to expand under the accumulation of powerful spiritual energy. The body that was ten thousand feet tall was like Pangu standing tall on the sky and the earth.</p>

    <p>He waved his sword, guarding Wang Muyu and Yi Jianchuan behind him, and grabbed them into the void with his right hand.</p>

    <p>He pinched the black coffin and forced the coffin boards together to prevent the black air from flowing out and prevent the core world from being refined and swallowed up. This scene shocked Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>What's next to the black coffin is a black hole of chaos!</p>

    <p>Normally you can't get close!</p>

    <p>Everything that comes close will be devoured and refined by it... But after becoming twice as powerful, this glazed dragon god actually ignored this chaotic black hole.</p>

    <p>Could it be that its spiritual energy density is already higher than the black hole itself?</p>

    <p>At this moment, the whole body was shaken.</p>

    <p>This kind of physical strength is too amazing. He can be called an immortal dragon king.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A big explosion occurred in the void. Before the body could react, the black coffin was crushed on the spot by the Glazed Dragon God. It turned into a cloud of purple smoke in the palm of his hand and disappeared.</p>

    <p>The corpse dragon held its head and roared in pain. The pain of being cut off from the black coffin caused it to fall into a state of confusion for a short time. But the corpse dragon soon regained its composure.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu looked at this scene and became even more confused.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"That's not right Wang Ling. Normally speaking, since it is a summoning type of magic weapon, the summoning magic weapon has been crushed. Shouldn't the summoned object itself also disappear directly?" Sun Rong sent a message with Wang Muyu was equally confused.</p>

    <p>The black coffin had been crushed by the Glazed Dragon God, and nothing was left. But the corpse dragon only suffered a moment, and quickly returned to normal. This cannot be explained by a normal summoning magic weapon. logic.</p>

    <p>The black coffin that was the base of the summons was destroyed. However, the summons still exist. This situation is indeed rare, but it is not completely impossible.</p>

    <p>"Disappeared. But not completely." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>This sounds like a Riddler-like explanation, but it's actually not difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>Because the body of this corpse dragon is spliced together, it is really related to the black coffin. It may be just one of the bones in this corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>So for the corpse dragon, the black coffin was crushed. All it lost was just one of the insignificant bones.</p>

    <p>However, this kind of splicing technology can be called a cosmic tailor. Wang Ling You can tell at a glance that it is not made by ordinary people. Chaos devices are naturally bred from the chaos of the universe. And this corpse dragon in the black coffin It definitely went through several transformations under the premise of human interference before it became what it is.</p>

    <p>After crushing the black coffin, the negative black energy that filled the core world disappeared. But this also indicates that this corpse dragon will be completely free from the suppression of the summoning magic weapon and will achieve a state of liberation.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The world began to tremble. The corpse dragon began to shine with a darkest light. The abyss-like black divine chains of order in the void were intertwined and shrouded in all directions. Suddenly, Wang Muyu's core world turned into a cage-like place.</p>

    <p>It's the breath of the Dragon God...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Muyu really felt that there was part of the Dragon God's skull on this corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>And it comes from one of the three leaders of the Dragon Clan, Cangyuan, Dark Devour, and Moonlight...</p>
