  <h1>Chapter 1284 The fun of peeking at the screen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything was as the girl expected. The amount of discussion about her topic remained high. It was discussed in almost every group.</p>

    <p>When a topic triggers national participation and discussion, all kinds of rumors will naturally follow.</p>

    <p>However, these situations have long been within the expectation of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>What the girl wanted was this effect. She wanted to see what kind of attitude the person who usually met her would take after learning that she was about to die of a critical illness.</p>

    <p>After a multi-faceted summary, Sun Rong has roughly divided the current online messages into the following categories.</p>

    <p>[1: Deep sympathy to the party]</p>

    <p>This is a group of compassionate and kind-hearted people. They are even more valuable against the backdrop of the general environment.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Wasn't the president fine when she competed a few days ago? Why did she suddenly... Who knows what hospital the president is in? I want to see her!"</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that something like this would happen to my classmate Sun Rong. Pray for her! I hope she will overcome the disease as soon as possible and get over the difficulties!"</p>

    <p>"I heard that many experts have already conducted consultations! They can definitely save classmate Sun Rong! [Pray][Pray]"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>[2: The Twilight Party]</p>

    <p>This kind of people are different from the serious "onmyoji." They belong to the Internet onmyoji!</p>

    <p>To put it simply, the words of these people seem to be good words, but there is a hint of ridicule in them, which makes people unhappy.</p>

    <p>And those with high ranks are also called: Great! Yin! Yang! Master!</p>

    <p>Junior Onmyoji: "Isn't the Huaguo Shuilian Group the strongest elixir-making company in the world..."</p>

    <p>Intermediate Onmyoji: "Hey. Mr. Sun is so rich that he can't cure his disease. How can we, the scumbags in the Foundation Building period, survive?"</p>

    <p>Senior Onmyoji: "I heard that the experts coming for this consultation are all Taishan Beidou [funny]!"</p>

    <p>The Great Onmyoji: "emm...I'm not trying to start a fight. I just want to ask. What is the origin of this person? Can he gather so many medical experts and such good medical resources? I'm envious! [So happy]"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>[3: Follow the trend and spread rumors]</p>

    <p>A great characteristic of this type of people is that they can basically selectively ignore official news. And they are endlessly interested in some gossip circulating on the Internet.</p>

    <p>The biggest difference between the so-called "following the trend and eating melon" and "ordinary eating melon" is that the people who follow the trend and eat melon will not pay attention to the authenticity of the incident. They will only believe what they believe.</p>

    <p>"I just saw the news shared by the best friend of a classmate Sun Rong in another group. It said that classmate Sun Rong most likely contracted the disease on Jiulong Mountain. I didn't expect that during the competition, she would Doing that kind of thing with some boys..."</p>

    <p>"Is it true? Isn't Mr. Sun always very discerning?"</p>

    <p>"You know people well but don't know their hearts. I didn't know that Mr. Sun was such a person. A fly will never bite an egg. I think there may be something wrong with Mr. Sun's style."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When she was still "alive", no one dared to discuss these things, whether in reality or in online chat groups.</p>

    <p>This is a novel experience!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at these chat records. I didn't feel very angry, because these were nothing but facts.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, she seemed a little excited.</p>

    <p>Because for the first time she felt the joy of peeking into the screen.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong took a screenshot of this group chat record and shared it with Zhuo Yi, Zhuo Yi smiled coldly: "Sun Rong, don't worry, schoolgirl. There are always people who will spread rumors. Real news."</p>

    <p>"I didn't care. I just thought it was a bit funny." Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong The school girl is so awesome." Zhuo Yi praised.</p>

    <p>"I have expected this to happen for a long time. Usually some people are embarrassed to say it. Now I probably know that I can't be saved. So why don't you let go of your courage?"</p>

    <p>The girl said this. She forwarded another picture to Zhuo Yi: "Zhuo Yi Senior, look. There are also P pictures!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And this is the fourth type of people summarized by Sun Rong: [P-picture party made out of nothing]</p>

    <p>"Look! I have here screenshots of classmate Sun Rong chatting with others! And someone even got the account of classmate Sun Rong's external Latte social platform.</p>

    <p>It turns out that classmate Sun Rong has always liked girls... "No way??? [eating melon]"</p>

    <p>"There are screenshots! It's absolutely true! Moreover, there are many photos of girls uploaded to Classmate Sun's external account! They are suspected to be her ex-girlfriend!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. I feel like I've eaten something big! No wonder my classmate Sun Rong rejected my confession before. It turns out she doesn't like me, but doesn't like boys..."</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong junior classmate, do you know who did it?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>In fact, if you look carefully at these circulating P-pictures, you can see that they are fake.</p>

    <p>Because the background color of the font is completely different from the background color. And the picture is slightly blurry. And there is a heavy watermark in the lower right corner of the picture...</p>

    <p>But obviously, people who are interested in spreading the news don't care about these things.</p>

    <p>They only care about how big a melon they eat.</p>

    <p>"I probably know." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>Who else could it be?</p>

    <p>It's nothing more than the group of people from the "Warrior Club." That is, a group of boys who were rejected by her and then turned negative... (For a review of the previous situation, see Chapter 1088: {The Hu Rong Club and the Warriors Can})</p>

    <p>"Do you want me to go to them and ask them to clarify?" Zhuo Yi asked with concern.</p>

    <p>Some people go to P-pictures to spread rumors and spread unfounded stories. In fact, the main reasons are nothing more than the following two points.</p>

    <p>One is that there is too little homework. The other is that I feel that I am not responsible for posting things on the Internet.</p>

    <p>It is a matter of honor for a girl. Zhuo Yi wanted to intervene directly to help Sun Rong clarify.</p>

    <p>It turns out that Sun Rong is more patient than Zhuo Yi imagined.</p>

    <p>"No need, Senior Zhuo Yi. They're all fake anyway." Sun Rong said politely.</p>

    <p>"Do you really don't have to worry about it?"</p>

    <p>"The main reason is that it's useless to take care of it now, senior Zhuo Yi. The amount of communication isn't large yet. It doesn't even meet the standards for filing a case."</p>

    <p>"So you want to..."</p>

    <p>"Let's see if there is any fermentation after that. If the spread is enough to register a case, just go directly to the source." Sun Rong said calmly.</p>

    <p>"Why do you feel like Sun Rong's junior classmate has seen many similar things?" Zhuo Yi couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Previously, a competing company spread rumors and smeared the Huaguo Shuilian Group. My grandfather also had people deal with it this way. Just bear with it for now. Take a notebook and write it down. Wait until the sentence is enough to settle the account."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>It is said that it is never too late for a gentleman to take revenge in ten years!</p>

    <p>This is the thinking of the successor of the consortium...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked through all kinds of comments on the Internet. He was very happy: "Zhuo Yi Senior, this is the first time I have discovered that peeking into the screen is so interesting."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>Although. He is sure that his master Wang Ling must also be peeking at the screen now!</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior."</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl who was immersed in the fun of peeking at the screen suddenly had another whim.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Say, what would happen if I were in a large group and sent a string of ellipses?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>This is possible.</p>

    <p>It will scare these people to death...</p>
