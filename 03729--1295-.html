  <h1>Chapter 1295 I'm scared</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's slap caught the head of the Zhou family off guard.</p>

    <p>Because of this, his impression of Wang Ling was actually very limited in this battle.</p>

    <p>After all, the head of the Zhou family has no experience of confronting the virtual body of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I cannot understand the fear of other family heads on a spiritual level.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, the head of the Zhou family thinks this may not be a good idea.</p>

    <p>Everyone here is not in their prime right now.</p>

    <p>If you are eager to attack the Liu family, what if something goes wrong... I'm afraid it will be a doomed situation by then.</p>

    <p>"There are risks in doing this. Lords, have you thought about it?" asked the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>He felt that the more times like this, the more important it was to keep his mind calm.</p>

    <p>"It's obvious now. The Wang family, the Gu family, and the Liu family are all in one... Although we are targeting the Liu family, how can you, the Lords, guarantee that the Wang family and the Gu family will not send anyone to help?"</p>

    <p>These words made the others fall into silence.</p>

    <p>Yes. They can't guarantee that the Gu family and the Wang family won't help.</p>

    <p>These two masters are both in the realm of Dao God. Their strength is far above them...</p>

    <p>They came to the Zhou family and waited for the head of the Zhou family to wake up. They thought that this time the action plan to suppress the Liu family would be supported.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the words of the leader of the Zhou family made several people fall into deep thought.</p>

    <p>"Listening to Zhou family leader's analysis, I also feel that this matter seems to be risky."</p>

    <p>"Yes. If this goes wrong... wouldn't our reputation be even more discredited?"</p>

    <p>"Everyone! There are seven of us joining forces!" At this time, the head of the Sheng family noticed something was wrong in the atmosphere. He quickly opened his eyes and said.</p>

    <p>The Wang family and the Gu family are indeed strong, but even if the seven of them join forces, they may not be able to lose!</p>

    <p>"Don't ask me about this matter. I haven't recovered from my injury. I don't want to take this risk... Lords, please go back." At this time, the head of the Zhou family sighed. He shook his head: "My Lords, please go back. I I won't give it away."</p>

    <p>The eviction order has been issued. There is no point in staying here anymore.</p>

    <p>The idea of a crusade was originally proposed by the head of the Sheng family. Naturally, he didn't want to give up. He waved his sleeves and left the place angrily.</p>

    <p>After these six family heads were sent away, Zhou Zhentian, the wealthy elder of the Zhou family, came to the solitary room on the rented land.</p>

    <p>Meet the head of the Zhou family after he wakes up.</p>

    <p>"Master, I have something to do in this pavilion. I don't know whether to talk about it or not..." Zhou Zhentian asked.</p>

    <p>"Say it." The head of the Zhou family closed his eyes and adjusted his breathing.</p>

    <p>After all, he is Dao God. He has almost recovered from the trauma on his body.</p>

    <p>Internal injuries will not heal in the future.</p>

    <p>The only regret is the loss of cultivation this time...</p>

    <p>"We have always had a good relationship with these six families... This time we have refuted the face of the head of the Sheng family on the spot. I'm afraid it will be chilling." Zhou Zhentian said.</p>

    <p>"He just wants to earn back face. Which is more important, face or life?"</p>

    <p>"What the master said makes sense..." Zhou Zhentian was surprised.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was because the "water in his brain" had flowed out. He felt that his family leader's thinking had become much clearer.</p>

    <p>"That monk is very weird. The strong men on earth are even weirder. Even the six of them can't defeat him together. So it's better to be cautious in this matter." said the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>In fact, that much has been said.</p>

    <p>In the final analysis, it can be summed up in three words: I am scared.</p>

    <p>"Later, you can choose some heavenly materials and earthly treasures from the medicine storehouse and send them to the six families. This can be regarded as a little help that I can provide." The head of the Zhou family said this. He slowly closed his eyes and said, "Step back..."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Under the instigation of the head of the Sheng family, the remaining five Dao Gods finally decided to join the war and jointly implement the plan to suppress the Liu family.</p>

    <p>They stood side by side and shuttled through the air. They jumped over the mountains and rivers and went straight to the Liu family's forbidden land.</p>

    <p>The realm of God is so vast. Normal cultivators would have to go through many twists and turns if they wanted to travel. They would even have to consider various airspace restrictions.</p>

    <p>The top ten families have other privileges.</p>

    <p>As the head of the family, a Dao God-level character can even ignore the existence of restrictions and travel across various areas.</p>

    <p>"The head of the Zhou family has said so much. To put it bluntly, he is still cowardly." The head of the Sheng family looked gloomy. He had already withdrawn from the feasibility of this operation.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for the Liu family to think that they had just experienced a big war and go directly to cause trouble for the Liu family.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the Liu family's forbidden area is far away from the Wang family and the Gu family.</p>

    <p>The heads of the two families cannot take action easily. Even if they send people to support them, they still have to rush.</p>

    <p>The six of them Dao God worked together to suppress it. The Liu family would surrender before they could wait for reinforcements to arrive.</p>

    <p>"This matter must be acted upon as soon as possible. A quick resolution!" said the head of the Li family. He also believed that this plan was feasible.</p>

    <p>At this time, the six Dao Gods were moving together in the air. The space they passed was distorted and blurred.</p>

    <p>They crossed mountains and seas and crossed mountains and seas of people. They stepped through space passages and jumped to where they wanted to go.</p>

    <p>"It's finally here."</p>

    <p>When they were still some distance away from the Liu family's forbidden area, the six Dao Gods stopped. They concentrated on adjusting their breath and quickly concentrated their energy.</p>

    <p>Ahead is a prosperous city. It is the land of the Liu family. The word "Liucheng" is engraved in large gold letters on the plaque at the city gate.</p>

    <p>They originally did not take the Liu family seriously. After all, among the ten major families, the Liu family is ranked last. Not only is its combat power and comprehensive foundation inferior to the ten major families, it is also perennially marginalized among the ten major families in the God's Domain.</p>

    <p>There is too much uncertainty in this position of tenth place. No one knows how long the Liu family can sit in the tenth place.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Liu family has been in constant turmoil since they came to power.</p>

    <p>Previously, a direct descendant passed away. She was still a girl. I don't know why she ended up on earth.</p>

    <p>It has a very bad reputation.</p>

    <p>"Ha. The six of us are gathered here now. We take action together. This also gives Liu Fengnan a lot of face." In the sky, the head of the Sheng family said with a smile.</p>

    <p>He bluntly mentioned the name of the head of the Liu family without any respect at all.</p>

    <p>The auras of six Dao Gods soared over Liucheng. Although this pressure was not as terrifying as the condensed Dao God's brain, for cultivators in the divine realm, the sense of oppression was actually not much different.</p>

    <p>Countless Liu family children and citizens in the city raised their heads one after another. There was a look of horror in their eyes.</p>

    <p>Everyone can feel that these six Dao Gods are coming with bad intentions. I am afraid they are here to provoke a war...</p>

    <p>"The six Dao Gods gathered in front of my Liu City gate. My Liu family is flourishing. I just don't know why the six Dao Gods are so aggressive..." In front of the city gate, the wealthy elders of the Liu family came to greet them.</p>

    <p>He walked out of the city. He looked down at the sky. He raised his hands and bowed. He was filled with the aura of books. He was gentle and elegant.</p>

    <p>"Six of us are here. Why don't you, the head of the Liu family, come to see you? Isn't Liu Fengnan too disrespectful to us?" The head of the Sheng family stepped forward and asked coldly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time. On Earth.</p>

    <p>The monk has projected this scene from the divine realm. It is played on the screen of the True Venerated Immortal Hall...</p>

    <p>It will still be some time before Guo Ping arrives.</p>

    <p>Before Guo Ping arrived, everyone in the True Venerated Immortal Hall was watching.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Monk, you guessed it right. They really took action." Miss Ajuan stared at the picture on the screen attentively. She did not expect that everything turned out to be as the monk expected.</p>

    <p>"The script has already been written for them..."</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together and said "Amitabha." Then he smiled and said: "You might as well take a guess. How many Dao Gods will fall in this wave?"</p>
