  <h1>Chapter 53 Elder Sister, You May Not Believe Me... </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>When a tall, pretty maiden with a beautiful figure sweetly reached out for help, undoubtedly the vast majority of men wouldn't refuse to do so. While there didn't seem to be anything wrong with her words at first, a cultivation school student would definitely sense something wasn't right.</p>

      <p>First of all, it was impossible for a spirit sword to get stuck in stone unless it was the Dashen Stone <sup>1</sup> ... otherwise, spirit swords would cut through ordinary stone like soft tofu. Furthermore, Foundation Establishment high school gyms were not open all day, and given Number 59 High School's heavily-guarded state in particular in the last two days, anyone who wanted to use the gym had to apply to do so in advance. The gym would only be open during these periods and closed at all other times.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Dashen Stone is from another Xuanhuan novel called 'Perfect World,' and is a race of 'sentient rocks' that are capable of producing offspring ... make of that what you will ...)</dfn>

      <p>The reason for this was that the gym's locker room was a surveillance blind spot; there was a high probability that criminal elements might take advantage of this weakness.</p>

      <p>Number 59 High School's school authorities had already tried almost everything they could think of to increase security. However, against an extraordinary opponent, there was nothing anyone could do about it...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Wang Ming thought that his springtime had arrived. Floating on air, he followed his attraction to the girl to the gym, but was taken aback when he realized that the main doors were locked and that the gym had already long been closed.</p>

      <p>His feverish mind finally cooled down at this scene, and the most powerful brain in Huaxiu nation began to feel that something was wrong...</p>

      <p>At this time, the girl who had been walking in front also stopped. Turning around slightly, she gave Wang Ming a sly smile.</p>

      <p>"The front doors are locked... Classmate Jiang, why don't you wait 'til tomorrow's class to ask your teacher to help you?" Her smile was strange enough to terrify Wang Ming. He wasn't a fool; officially acknowledged as the strongest research mind by Huaxiu nation, he could still read people at the most basic level even if his cultivation knowledge was limited to those ridiculous cultivation novels, and his intuition was telling him... there was something very wrong with this girl's smile!</p>

      <p>"Mr Wang Xiaoer... oh, no, it would be more proper for me to call you Mr Wang Ming, right? The most powerful brain acknowledged by the Huaxiu government?" The young girl squinted, the smile on her face remaining unchanged. "We had a hard time finding you..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ming was stunned at her words. His identity was a closely guarded secret! To outsiders, he was just Wang Xiaoer! Wang Xiaoer who lived in Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace, Tianba city!</p>

      <p>He felt his blood freeze. "Who on earth are you?"</p>

      <p>At this time, his brain cells started to spin quickly!</p>

      <p>Jiang Liuying...</p>

      <p>Somehow, he felt the name was familiar.</p>

      <p>Liuying... Liuying... Shadow Stream <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Liuying 流影 is the reverse of the pinyin for Shadow Stream, yingliu 影流.)</dfn>

      <p>Wang Ming instantly stiffened. This girl was a member of Shadow Stream?</p>

      <p>"It appears that something has occurred to our most powerful brain?" The girl shrugged off her jacket with a smile to display the gold ribbon tied around her arm, once again unnerving Wang Ming!</p>

      <p>A Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon assassin! This wasn't just an expert among assassins, but an expert among experts!</p>

      <p>Moreover, apart from displaying her rank as a Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon expert, the gold ribbon was also a symbol of her position as a senior executive of Shadow Stream.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming remembered once reading classified information put together by the research institute. Of the top five killers on the current international list of killers, Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon assassins held the second to fifth spots. As for the legendary codenamed "Teacher Killer" who was ranked first, international intelligence agencies had so far been unable to obtain precise information on this number one killer in the world...</p>

      <p>But at the moment, all of this was unimportant; the most crucial point was that Shadow Stream had unexpectedly started to take action again!</p>

      <p>The spirit sword exchange meet between the two schools was going to be held soon. Needless to say, Wang Ming knew that this group of people likely wanted to stir things up again, although he didn't feel that they could create any kind of waves with their efforts...</p>

      <p>After all, Wang Ling was here.</p>

      <p>In an extremely short span of time, Wang Ming swiftly combed through his thoughts, then looked at the girl and spoke.</p>

      <p>"Your real goal isn't me, is it?"</p>

      <p>Seeing the girl's lack of response, he said again, "Your goal is revenge. Did I guess right? Trying to kidnap me, the most powerful brain in Huaxiu nation, to use me as a bargaining chip and hijack the exchange meet between the two schools tomorrow?"</p>

      <p>Jiang Liuying smiled faintly. "Mm, let's just say you're right."</p>

      <p>"However, didn't you consider that even if you've found out who I am, my identity is still unknown to everyone else? In their eyes, you've just kidnapped an ordinary person worth nothing." After determining that the girl wouldn't hurt him for the time being, Wang Ming began to calm down.</p>

      <p>"Well then, what if we expose your real identity?"</p>

      <p>This reply surprised Wang Ming. "How does that benefit you at all?"</p>

      <p>"As long as it's unfavorable for you, it's an advantage for our Shadow Stream. Even now, when we think about it, it's still inconceivable that the Red Ribbon assassins that we had painstakingly groomed all died in such a shoddy school. The leaders of the two schools will attend the spirit sword exchange meet tomorrow... which means that all the experts will be present."</p>

      <p>"Fuck?!... Are you planning to kill them all in one go?" Wang Ming was shocked.</p>

      <p>"What's there to be shocked about? Why not? It's just two ordinary high schools. According to our intelligence, isn't the most powerful expert who will be present tomorrow only at the peak late Golden Core stage? I can squeeze someone with that level of power to death with one hand." The girl smiled sinisterly, revealing her little canine teeth.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

      <p>First of all, putting aside whether or not she would be able to squeeze Wang Ling to death... based on the results when Shadow Stream had dispatched Red Ribbon assassins last time, ending in their total elimination, he felt that Shadow Stream's executive management obviously hadn't learned their lesson at all!</p>

      <p>In other words, they didn't know what kind of enemy they were facing at all?</p>

      <p>That was Wang Ling... if his power couldn't be controlled one of these days, he would be an existence that even Wang Ming would be afraid of!</p>

      <p>"Miss, I urge you to give up on this idea immediately and go home early, your mum is calling you to go back for dinner..." Wang Ming advised her earnestly.</p>

      <p>In this world, there actually was someone even more idiotic than him!</p>

      <p>He really couldn't understand why such a cute, beautiful girl wanted to get herself killed so badly...</p>

      <p>"That won't do!"</p>

      <p>It was very clear that the girl had hardened her resolve. "We've been preparing a very long time for this revenge operation."</p>

      <p>As she spoke, the girl waved her hand and spirit light suddenly appeared at her fingertips, instantly creating a hexagonal crystal which floated in her palm. "You should be familiar with this thing, right?"</p>

      <p>"So you were the ones who stole the netherstone from the research institute!" Wang Ming stared wide-eyed; he was indeed very familiar with this object.</p>

      <p>This was a magic weapon that was still in development! The base of this magic weapon had been combined with modern space technology; it incorporated cultivation arts and black technology and was still in the testing stage. The power of this magic weapon not only enabled someone to teleport numerous times up to a distance of two hundred meters, they could also hide their aura in another dimension so that spiritual senses wouldn't be able to detect them!</p>

      <p>But such a valuable asset, fused with modern black technology, had recently been brazenly stolen from the research institute, and the Huaxiu Academy of Science had been urgently investigating the incident. Wang Ming had never expected the netherstone to fall into the hands of Shadow Stream...</p>

      <p>For this bunch of assassins, who killed without batting an eye, to have obtained the power of the netherstone... this was completely unimaginable.</p>

      <p>The young girl placed one hand on Wang Ming's shoulder, the other skillfully manipulating the netherstone. He was disoriented for just a moment, and when he came to his senses, he found himself already in the gym's locker room.</p>

      <p>"Hehe, we'll have to trouble our most powerful brain to stay here for the night before the spirit sword exchange meet tomorrow."</p>

      <p>"...May I ask, what time is it, please?"</p>

      <p>"It's almost six o'clock."</p>

      <p>"Fuck! Is it six o'clock already?" Wang Ming's eyes widened with alarm. He still hadn't delivered the new version of the Dao talisman to Wang Ling!</p>

      <p>After a simple calculation... he deduced that there already wasn't much time left before Wang Ling's old version of the Dao talisman completely expired.</p>

      <p>"Why, your mother wants you back for dinner?"</p>

      <p>Seeing Wang Ming's panic-stricken face, Jiang Liuying couldn't help smiling sweetly.</p>

      <p>After thinking calmly for a moment, Wang Ming answered seriously, "...Elder sister, you may not believe me, but if you don't let me go, the earth may be destroyed."</p>
