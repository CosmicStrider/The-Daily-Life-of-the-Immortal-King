  <h1>Chapter 86 Two-Week Semester Curse </h1>

  <div>

    <p>On May 18th, early Monday morning of the fourth week of semester, Wang Ling put on his school uniform.</p>

    <p>After washing up and tidying up his appearance, he was ready to leave. When he reached the entrance hall and opened the front door, he found his old grandfather sitting in the yard of the Wang family's small villa, quietly soaking up the rays of the sun at dawn like a starving sapling.</p>

    <p>In old age, a person's sleep cycle couldn't help becoming shorter. Wang Ling had cast a spell last night to ease his grandfather's sleep, but when it came down to it, he couldn't do anything about the old man's own biological clock.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling come outside, the old man was startled for a moment, but then gave him two lunchboxes full of food. "This is sweet and sour spare ribs and fried squid with sauce."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned. "..." Unexpectedly, it was normal home cooking!</p>

    <p>He touched the warm lunchboxes; he didn't know if the old man had remembered to put salt in the food this time, but he still couldn't help feeling moved. Just as he was about to say something, the old man pursed his lips and said, "I've been waiting at the door for a long time, but I still haven't seen my grandson. You're Jingke, right... hurry up and pass this food to my grandson."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The atmosphere in class was clearly a lot more lively than it had been when school started three whole weeks ago. The commissary in charge of studies, Su Xiao, began to collect the homework one by one. Little Peanut's real name was Su Xiao. The people in class who liked to make trouble would always deliberately write "Su Xiao" as "Su Little" <sup>1</sup> in the roster list on the blackboard.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The xiao 晓 in Su Xiao's name and the Chinese word for 'small' 小 are homophones ..)</dfn>

    <p>This was the first nickname he had been given after entering Grade One, Elite Class Three at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Like his name, Su Xiao was very small. As a boy, a height of just one hundred and sixty four centimeters was quite a damn headache. But what had to be mentioned was that he had a very good personality and had a meng and fair look; he was popular with not only teachers but also the people in class. After his classmates had become more familiar with him, they had given him another nickname, the adorable-sounding Little Peanut.</p>

    <p>Collecting homework was a technical task. Homework was always the most complete and collected the most quickly in the first two weeks of the semester, and the students were quiet and serious in class. After that, however, various problems would begin to emerge.</p>

    <p>This was the so-called two-week semester curse!</p>

    <p>Even the elite students of Number 60 High School weren't immune to this curse.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had long divided Grade One, Class Three into four main factions.</p>

    <p>First, the composed students faction, comprised of Sun Rong, Lin Xiaoyu and Su Xiao. They finished homework ahead of time, previewed lessons in advance and never panicked.</p>

    <p>Second, the normal people's party. Wang Ling considered himself a member of this faction.</p>

    <p>Third, the idiot party, comprised of those who had done the homework but hadn't brought it with them. This faction was most commonly seen in the normal and remedial classes — this phenomenon did occasionally happen in the elite class, but was still very rare in general.</p>

    <p>Fourth, the furiously copying party. The heads of this faction were none other than Chen Chao and Guo Hao these two damn fat gaming nerds.</p>

    <p>It was the members of this faction in particular that were the biggest pain in the ass for Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>"You two, I'll only give you five more minutes," Su Xiao said grudgingly as he stood in front of Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>Based on previous routine, Teacher Pan would step into the class in five minutes at the very latest to supervise their morning self-study period.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao looked at his wristwatch, assessed Chen Chao and Guo Hao's current progress in copying, then sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Collecting homework was a technical task, copying homework even more so.</p>

    <p>Glancing at the time, Chen Chao decided to speed up. He took another pen out of his stationery pouch and actually started to use both hands to write!</p>

    <p>"It's the legendary Flow of Two Pens!" Everyone in class was stunned. This was a widespread, great godly skill in school, a magic technique developed by a mysterious female senior who had been inspired by General Yi's Flow of Two Blades!</p>

    <p>The Flow of Two Pens technique involved both hands copying simultaneously, which greatly improved the transcription speed. However, it also had two weaknesses: first, the words produced by the hand unused to writing were always crooked. Second, one needed to pay close attention when copying.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao leaned forward to look curiously at Chen Chao's workbook, and his pupils contracted!</p>

    <p>Fuck! The handwriting was too neat and beautiful... this wasn't copying homework, but printing it!</p>

    <p>He had never thought there would be an expert in the Flow of Two Pens in their class.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling also felt it was slightly shameful. It was very clear that Chen Chao had already reached the pinnacle of this skill; it was impossible to achieve this level of proficiency without more than ten years of repeated practice.</p>

    <p>"I never imagined there would be someone by my side who has also mastered the Flow of Two Pens technique!" Guo Hao narrowed his eyes as he looked at Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Then, under everyone's startled gazes, he swiftly pulled a pen out of his stationery pouch and started copying the homework!</p>

    <p>— The Flow of Two Pens, again!</p>

    <p>Everyone in class was shocked.</p>

    <p>However, there were now only three minutes left...</p>

    <p>Dinglingling ! — The preparatory bell for morning self-study rang.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao looked outside anxiously, as if he could already hear Teacher Pan coming out of the office and approaching the classroom step by step!</p>

    <p>It was over... at this rate, it was already too late!</p>

    <p>In the classroom, the students around them couldn't help shaking their heads.</p>

    <p>Concentrating with all his might, both hands still writing at tremendous speed, Chen Chao suddenly roared, "It's not time to give up yet!"</p>

    <p>In that moment, he sped up again! It was as if everyone could hear the hot blood in his body pushing through his muscles! The students in class also couldn't help the way their blood fired up and boiled over...</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was a little speechless. To be so ardent even when copying homework — there was truly no one else who could do this.</p>

    <p>With two minutes to go, Chen Chao had already entered the final stage, his transcription speed almost level with that of Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Chen Chao unexpectedly took out a pen from his stationery pouch again and put it in his mouth!</p>

    <p>Instantly, countless "fuck's rang out in the class"!</p>

    <p>— Fuck! Flow of Three Pens?!</p>

    <p>The increase in speed with the Flow of Three Pens was clear to see.</p>

    <p>But it was very obvious that although Chen Chao had mastered this technique, the words written with a pen in the mouth were nonetheless much harder to read, though still decipherable.</p>

    <p>As the commissary in charge of studies, Su Xiao's jaw had already dropped with complete shock.</p>

    <p>On the other side, seeing that Chen Chao had already entered the final leg, Guo Hao unexpectedly stopped copying.</p>

    <p>Had he already given up?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes, head resting on one hand as he watched the battle between the two guys.</p>

    <p>Then Guo Hao gave an evil smile, and took out two pens from his stationery pouch.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>He silently stuck them into his nostrils.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This day, the boys and girls in Grade One, Class Three who had witnessed this scene all knelt before him!</p>
