  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1251 Where the dream begins</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Kill the Sword Master. This is a decision made out of desperation...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But whether you have the courage to implement this decision is another matter.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This matter is of great importance. Zhuo Yi dare not act rashly. And the True Lord from General Alliance has been detained again. It is assumed that the second wave of forces in General Alliance is represented by Juggernaut.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With the strength of Zhenjun, it is impossible not to notice the abnormality of General Yi. I am afraid that the negotiation is still in the stage.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Things have developed here. The situation has gradually become clearer. Now Zhuo Yi is beginning to understand a little bit. The reason why Head of State chose Huaguo Shui Lian Group.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Someone among the ten generals suffered a void invasion. This matter is of great importance and is related to top secrets.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the Head of State chooses to take action directly, I am afraid that this matter will be exposed more quickly and even more magnified. Once leaked, some unscrupulous media in border countries will exaggerate, add fuel and jealousy, and make things out of thin air. It will definitely cause a certain degree of panic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Therefore, this matter can only be "cold handled" by appointing a third party. It's just that the Head of State missed one point. That is the variable of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In this silent war, the attack of the Office of Strategic Deception not only directly disrupted the "overhead wolf" within the General Alliance, but also disrupted the rhythm of the entire Foundation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the Head of State did not stop the Office of Strategic Deception. The Office of Strategic Deception was able to form an alliance with the Huaguo Shui Lian Group so quickly. I am afraid that this was also inspired by the Head of State.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is good news.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This proves that the Head of State still gives a positive attitude to the joint action between the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shui Lian Group.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mr. Zhuo, what should we do next?" Keorn saw Zhuo Yi frowning and thinking. Zhuo Yi Even if Zhuo Yi didn't say it at this time, he could still think of the intricate relationship behind it. net.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mr. Keorn will stay here and wait for the results. Once the results of the investigation report on the orb are available, you will find a way to notify me." Zhuo Yi looked at Keorn and said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Where is Mr. Nazhuo going?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"My master deduces that the Foundation will definitely come to take revenge on me. I have to leave here quickly."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"About Snake?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm afraid so."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the information provided by Master Wang Ling so far, the messenger from the Foundation is coming in his direction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As soon as tonight, or at the latest tomorrow morning, all experts sent by the foundation will arrive!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Farewell to Snake. Zhuo Yi returned to the place where his dream began...Number 60 High School in Songhai City.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tomorrow all schools in Songhai City will be closed for three days. All teachers and staff have been evacuated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now the whole school is deserted. It is an excellent place for fighting.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time. Zhuo Yi holds Jingke in his left hand and Bai Qiao in his right hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt the sword body and the huge spiritual energy transmitted from the sword. This spiritual energy was like a tsunami of stars. After feeling it carefully, Zhuo Yi could see the endless bright galactic link...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although I only heard his master Wang Ling say it once, but after experiencing it personally, Zhuo Yi could not find any words to describe this huge power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sir Bai Qiao, please excuse me." Before entering the teaching building, Zhuo Yi waved his hand and waved Bai Qiao into the air.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The scabbard's cage was ready. He would not let any offending enemy escape alive.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Anyone who offends our country of Huaxiu will be punished no matter how far away!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then Zhuo Yi came to the principal's office and sat in Principal Chen's seat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen, a stingy guy, didn't know if he had expected that there would be a battle at Number 60 High School. He actually removed everything from his principal's office. He didn't even leave a water dispenser...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at the empty principal's office. He had no choice but to wait in front of the window.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was about ten o'clock in the evening. A strange smell came from the school gate. I stepped into Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is a violent smell in this breath. Zhuo Yi You can smell the strong smell of gunpowder from a distance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The street lights in the school square illuminated the figure of a man. He was a man with a snow-white beard. He was tall and tall, with a tall body. He was two meters tall.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Tuoyi Delei.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi stared at the man who suddenly appeared in the 60 High School campus square. He checked the information passed to him in the Sage Immortal book on his phone. It was confirmed that the man in front of him was indeed the chariot envoy Tuoyi Delei. I am correct. At this moment, he was standing in the square wearing heavy metal armor. He had a sense of sight like a Western knight. The light of the street lamp reflected on his armor, emitting an extremely thick metallic brilliance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chariot messenger. It is indeed worthy of its name.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You are actually able to calculate my location." Although Zhuo Yi changed from the very beginning, he was sure that the Foundation must have some way to find him. However, when he saw this chariot messenger appear. Zhuo Yi Still a little surprised.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's the star messenger. He has calculated your position." Tuoyi Delei smiled and said: "You killed the sun messenger. You offended the entire foundation. Do you think you can get away with it? In fact, you are like this This behavior is also a declaration of war by the League of Nations!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Apollo was a good man. He really didn't deserve this fate."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi stared at Tuoyi Delei. He sighed: "It seems you don't know what happened to Apollo."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tuoyi Delei shook his head. He had no intention of listening to Zhuo Yi's excuse: "I have heard of your reputation for a long time. It turns out that the gap between you and me is not big at all. Not only is your level low... you are only at the level of Golden Core. And he is also very eloquent. It makes people think and laugh."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I found that the people in your foundation speak Mandarin quite well." Zhuo Yi Haha.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"All cultivators under the League of Nations can speak eight languages proficiently." Tuoyi Delei said confidently: "I once had a good friend. It was you from Huaxiu."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You should know. Mr. Tuoyi Delei, the lady you are in love with, gave birth to a son for you." Zhuo Yi stared at Tuoyi Delei. He was not going to beat around the bush, but went straight to the showdown. : "You even investigated the affairs of this foreign illegitimate child..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What does this have to do with you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tuoyi Delei snorted: "I'm warning you Zhuo Yi! This matter has nothing to do with me! I have done all the safety work! It was that scheming woman who wanted to cling to me! That caused such an accident ! That’s right! It must be that woman who poked a hole in my little umbrella! She was the one who seduced me!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These words made Zhuo Yi's face gradually turn gloomy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You know, Mr. Chariot, what I hate most in my life... is people like you who shirk responsibility and don't take responsibility!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi mentioned Jingke and pointed the tip of the sword at Tuoyi Delei: "In terms of cultivation, you are indeed my senior. But whether a person can shoulder the responsibility or not has nothing to do with age..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You think you can kill me with a wooden sword?" Tuoyi Delei sneered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wrong. I'm not killing you."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi shook his head: "But I will completely destroy you, from soul to body."</p>
