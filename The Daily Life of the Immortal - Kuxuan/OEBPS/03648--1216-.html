  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1216 The immortal king’s method of catching the doll</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is true. Wang Ling can easily evoke any doll inside by using spells.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the claw machine is interesting only if you rely on technology.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">How can you kill a chicken with a bull's knife?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Using Heavenly Dao to catch dolls is a bit much!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the side, the girl's eyes were full of expectation. She could probably guess why the structure of the row of doll-catching machines in front of her looked completely different from before. This may be the result of someone secretly causing trouble.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This person. She must make good arrangements when she gets the chance again!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ling's eyes were fixed on the raccoons placed in the machine. A key factor in catching dolls is to learn to unite the mind and the eye. After Wang Ling used the three-dimensional vision of King's Eyes to observe. By analyzing the placement of each doll.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These dolls are all close together. Since they are next to each other, there will definitely be friction. The size of the friction depends on the size of the contact area when the dolls are next to each other.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After three-dimensional judgment by King's Eyes. Wang Ling quickly made the optimal judgment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He used the operating lever to move the hook over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, the ear-spoon-sized hook was too light. Before Wang Ling could use the joystick to move it to the designated position, it began to swing crazily in the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the screen, Jiang Xiaoche couldn't help laughing when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Under such difficulty, no one can successfully hook up the doll.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a nightmare level of difficulty. Unless you are a top expert in catching the doll machine, you have the same small probability of catching the doll as SSR.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When the small hook in front of him shook at a high frequency, Wang Ling had already realized how difficult it was to catch the doll purely by relying on skills.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this didn't bother him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are still 30 seconds left on this machine's countdown.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The hook in front of him was too shaky. After reaching the target, the position was still swaying. So Wang Ling got wise in a hurry. He decided to activate the second adjacent machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Come on, classmate Wang Ling!" Sun Rong didn't know what Wang Ling was going to do specifically. But he still helped Wang Ling put in the game coins very obediently.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the second machine starts, Wang Ling moves the hook of the second machine to the edge through the joystick.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Under the gaze of everyone, he began to shake the operating lever crazily!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The increase in the frequency of the joystick results in a further increase in the shaking frequency of the hook!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Suddenly. Jiang Xiaoche seemed to already know the purpose of Wang Ling: "Quick! Increase the weight of the joystick!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He operated in secret again. He increased the resistance of the joystick to the maximum. But unfortunately, this did not stop Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Report! The resistance has been increased to the maximum. But it doesn't seem to be working!" The person in charge of the adjustment frowned. They had never seen such a thing. Although the resistance had been increased to the maximum, the joystick was under the control of the boy. It still slides back and forth flexibly and freely. And the frequency of sliding is getting faster and faster.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I have to say that the quality of this joystick is indeed excellent. Even under Wang Ling's tossing, it remained strong without breaking.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When the shaking frequency reached the limit, the two hooks of the two machines on the left and right actually resonated at this moment! A strong magnetic field was formed!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Previously, the raccoon doll that was favored by Wang Ling actually floated like a magnetic levitation under this magnetic field...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong: "?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boss Sun: "?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Yiche: "?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling seized the opportunity and slapped the outside glass of the claw machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A very precise blow hit the cow across the mountain. The huge raccoon fell into the hole at the exit with great accuracy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He leaned over and picked up the raccoon doll. Wang Ling felt a sense of accomplishment in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sure enough, the claw machine is more interesting if you don’t use magic!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang LingTear off the small sticky note tied to the raccoon's tail. In fact, this sticky note is a redemption coupon. You can go to the designated store to exchange for a box of dry noodles.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And this is also the main reason why Wang Ling chose the claw machine in the first place.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If it weren't for the fact that this is an industry owned by the Sun Rong family, he can't be too high-profile. He even wanted to clear all the raccoons in this row of claw machines.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tear off the label. Wang Ling stuffed the raccoon into Sun Rong's arms.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl was surprised: "Wang Ling. Do you want to give it to me?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yeah."Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His goal is just the prize redemption note at the back. Now that the goal has been achieved, the value of the doll itself no longer exists.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You know. As a platinum member of the Gansu Noodles flagship store, Wang Ling can redeem thousands of raccoon dolls just by spending points!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, the value of this doll is still not as good as that of crispy noodles.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Thank you! I will keep it well!" The girl's face was filled with a happy smile. Thinking about it carefully, this seems to be the first time Wang Ling has given her a gift.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In front of the screen, Jiang Xiaoche's eyes twitched.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt that his eldest lady was completely broken!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, whether this claw machine or this raccoon doll, aren't they all products owned by their Huaguo Shui Lian Group?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This kid borrowed flowers to offer to Buddha, but he didn’t even bring such an offering!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche was about to complain to Sun Yiyuan, but the boss, Mr. Sun, looked at the screen and burst into tears. Jiang Xiaoche was so frightened that he suppressed all his desire to complain on the spot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boss Sun wiped his tears with a handkerchief: "Hey! I have never seen my Rongrong so happy! Not only is this boy very skilled in catching dolls, but he also knows how to please girls! I still want to catch a doll with so much effort. This is a gift for my lovely granddaughter. It is quite the style of my old husband..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche was completely speechless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Except for the day Sun Rong was born, this was the second time Jiang Xiaoche saw Boss Sun showing such an expression.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He doesn't like Wang Ling. But he doesn't dare to openly contradict Boss Sun.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Brother Jiang, they are heading towards the gold bulldozer now." At this time, the technician in charge of the operation responded with the latest situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Old rules. Increase the difficulty. Replace all the coins in the bulldozer. Replace them with the lightest ones." Jiang Xiaoche ordered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knows this video game equipment very well. Naturally, he also knows how to manipulate it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just use a light and thin coin, and then raise the slope of the opening. In this way, the game coins can be easily stacked together and will not fall off no matter how you drop them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling. This machine is so fun!" Sun Rong usually goes to the arcade. This is almost the machine she must play. The gold coin pusher is a refreshing feeling that uses game coins to make a big difference. . Hard to experience on other devices.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche himself thought that he could stump Wang Ling by tampering with him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stared at the machine. He knew in his heart that this machine had also been tampered with.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He put his hand on the glass cover angrily and cracked it gently. The game coins inside suddenly fell like a waterfall. They poured out continuously from the exit...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong estimated the number of game coins. There are probably more than three hundred coins.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Command Center. Jiang Xiaoche shouted: "This is destroying the machine! This is cheating!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Why are you yelling so loudly? Then go find the property management!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boss Sun rolled his eyes and blocked Jiang Xiaoche's mouth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, the expression on the old man's face changed quickly. He looked at Wang Ling on the screen with a kind expression. He was very satisfied. He was full of praise: "This young man is good. He not only knows how to please girls." And he knows how to manage money!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche: "..." God knows how to manage money!</p>
