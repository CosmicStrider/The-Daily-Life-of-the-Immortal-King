  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1200 Team battles can be lost. 60 must die!</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Number 60 High School's overwhelming numerical advantage seems to be a good thing. But in Wang Ling's view, it actually puts Number 60 High School on the forefront. Large-scale competitions are about checks and balances. Other schools see Number 60 High School is still full. They may not form an alliance again in the last two days to join forces and kill Number 60 High School first.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, Wang Ling's worries soon became a reality.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Now, apart from us, there are 11 schools alive among the remaining 60 or so manpower. We have received reliable information. They decided to send one person each to form a vanguard coalition to encircle and suppress us first." At noon. Sun Rong explained the current situation to everyone through Aohai's holographic water map.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After each school learned that Number 60 High School was still at full capacity, they immediately formed an 11-member coalition under the leadership of Minami Il-hide, a master in the perception department, to try to attack them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It doesn't have to be 1 for 1. Even if Number 60 High School has attrition, it would be good.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Now is the critical stage. The end of the game is calculated based on the accumulated score, survival score and additional points in the battle. In the early and middle stages of the game, everyone has adopted a cooperative method for survival. How many battle points should each school have? Not much. But if we can hold on with our numerical advantage, our Number 60 High School can gain a huge advantage by relying on the survival score. We may even win directly!" Sun Rong said with confidence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The survival score accounts for the largest proportion. At the final settlement of the survival battle on the eighth day, points will be settled based on the final number of delegations sent by each school. If one person survives, 100 points will be added.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If Number 60 High School still has no attrition on the last day, it can open up points with a big gap between the schools...Compared to relying on battle accumulation to gain points, this is the fastest way.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Here Sun Rong is discussing the battle plan. Wang Zhen and Gu Shunzhi are looking at the sky in boredom. This game has almost no suspense for Number 60 High School. It is almost the last day of Number 60 High School. No one here was killed... This actually feels a bit unreal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They came to learn acting from Wang Ling. But this acting was nothing like it!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, the following dialogue occurred in an independent mental space.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhenyuan hissed: "Did we act too fake? It's almost over. No one fell down?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Gu Shunzhi nodded. He agreed with Zhenyuan's point of view: "What Venerated Immortal said makes sense. I also think it's a bit fake. How about someone show me how to make my death more natural?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Liu Qingyi quickly planned: "This Wang Zhen is good at it!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. Just after Sun Rong had just formulated a plan to fight the enemy, Wang Zhen began to drag Liu Qingyi and others to an appointment to jump off the cliff.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This was a strategy jointly discussed by Gu Shunzhi and others.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If Number 60 High School really wins the championship with a big gap, this may be a bit of a hatred... So after Gu Shunzhi's calculations, the four of them are now withdrawing from the competition. Not only can they help other schools save some face, but they can also Narrow the gap between victory and defeat. Help Number 60 High School win the competition with a small gap!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course, if the dance is too direct, it will feel like a blatant act. So it is very important to act realistically.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A leap of faith. This is a very romantic thing. Especially when men and women match up, there will be a special feeling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So on the evening of the seventh day, the vanguard of the "Number 60 High School Must Die" alliance composed of the remaining 11 schools, headed by Nanhai Tianzhong and Titan High School, received a brand new message.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The message is simple.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Number 60 High School. Four people were "killed" in action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"???" Nan Yixiu's first reaction after hearing the news was naturally a black question mark on his face. Their premeditated attack has not even started. Why are there four people gone?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I heard that at first someone was collecting spiritual fruits on the cliff and fell down the cliff. Then the people behind went to catch them. In the end, they were all taken down."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is everyone okay..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Triggered the protective golden light.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What can happen..."..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I don't know why. Nan Yixiu didn't seem so happy when he heard the news. Instead, he felt there was an aura of conspiracy in it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is the captain of this vanguard force. He originally planned to launch a sneak attack on the Number 60 High School camp at night. The main reason is because Number 60 High School is currently full. This is very detrimental to other schools. But now Four people were killed in the battle. In fact, in theory, there was no need to organize this operation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Number 60 High School must die the eleven members of the vanguard team. Except for Nan Yixiu himself, the others are representatives of the middle-level combat effectiveness of each school that he has carefully selected. The combat effectiveness of the middle-level is also critical at the moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now the number of students at Number 60 High School is basically the same as that of major schools. There is really no need to take risks anymore.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Nan Yixiu always feels that there is something fishy about this matter...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He spent six days getting along with people from Number 60 High School. The overall combat effectiveness of Number 60 High School was not outstanding. The overall combat effectiveness of the entire school was relatively at the middle level of other schools.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although classmate Sun Rong is indeed very good, in a team game, it is useless for one person to be excellent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, a drop of rain fell on the tip of Nan Yixiu's nose, and then exploded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nan Yixiu raised his head. Suddenly he realized that there was a continuous drizzle in the sky. This kind of weather was actually extremely detrimental to a sneak attack.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although they have come, it seems that there is really no need for a sneak attack at the moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">None of them took action. Number 60 High School had already lost four people.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, at the next moment, Nan Yixiu's expression changed drastically: "Not good!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What's wrong?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"We have fallen into a trap!" Nan Yixiu suddenly had a flash of inspiration and realized that there was a huge crisis here!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's a pity that everything is too late. In the dense forest with mountains in the distance, there are already several protective golden lights rising into the sky!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's over...it's all over..." Nan Yixiu looked at more and more golden light beams. The expression on his face could not hide his despair. He had completely missed the important factor of weather!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Especially in operations on rainy days. For Sun Rong who has awakened the sword spirit, her Aohai sword can almost occupy an absolute advantage! It is like a home battle, and she can use the power of the rain to identify the position of each of them. . Then control the sword energy remotely to defeat them one by one!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Maybe it's hard to do it with the strength of Sun Rong alone. But there are still 6 people in Number 60 High School's camp.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In addition, Sun Rong collected various materials when using the coalition forces in the past few days. Combined with their own elixir-making machine, they quickly refined elixirs that can quickly repair spiritual energy... in this heavy rain. Sun Rong can almost be described in four words: do whatever you want!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I can only say that she is worthy of being the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group and the captain of Number 60 High School... She can actually scheme to this extent!</p>
