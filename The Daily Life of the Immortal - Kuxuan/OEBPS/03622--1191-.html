  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1191 The King of Wild Poison</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All kinds of unheard of magical moves. This is what makes Wang Zhen feel the weirdest thing about the people behind the scenes. The spells on the opposite side are a bit off-beat. They don't look like Heavenly Dao spells, let alone spells in the divine realm... Could it be that they come from Fate and Fate? Heavenly Dao? Contrast. Wang Zhen was puzzled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Instead, it was the ancient and evil forbidden art of the Universe Formation Array. Wang Zhen had seen it in the relevant classics in the God's Domain. However, the books he had seen were all theoretical research on this forbidden art. From then on, No one has actually operated and implemented it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Such an evil magic circle, most likely there are sacrifices..." At this time, Wang Zhen connected the sacrifices with Mr. Huang's transfer. Suddenly, another bold idea came to his mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The other party kidnapped Mr. Huang. The reason may not only be to transfer Mr. Huang to better invade the Huaxiu Alliance's command system.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen feels that a large part of the reason may be related to the consideration of sacrifices.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A powerful person like Huang Lao is the first choice to serve as a sacrifice. And obviously, the other party wants to arrange such an evil cosmic-level magic circle. I am afraid that Huang Lao is not the only sacrifice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In this regard, Wang Zhen made a new deduction: "Those resurrected people, after awakening Shadow, the strong ones were pushed out as chess pieces to delay the time. The weak ones may be re-introduced as sacrifices."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I think your inference is completely reasonable." Li Huanran also felt that Wang Zhen's answer was completely logical.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is not much time left for them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Once the refining array is started, the altar is the first place to suffer. And destroying the altar will also affect the operation speed of the refining array to a certain extent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words, only by destroying the altar can they buy time to deal with the person behind the scenes!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"In the fifth area!" At this time, Li Huanran felt the memory fragments in his mind flashing again. He thought of some key information. He immediately shared it with Wang Zhen and others through the mental space: "This is the circle. The stalactite cave facing the wind. The main valve of Tianmai is located! The center of the fifth area is closest to the main valve. There is no place more suitable for setting up an altar than there! In my memory, many resurrected people seem to be there!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How many do you remember?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No less than a few hundred! But they are currently in a semi-finished state. They have not yet fully developed!" Li Huanran answered quickly. The snow-white flowers in the memory are deep in the fifth area. The white flowers all over the ground are here. In the dim stalactite cave, it actually seemed a bit dazzling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The incident was more serious than Wang Zhen imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Due to the extreme urgency, Wang Zhen judged that the mission plan for this time may have to be changed... At present, their first priority is to destroy the altar. Because the altar will greatly increase the opening speed of the formation formation, another team must be dispatched. Just send someone to deal with the people behind the scenes!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Are we going to ask Little Master Lingzi for help after all?" It is not difficult to predict this result. It is because the cunning of the man behind the scenes has exceeded their imagination.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the difficulties before them were far more than that. On the way to the altar, they had to encounter many "resurrectionists" who deliberately came out to obstruct them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Huanran's level is only in the second district.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the following areas, the people guarding the gates will be stronger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the facts prove that it is indeed the case.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The gatekeeper in the third area is a middle-aged man who looks like he is wearing a suit and leather tie. The man is a little fat. He wears a single-sided spectacles. His whole body exudes the aura of an aristocrat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I know him." Li Huanran immediately recognized the origin of this person.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who is this person?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mr. Wu Xiaolang, who is known as the Demon Chef of the Wilderness." Li Huanran said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wilderness Demon Chef?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"He is a chef who specializes in cooking game. Back then, Wu Xiaolang made a mistake in making a bat sashimi dish. As a result, those who enjoyed the sashimi and Wu Xiaolang himself were infected by wild bat viruses. Moreover, what Wu Xiaolang cooked at that time was the giant bat king. . His body contained hundreds of deadly viruses...these viruses continued to spread and cross-infection, almost causing a city to fall." Li Huanran talked about the past events of that year: "And Wu Xiaolang died at that time. ."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If you don't eat good food, you have to eat game. It's really your own fault." Wang Zhen sighed. There are many spirit beasts in the world. Some spirit beasts are specially bred artificially for food. But some wild spirit beasts have It contains natural viruses. If you eat wild spiritual animals to satisfy your appetite, it is not worth pitying you if you contract the virus and die.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you have his photographic information?" At this time, Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes." In the mental space, Jiang Yingyue quickly replied: "His shadow is called the King of Wild Poison. He can use his shadow to spread a powerful virus that makes people unable to breathe. The poisoned person will slowly feel weak and fearful. Cold, unable to control the output of spiritual power, and finally losing the ability to breathe little by little."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's really tricky...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After hearing this, everyone began to look cautiously.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side. Wang Ling received the news from Er Ha.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen, Er Ha, and Xiao Yin are just the vanguard spy troops sent by Wang Ling. Judging from the intelligence returned so far, the situation is far worse than Wang Ling thought.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Huang is suspected of being transferred and serving as a sacrifice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A cosmic-level refinement formation...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These are important information currently investigated by Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although there are not many, all of them are valuable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because Wang Ling doesn't know what means the people behind the scenes used to prevent him from tracking the other party's clues. But now that he has this information and reverse tracking, Wang Ling feels that it may not be possible to complete this matter. It's too difficult.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Since the other party's purpose is to arrange a cosmic-level refinement circle, they will definitely send manpower to maintain the heavenly veins on other planets for the sake of the magic circle, so as to ensure that when the earth's heavenly veins main valve is opened, other planets will have the opportunity. We can all work together in an instant!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words, the opponent must be in the center of the formation, which is the eye of the formation, to supervise the work!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the position of the array eye is probably right above the sun...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling raised his head and stared at the sky with King's Eyes. Due to the climate problem these days, the Jiulong Mountain area has been covered in fog. Thick clouds and fog blocked the sun. Actually, Wang Ling has been ignoring it. Knowing the fact that the other party is hiding in the sun.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a cunning opponent right before your eyes...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">More cunning than any of them before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This matter cannot be delayed any longer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling is going to take a look at the sun. Get everything done as soon as possible.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling. You are staring at the sky. Do you want to bask in the sunshine?" At this time, Sun Rong beside him suddenly asked with concern.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She knew that it was difficult for the sun to show its face these days because of the climate.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But considering that Wang Ling is the "group favorite" after all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In addition, it is due to my responsibility as the captain of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When a classmate wants to bask in the sun, the captain must of course be obligated to meet the needs of the team members.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Sun Rong directly took out a walkie-talkie and began to direct the security team of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group in the Jiulong Mountain area: "The missile team of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group listen to my order! Launch cloud-clearing missiles immediately! I want to see The sun today!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>
