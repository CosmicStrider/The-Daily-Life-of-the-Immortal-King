    <p>Whether it was the heavenly silkworm potato strips or the bloody hell tomatoes...</p>

    <p>These names, as always, conveyed the violent nature of Mother Juan's domineering temperament.</p>

    <p>However, today's dishes seemed fairly normal, so everyone breathed sighs of relief in their hearts.</p>

    <p>When Teacher Wang picked up a tomato slice with his chopsticks, Mother Juan immediately took out the seasoning bag she carried to pour three spoons of sugar on it, and then she beamed at Teacher Wang. "Three spoons of sugar with the bloody hell tomato makes it even better!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>After eating Mother Juan's love bentos, everyone escorted her to the school gate and waved goodbye to her in the breeze.</p>

    <p>Though the taste of the love bentos was still so strange, they were still very touched by her good intentions.</p>

    <p>After checking numbers and discovering that six people had not been accounted for, this old auntie had immediately remembered the group of Number 60 High School students that was attending the exchange meet for two schools, and so had arrived travel-stained to deliver the love bentos that could only be eaten on Fridays.</p>

    <p>It was worth mentioning that Mother Juan would count precisely how many bentos she needed to make, no more and no less. No one else in Number 60 High School could do that except for her. This old auntie, who had been head cook at Number 60 High School for hundreds of years, truly had every student and every teacher in her heart.</p>

    <p>"Goodbye, students! For tomorrow's spirit sword exchange meet, if I have the opportunity, I'll come again! Kiss~"</p>

    <p>Mother Juan waved to everyone, blew them a kiss which made them shudder, then stepped onto her Louis Vuitton flying sword and vanished into the distance.</p>

    <p>On the eve of the spirit sword exchange meet, a lot more things out of the ordinary seemed to be cropping up.</p>

    <p>Just as Mother Juan left, both of Wang Ling's eyelids began to twitch.</p>

    <p>...Disaster level, two stars.</p>

    <p>He could roughly guess what was about to happen. The Dao talisman seal on his arm was about to expire. Looking at the time frame, it wasn't difficult to figure out... it was very obvious, that guy was coming.</p>

    <p>That hateful guy whom Mother Wang had contacted previously.</p>

    <p>From a young age, Wang Ming had always been a huge headache for Wang Ling. Although Wang Ming's identity had been classified as a state secret and he was always lavished with praise for his brain, which was deemed an existence more terrifying than any divine weapon, Wang Ling's impression of his cousin still centered around those ninety-nine stupid challenges... bluntly speaking, this guy was a dumbass.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this idiocy was also reflected in various other ways.</p>

    <p>Of all the stupid things that he did, the one he most enjoyed doing and never grew tired of was to disguise himself as a cultivator...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was four-thirty in the afternoon on Thursday.</p>

    <p>School had let out on time at Number 59 High School. Students walked out of the teaching building and exited the school gate in twos or threes.</p>

    <p>At this point in time, a man was standing at the school gate. He was dressed in rough linen and had neatly trimmed, thick black hair. The man carried a long sword weighing one hundred jin <sup>1</sup> on his back, like a seasoned practitioner who had wandered the world over. Unfortunately, this attire and temperament didn't really match, so people with a higher spiritual realm would immediately know... this was a muggle with no spirit energy whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Every cultivator possessed an essence in their being which came from nature; it formed in a person's <em>dantian </em>region and flowed through the body's meridians. This essence could gradually change a person's inner temperament and then move outward to make a person's countenance dazzle with radiance and their steps become light as wind. The body of a true cultivator could even emit a faint fragrance.</p>

    <p>Standing at the gate of Number 59 High School, Wang Ming secretly sighed in his heart; he was young and had potential, was handsome and talented... but being talented was not a replacement for practice. He had realized at a very young age that he couldn't cultivate because of his physique. It was for this reason that he had devoted all his energy to scientific research.</p>

    <p>Looking eagerly at the Foundation Establishment high school students that passed him by, his eyes couldn't help revealing a little envy... if it wasn't because of his physique, with his own natural talent at cultivation, someone as insignificant as Wang Ling would be no match for him at all!</p>

    <p>Such were Wang Ming's self-pitying thoughts in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Are you looking for someone, sir?" Number 59 High School's old guard approached him a little warily.</p>

    <p>With the spirit sword exchange meet happening tomorrow, Number 59 High School's on-campus personnel had increased their vigilance against suspicious people. Even guardians or family members entering the school had to inform a teacher in advance, and only after the teacher gave the school guard office approval would they be allowed to enter. But this man had been standing and sighing at the school gate for twenty minutes, which the old school guard thought was a little strange.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at the old uncle and shook himself to clear his head. "Hello, fellow cultivator, I'm here to look for someone..."</p>

    <p>Being called a fellow cultivator made the old uncle feel somewhat decrepit. He carefully looked Wang Ming up and down again. "You are... a guardian?"</p>

    <p>He was also a cultivator. His realm wasn't too high, but he was still capable of detecting the essence of a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Only great men who possessed exceptional realms would call each other fellow cultivators. The old uncle stared at Wang Ming's face for a long time, but no matter how much he looked, he felt this person wasn't anything special... conversely, the more he looked, the more suspicious he became.</p>

    <p>"Yes yes yes, I'm a guardian. I'm looking for someone."</p>

    <p>According to seniority in the family, Wang Ming figured he was, after all, an older brother. He was six whole years older than Wang Ling; there was nothing wrong with saying he was a guardian, so he nodded.</p>

    <p>"Whose guardian are you? Which class is the student in?"</p>

    <p>"I'm looking for Number 60 High School's Wang Ling... he's participating in the exchange meet on behalf of his school."</p>

    <p>The old uncle instantly understood that it was that group of people.</p>

    <p>However, he still had doubts about Wang Ming's identity as a guardian. Shouldn't the guardian of a Foundation Establishment student have reached the Golden Core stage at the very least?</p>

    <p>Most of the teachers in the school were at the Golden Core stage, so the old uncle often encountered such people and hence could identify such an aura.</p>

    <p>...It was very obvious that this man had no spirit energy whatsoever!</p>

    <p>Considering the recent incident with the notorious Shadow Stream at Number 60 High School, he couldn't help but wonder... over the past two days, the higher-ups had issued clear orders to take precautions for fear that Shadow Stream would take advantage of the spirit sword exchange meet to retaliate.</p>

    <p>Now, people who wished to enter Number 59 High School were strictly examined, and expert overseers as well as patrol personnel had been arranged one after another as security inside the school. To be honest, the old uncle didn't think Shadow Stream would have the guts to brazenly infiltrate the school.</p>

    <p>However, this young man pretending to be a cultivator had succeeded in attracting his attention...</p>

    <p>The old guard had retired from the cultivation police's criminal investigation department a few years ago. Based on his years of experience, he now had reason to be suspicious; it was possible that the young man before him was a spy that had been dispatched to try and infiltrate the school...</p>
