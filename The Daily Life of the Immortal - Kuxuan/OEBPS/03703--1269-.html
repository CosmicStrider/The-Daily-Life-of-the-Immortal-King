  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1269 Seducing the Golden Men</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He actually asked your brother to leave the King's Eyes to him...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I have to say that Zen Master Jin Deng’s words were astonishing and scared Lord Diu Lei on the spot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He never thought that the other party would make such a condition.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the one hand, the King's Eyes are not his. He has no right to make the decision.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the key is, if he really hands over his King's Eyes, does Zen Master Jin Deng really have a solution?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You must know that the weirdness of this matter far exceeds anything before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even Brother Ling seems to be unable to come up with an effective solution for the time being.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This matter, the true king can make a decision after discussing it with friends."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the rhythmic wooden fish sound of the Main Hall sounded again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng closed his eyes slightly and looked untroubled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei was sweating on his forehead.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng clearly did not put pressure on him intentionally. But now he was in a very nervous mood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Originally, Diu Lei thought that after knowing Wang Ling, he would no longer be touched by any strange things happening in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he never thought that the Zen Master Jin Deng in front of him would give him a great sense of oppression.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And he began to become more and more curious about the identity of this hidden Zen master who had reincarnated 3910 times...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"My identity. Sooner or later, the True Lord will know it."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Zen Master Jin Deng spoke again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei found that his "spiritual barrier" to prevent prying eyes was completely useless in front of Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk knocked on the wooden fish without squinting. But he could clearly know what he was thinking.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"In addition, I want to remind Zhenjun one thing." After the palace was silent for a long time, Zen Master Jin Deng spoke.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Master, please speak..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Time waits for no one in this matter. I have been reincarnated thousands of times. No one can be as patient as me. The poor monk can wait, but the girl cannot wait. Using a death talisman to take one's life is not a long-term solution. "</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I understand."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei bowed again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Do you really want to give King's Eyes away?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">How should he talk to brother Ling about this matter?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This has become an immediate problem again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side. Death Heavenly Dao arrived at the hospital successfully under the leadership of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The hospital is heavily guarded and all the staff are busy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When we arrived at the entrance of the hospital, Death Heavenly Dao was driving up to two seductress Golden Men sent by Heavenly Dao. They helped a kind-looking grandmother to walk up the steps of the hospital and come out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is someone who just passed away from the hospital.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the kind smile on the old woman's face, it was obvious that she left without any worries and very peacefully.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a person who died at the end of his life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao can be seen at a glance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moreover, the old lady has a faint Dharma light on her body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is a coat formed by condensing the kind thoughts in daily life. It protects the soul from the pain of cold after leaving the body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This scene is invisible to others.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After Zhuo Yi was granted partial sharing permissions for "King's Eyes", it was the first time I saw such a scene. I was amazed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Seen Lord Death!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The little Golden Men responsible for seducing souls saw Heavenly Dao arriving in human form and bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They knew that Heavenly Dao above had sent two major envoys to the lower realm to investigate about a girl.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao was shocked. All the little Golden Men responsible for seduction had also held a large gathering before and counted the number of people.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Result. Not a single little Golden Men is missing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone is working diligently according to their daily plans.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you have any clues?" Zhuo Yi asked as he led the dead Heavenly Dao towards Sun Rong's special care ward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao shook his head: "Honestly, I'm still confused. I don't know what happened. If only Dao Ancestor was here..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is Dao Ancestor Wang immortal?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"We have always felt that Dao Ancestor is not dead. He is just entering his own reincarnation. However, Dao Ancestor has indeed disappeared for too long. It has been ten thousand years since he established the Heavenly Palace. There is no trace yet."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You can't find it?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"He guesses. Dao Ancestor doesn't want us to find him."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao said: "I tell you this. This is all for Ling Zhenren's sake. If you weren't his disciple, you have no right to know."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi was shocked: "What is the relationship between my master and Dao Ancestor Wang?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao smiled. He let it slip: "It cannot be said."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I understand." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knew clearly in his heart that this might be the legendary "secret that cannot be revealed".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After Wang Zhen, a group of people from the God Realm determined to stay on earth to practice cultivation, Zhuo Yi also learned more about the epic cultivation epic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are some things you can know, but knowing too much about some things is not good for you.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi is full of curiosity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he is also a law-abiding person.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao had reached this point, and he decided not to ask any more questions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If there is a chance in the future.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He believed that his master would tell him personally.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But now he only needs to know Ling Zhenren and that's all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sir, this is Miss Sun Rong's ward."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A few minutes later, the two arrived at the special care ward of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The black-clad bodyguards of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group stood in front of the door. They were meticulous. They were like two door gods.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You two, I was entrusted by Zhenjun to bring a senior to show Miss Sun the situation." Zhuo Yi said pleasantly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then he took out the visit card he had prepared in advance from his pocket.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is issued by Mr. Boss Sun. Only insiders have it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Please come in." The two bodyguards looked at each other and then made way.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Boy, besides us, has anyone else been here today?" Zhuo Yi asked again before entering the door.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">One of the bodyguards sighed: "In addition to Lord Diu Lei, there are also several experts who came from other cities. But after seeing it, they all shook their heads and said that the situation is not good."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I believe Miss Sun will recover."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi clasped his fists: "The senior I invited doesn't want others to disturb him when he's seeing a doctor. Before we come out, I'd like you to close the door and prevent others from breaking in."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't worry, Chief Zhuo." The two bodyguards nodded seriously.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then he led Heavenly Dao into the ward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong was lying quietly in the medical cabin. The girl's sleeping face was touching.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"She is such a lucky girl. She has alarmed so many people."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at the girl. He smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao was not polite either. He sat down directly on the spot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi asked: "Lord Death Heavenly Dao. What shall we do next?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao crossed his arms. His face was serious: "There is nothing to do. I can only wait. I want to see who did it."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now, the consumption rate of death talismans has increased to the level of one in half an hour.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao calculated the time. He had a hunch that Sun Rong was not far away from the next seduction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And about five minutes later, outside the special care ward of Sun Rong, a heavy sound of chains was heard...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a sound that makes people’s souls tremble involuntarily!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi started to tremble uncontrollably: "Sir... this is..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't panic...the seducer is here..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao put his hand on Zhuo Yi's shoulder, stabilizing Zhuo Yi's mood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, he was also extremely surprised in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Heavenly Dao and the charming little Golden Men under him are all quality law enforcers!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But where does the hostility outside the ward come from?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi Senior?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, Zhuo Yi was surprised to find that he heard the voice of a girl.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The soul of the girl who was lying quietly was actually affected by the chain and was forced out of her body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The first thing she saw was Zhuo Yi and a young man wearing overalls standing beside her bed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao quickly stretched out his hand and pulled the girl's soul behind him, guarding it tightly like an old hen protecting its chicks.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What on earth is going on?" The girl was full of doubts.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because of the influence of the scapegoat, every time the girl is resurrected, she will forget the memory of the last time she was seduced.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sun Rong, don't worry, schoolmate. I will explain to you later. This senior and I are here to save you." Zhuo Yi looked at Sun Rong and said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The words just fell!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Buzz!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A huge chain with a golden hook. Just ignore the door of the ward and walk through the door!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He grabbed the girl's smooth and beautiful collarbone...</p>
