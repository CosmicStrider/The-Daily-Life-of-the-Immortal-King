  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1211 Look how scared this kid is</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sunday, November 22nd, the ninth day of the National Cultivation School Physical Martial Arts Competition. Students from hundreds of schools across the country gathered in neat squares at the square of Jiulong Mountain Base.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can be seen that compared with the beginning, the delegations sent by each school basically have fewer people. Some students suffered accidental fractures or other more serious injuries during the competition. After statistics and reporting by the leading teacher, you can I am exempt from attending the closing ceremony.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong did not come.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, Sun Rong had already woken up a long time ago. But Mr. Sun, the boss of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group, was worried. He took Sun Rong back overnight for a more detailed examination.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All in all, this national gymnastics competition ended with a one-sided team show by Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Many people sighed inwardly at the drama of the competition.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, there are also many people who have accumulated resentment in their hearts.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Before the competition started, no one would have thought that Number 60 High School would end up leading the other teams by a large margin in the form of extra points for essay writing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What about the physical arts exchange competition we talked about!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling thought of the previous time in the Spirit Sword Competition with the 59th High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Their spiritual swords didn't have many opportunities to show off. Unexpectedly, they ended up making the same mistake again in this national physical training competition.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Life is indeed a circle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the competition is not without exciting fighting scenes. For example, the Golden Core peak showdown between Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong. All the fighting scenes in this game can be taken out and savored over and over again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the playground. Wang Ling looked at the surrounding environment with his peripheral vision. He found that many people were looking at him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knew it in his heart. The reason why he received so much attention was definitely not because of the battle with Minami Il-soo. It was the essay written by his real alter ego "Crispy Noodles" after the game that made him famous...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Who knew things would develop like this!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the way back to Songhai City on the air immortal ship, Wang Ling was worried about one thing. That was whether Father Wang would deduct his pocket money for any reason.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This national competition caused him to cause too much trouble. Now the whole school... no. The entire Ten Thousand Schools Alliance knows that he writes well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, Zhuo Yi knows that he always likes to keep a low profile and does not like to engage in such eye-catching operations. So Zhuo Yi has already spread rumors to the outside world. It is claimed that Wang Ling's composition this time is just " A flash in the pan."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When it comes to writing a composition, as long as there are no mistakes in the words and sentences, it largely depends on inspiration and luck. A person cannot guarantee that he can write a golden sentence all the time. Sometimes a very cool sentence suddenly comes to his mind. sentence. It’s really just that inspiration suddenly came online.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, how many people can accept this statement? Wang Ling I don’t know.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Anyway, on the way back, everyone on the aerial immortal ship admired Wang Ling. Especially Tang Jingze. It can almost be described as being in awe.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling. Your composition is great! You are like a contemporary Lu Shu person!" Tang Jingze carefully studied the sentences in the composition.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His favorite phrase is: "A Grain of Ash in Time. Falling on an individual's head. It's like a mountain."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What kind of literary talent does it take to write such great sentences?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Incredible, incredible...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The most excited person is Wang Ling’s Chinese teacher: Guan Ziqian.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Teacher Guan is a very low-key person. He rarely shows his face.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is a very low-key office worker. Of course, there is nothing to say about his professional ability.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guan Ziqian has always criticized Wang Ling's compositions. It's not that Wang Ling's writing is not good. It's that Wang Ling's writing is too plain! It's like a running account. The arguments are all old-fashioned! In exam-oriented essays, Wang Ling’s essay can barely be considered above passing grade. But such an essay will never achieve high scores.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. When this essay titled {{id}} was exposed in the national competition, Teacher Guan, who usually didn't talk much in the group, actually directly disclosed Aite Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"@Wang Ling Are you finally enlightened?" Teacher Guan sent a face-covering smile: "How do I feel?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Does your composition look like a ghostwriter?" Wang Ling looked at the class group teacher's question. After thinking for a long time, he trembled and replied with two words: "No."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest, Wang Ling felt guilty when these two words were typed on the screen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Teacher Guan was not polite when he saw the reply. He directly responded publicly in the group: "Then what's going on with your usual compositions? Are you acting like me?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hit the mark.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling was so frightened that he broke out in cold sweat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, Mr. Wang Zukang came out in time to smooth things over for Wang Ling: "Classmate Wang Ling is a contestant who occasionally performs well. Teacher Guan, don't worry about it so much." He saw Wang Ling looked pitiful while holding the phone. He still felt a little distressed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Look how scared this kid is!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Teacher Guan was obviously joking.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The students he taught wrote such excellent essays in a national competition. I was very happy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He stopped typing. He directly praised Wang Ling publicly in the group by voice: "Wang Ling. This fully illustrates that you actually have potential only if you have writing skills. I doubt that you wrote before My composition may be due to lack of time and too much tension. If I give you enough time, even if your performance is not as good as this time, at least it will be at an average or even upper level!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling still doesn’t have the guts to reply.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The reason was that he felt that there was something in what Teacher Guan said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As expected. Teacher Guan said next: "Wang Ling. There will be an essay competition in the district in the middle of next month. The teachers in our language group have been discussing for a long time who our school should send. Why don't you do it?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Teacher Guan: "This time it all depends on your composition. It helped our school win the national competition. I think the other teachers in the Chinese language group have no objection. People are all forced to come out. Since you have potential, then you should do it." Give yourself appropriate pressure, understand? This is for your own good, teacher."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knew that things would develop like this!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">We took the immortal ship back to the playground of Number 60 High School. It was already afternoon. Wang Ling was preparing to go home. As soon as we left the school gate, we heard someone shouting on the road: "A Grain of Ash in Time! A Grain of Ash in Time!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"..."Wang Ling turned around and saw a passerby looking at him happily. It was a middle-aged woman who was taking her daughter home from school.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the girl's clothes, she should be from Qingyun Elementary School, which is Xiuzhen Elementary School near Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Have you seen that brother! A Grain of Ash in Time!" The middle-aged woman squatted down and said excitedly to her daughter. She forgot what Wang Ling's name was. But she still based it on Wang Ling’s composition. The scene gave Wang Ling a unique nickname.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Namely: A Grain of Ash in Time...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You should learn like that brother. His compositions are so good!" The middle-aged woman was very excited.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mom! That brother is eating crispy noodles!" The little girl pointed at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Let's go! Let's buy it too! Eat it! Maybe your shitty composition can be as good as your brother's!" The middle-aged woman became even more excited.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling’s mouth twitched.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It looks like he is really famous now.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even his face was started to be snatched by people...</p>
