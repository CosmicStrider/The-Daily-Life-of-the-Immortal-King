  <h1>Chapter 29 In the Flush of the Spring Wind the Horse Runs Fast... </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>Society was vicious; even Wang Ling himself felt that there were two groups that he absolutely couldn't mess with. They were the Han Family Army and the Wang Family Army.</p>

      <p>These two fan groups of the Ancient Almighty Cultivators were more terrifying than fans of A-list celebrities in Huaxiu nation.</p>

      <p>Each fan club had tens of millions of fans and every single one of them was a cultivator. Furthermore, the presidents of both fan clubs were rumored to be first-class expert cultivators.</p>

      <p>Huaxiu nation had been trying to crack down on these two powerful fan clubs over the years, and had informed local education offices to strictly prohibit students and teachers from secretly joining them. To the military, they were both unpredictable factions that might or might not become a threat to national security someday.</p>

      <p>But that had nothing to do with Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>This could be summed up in a great saying...</p>

      <p><em>Do what you want to do, I won't bother with you.</em></p>

      <p>As long as it was something that didn't affect his low-key life, he could turn a blind eye to it. Otherwise, if he moved even just a finger, he could make these tens of millions of people disappear...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>It had already been one hour since the bus had departed, but Guo Hao had no intention of stopping; he had no lack of topics to discuss, from the latest news headlines to slowly chatting about national affairs. He lamented the hard lives led by the lower classes in society and educated the people present on patriotic affairs at the same time.</p>

      <p>Nanhan nation's insistence on deploying an "Immortal Sword Defense System" along the border had aroused strong protest from Huaxiu nation.</p>

      <p>The common people didn't discuss politics. Wang Ling himself was accustomed to being idle, but he still at least knew something about this major issue.</p>

      <p>Huaxiu nation had imposed various economic sanctions on Nanhan nation, resulting in the closure of many Nanhan family supermarket chains in Huaxiu and the removal of Nanhan food imports from market shelves. These included the spicy chicken-flavored <sup>1</sup> crispy noodle snack which Wang Ling preferred and which was produced in Nanhan.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is referring to Samyang 'Hot' chicken flavor instant noodles from South Korea.)</dfn>

      <p>But crispy noodle snacks were a petty problem in the face of a national issue.</p>

      <p>It was just one less flavor, Wang Ling could completely accept that. Locally made crispy noodle snacks might be a little lacking in novel flavors, but ultimately nothing could beat the classics...</p>

      <p>The bus was moving swiftly, but it was the morning peak hour and the roads were pretty congested.</p>

      <p>Two hours later, Teacher Wang, who was sitting at the front chewing on <em>latiao </em>, finally said, "Students, we are here. Everyone be ready to get off!"</p>

      <p>"Teacher, what time is it?"</p>

      <p>"It's four minutes past ten in the morning. We'll register at Number 59 High School first, then take part in the first exchange meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon to confirm the schedule for the next few days," Teacher Wang replied.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>After they got off the bus, the old bus driver slammed directly on the gas and sped away. Today, potato chips at the central supermarket were half-price; who knew whether he would be able to make it back in time to grab the last of it.</p>

      <p>They had gotten off on the other side of the road across from Number 59 High School.</p>

      <p>"We're here at last."</p>

      <p>Their slightly envious gazes swept over Number 59 High School's newly-renovated school grounds.</p>

      <p>At present, Number 59 High School was still just a candidate to become a key city high school, but the school environment and buildings, as well as teaching facilities, already fully met the standards for key city high schools.</p>

      <p>As far as the eye could see, there was greenery everywhere. Trees as lush as remote mountain forests grew in Number 59 High School's courtyard and lined the trail from the school gate to an eight-story teaching building which itself was surrounded by trees.</p>

      <p>Recalling the few frail old palms at Number 60 High School's entrance and the school's old buildings, this group of people instantly felt a little sad.</p>

      <p>"Damn! Is this really Number 59 High School?" Lin Xiaoyu was astonished. "I remember passing by here the year before last, and it had been even worse off than Number 60 High School! Did they strike gold?"</p>

      <p>"They probably did, the year before last." Chen Chao frowned and said, "That year, Number 59 High School produced six Golden Core students, which was the highest number recorded in the last two hundred years... so as early as the year before last, it received an angel investment from a private hospital. In the same year, they also successfully applied to the Education Department to be nominated as a candidate to become a key city high school."</p>

      <p>Teacher Wang nodded slightly. Chen Chao had already said whatever he had been about to say. The boy knew a little more compared with the other students, but that wasn't surprising. He had participated in many school sports competitions since he was a kid; he often visited other schools, so naturally he would know more compared with regular students.</p>

      <p>Lin Xiaoyu: "An angel investment from a hospital? Why a hospital?"</p>

      <p>"Furthermore, it's an all-male hospital. Have you heard of Nine Suns Men's Hospital? It was opened by the creator of the <em>Nine Suns Scriptures </em>!"</p>

      <p>For this type of gossip, in the end, it was Guo Hao who needed to step in. "This is the so-called 'In the flush of the spring wind the horse runs fast <sup>2</sup> , top scorers in the college exams are circumcised.'"</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a line from a poem titled 'After Passing the Exam' by Tang dynasty poet Meng Jiao.)</dfn>

      <p>Everyone: "..." A hospital targeted at college graduates, with advertising that was truly unlike any other <sup>3</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Circumcision supposedly enhances sex, so this would indeed be motivation to pass the college entrance examination ...)</dfn>

      <p>"I heard that guys with a graduation certificate from Number 59 High School can enjoy the circumcision service at this hospital free of charge. I wonder if I can borrow a certificate from here. When the time comes, maybe I should ask two other people to go with me?" Guo Hao asked, cupping his chin.</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ling felt that this was asking for too much!</p>

      <p>Both Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu's faces were completely red. It was inevitable that they would feel a little sensitive and embarrassed after listening to such embarrassing topics.</p>

      <p>"If Student Guo can borrow a graduation certificate, please take me with you!" Teacher Wang suddenly sighed. "It's coming up to six hundred years, and sadly I've never found the opportunity to let loose."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>On the side, Wang Ling once again refrained from saying anything.</p>

      <p>He knew what Teacher Wang's hand speed was like.</p>

      <p>Speaking rationally, he felt that there was no reason at all for Teacher Wang to visit the hospital â€” he could completely do it himself, with his own hand as a knife.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Though they were very envious of Number 59 High School's environment, no one was truly jealous. Once the funds from Huaguo Water Curtain Group came in, Number 60 High School's new environment would definitely be superior to this.</p>

      <p>Teacher Wang led the team to the school gate, where they were immediately stopped by the school guard, who was distracted by their bright blue uniforms. "Who're you looking for?"</p>

      <p>After Teacher Wang showed the school guard his papers, the man bowed deeply. "So it's Number 60 High School. Our school leader already let us know that you were coming; please proceed to room 1001 on the first floor in the teaching building for registration."</p>

      <p>"Alright, thank you." Teacher Wang took back his papers with a smile, eyes crinkling again in their trademark style.</p>

      <p>In this way, this group of people walked through the gate without any problems.</p>

      <p>To be honest, when it came to school inter-relationships, Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School had never been on very good terms. Teacher Wang hence found the school guard's respectful and friendly attitude somewhat unexpected.</p>

      <p>Of course, the observant Teacher Wang had also realized another issue, and that was the time of their arrival.</p>

      <p>He was willing to bet that Number 59 High School had made no school announcements whatsoever about it.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, given Student Sun Rong's influence, this tree-lined trail would have already been packed with people.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Usually, there would be a device in the school guard's office that would block out any probing spiritual senses, but these kind of gadgets were completely ineffective on Wang Ling. They hadn't even left the school gate very far behind before Wang Ling's spiritual senses had already directly penetrated the whole school. The school guard who had been smiling before already no longer had a smile on his face; instead, his expression was solemn as he made a call. "That's right, Director Xie, the people from Number 60 High School have arrived. Three male and two female students, and... a parrot? The teacher leading the team is a fatty. He looks like a fool and doesn't seem to be a threat."</p>

      <p>"Mm, I've already received information that he's a history teacher. Likely he doesn't have very much practical strength." A relatively cold voice sounded on the line.</p>

      <p>After saying this, Director Xie hung up the phone and patched through to the Student Union Office. She said gravely, "Little Tang, they have arrived. Make sure you follow the plan and take good care of them."</p>
