  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1239 Void Spirit Detection Reagent</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Today's Bai Zhe is indeed different from the past.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling can feel that Bai Zhe's combat effectiveness has been significantly improved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the only thing that hasn't changed is that excessive self-confidence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Excessive confidence is arrogance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is also the reason why Wang Ying initially took a fancy to Bai Zhe, but did not reuse Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he is strong, he can easily get into trouble if he is too conceited.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So now the question comes. How strong is Bai Zhe?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After testing in the Book of Sage Immortal, the exact answer was given: "My lord. He seems to have become an ethereal spirit."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Has it really been invaded by the void?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This result does not surprise Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because he clearly knows President Bai's hatred for him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to defeat him, he would rather not be a human being and let himself become a so-called higher-level creature...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Such hatred can be felt across the space Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is there any estimate of specific combat power?" Wang Ling asked the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is difficult to calculate. Because my knowledge of void creatures is still limited at present. However, the first thing Bai Zhe did after becoming a void spirit was to absorb the Demonic Gut Bacteria Master. This is the integration of the master's enlightenment power. creature. So currently, his strength may be higher than that of Wang Zhen in his heyday."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Above Venerated Immortal is Dao Supreme.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words, this person's current strength is indeed immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Wang Zhen came to him from the upper and lower realms of Jiuzhong Star to ask for an explanation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling is actually not scary.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He could tell at a glance that Wang Zhen was at his peak combat power. He could probably withstand five slaps from him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Heavenly Dao Committee punished Wang Zhen. In fact, it saved Wang Zhen's life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Otherwise, with these five slaps, Wang Zhen would have been out of his wits.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nowadays, President Bai, whose pseudonym is Xu Bai, is stronger than Wang Zhen. This made Wang Ling immediately interested.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His {Ten Slaps to Subdue the Dragon} that has been sealed away for many years. Will the seal be released?</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, preliminary test results have been obtained regarding the test of the red decoction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although there is a substance in this potion that Immortal Toya has never seen before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, through comparison of medicinal properties, Immortal Toya still found a spiritual plant with similar effects from the existing medicinal materials library on the earth. However, the effect is far not as good as that of brewing red decoction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">True Venerated Immortal Hall. Immortal Toya took a round, blue orb.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Create a projection by touching the magic ball. Project the picture in your mind into the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The first thing that can be determined is that the spiritual plant that makes the red soup does not exist on the earth. Let's call it a void plant." Immortal Toya said: "After reliable comparison, the medicinal properties of this void plant are similar to those of the earth." The herbal properties on Return are similar."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Return the grass?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Sun Yiyuan heard this, he nodded slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is engaged in the production of elixirs. Of course he is very sensitive to the names of some spiritual plants.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This return grass is a rare and endangered spiritual plant. It is also the main medicinal material used to make {Soul Recovery Pill}.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can bring back people's souls at critical moments and save people's lives.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is used for resuscitation of critically ill patients.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"As Mr. Keorn said. Hollows are advanced creatures."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It took them a long time to evolve themselves to the point where they were incorporeal, like light and wind."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"And invading the bodies of human cultivators actually causes great damage to themselves."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya said: "If Void Spirit is compared to a brand new software, then the environment for human cultivators is like an old system."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is no complete compatibility between the two."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So they need to take this supplement to adapt quickly."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi raised his eyebrows: "In other words, if they invade the human body, they will actually cause some harm to themselves?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya nodded: "Theoretically, this is true. But in fact, as long as they adapt to the human body, it will not affect the performance of their strength."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The only thing to note is that if the container they live in is not strong enough, it is likely to break."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"And they won't die. Then we just need to replace them with new containers."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"To put it simply, the process of adapting to the human body is the process in which they are at their weakest."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If we attack at this time, their strength cannot be effectively used. With our current combat power, there is still a high probability that we can win and remove them."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya introduces the relevant situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then he turned the magic ball in his hand and displayed a newly developed purple reagent: "This is the virtual spirit detection reagent I just prepared. It is prepared according to the medicinal properties of the return grass. It is colorless and odorless. Only those who have drunk the red decoction The ethereal spirit will react."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What's the reaction?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If you just rely on smelling it, people who are invaded by ethereal spirits will feel a sense of stench."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya said: "If the agent is injected into or comes into contact with the human body, within a very short period of time, the agent will cause the person invaded by the void spirit to lose their hair instantly and become bald..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Immortal Toya said this, everyone suddenly had a strong sense of seeing the scene in their minds.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just imagine. If virtual spirits completely broke out in the human world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If reagents are used for testing, then there may be scenes of people arresting bald heads all over the world...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nowadays, due to irregular life, even college students’ hair loss rate is increasing year by year.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Not to mention those high-risk occupations where you have to stay up late for a long time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Programmers, media professionals, medical staff, teachers, Internet authors...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Thinking of this. Zhuo Yi couldn't help shaking his body. He felt like his whole body was shaking.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What a reagent that makes people feel "bald"!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Well... we can't just beat people to death because of hair loss, right? There are still quite a lot of bald people nowadays." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Being beaten to death with a stick is definitely not enough."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya said: "So for those friends who have already lost their hair, the best way is to rely on smelling. As long as there is no nausea, they have no possibility of being invaded by ethereal spirits. At that time, you can get them a certificate or something like that. Something."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"But how could a person who was invaded by a virtual spirit accept and cooperate so easily?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I've thought about this too. So this matter must be done in a way that is both east and west."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Immortal Toya said: "Influenza is prevalent recently. Just say it's a flu test. I believe you won't refuse. If there is really no cooperation, you can put the reagent into artificial rainfall. Then just observe whether there is anyone on the street who has lost his hair after being exposed to the rain. Just people."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Sun Yiyuan sighed deeply and took off the wig on his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "Mr. Sun, you..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Yiyuan: "There is always a lot of pressure at work. In the past few years, I took hair growth pills every day. Now my body has developed resistance to the medicine. Later I gave up resistance."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone: "..."</p>
