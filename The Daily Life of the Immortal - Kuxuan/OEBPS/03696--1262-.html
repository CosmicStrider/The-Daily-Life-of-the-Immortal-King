  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1262 Mass Production of "Resurrection Coins"</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This matter first came from Guo Hao's mouth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He probably didn't know what information he got from one of his uncles. He was extremely worried about Sun Rong's current situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, the class group exploded unexpectedly without Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "What...what is this situation? Wasn't it fine before?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guo Hao: "Chen Chao. Stop talking. I'm scared."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Su Xiao: "It's strange. Yesterday, I reviewed the lecture notes for the recent class with classmate Sun. Her face looked very good. She didn't look like she was sick at all."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guo Hao: "I can't tell you the specific situation. My uncle said that last night, the Huaguo Shui Lian Group organized an expert consultation. All the famous doctors in Songhai City who were available were invited. There are also The doctor just stepped back from the epidemic prevention station. He rushed over as soon as he received the application."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is there any specific news? What kind of disease is it?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Class group. Everyone is worried.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They can't do anything else. With the financial resources of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group, I'm afraid they won't be short of money.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The only way to do it is to pray.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Guo Hao frowned and typed again: "Strange. That's the strange thing... It is said that more than a dozen experts have consulted, but they couldn't find out what the problem is with classmate Sun Rong! "</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The class group's speech made Wang Ling frown deeply.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After the Jiulong Mountain Competition, he visited Sun Rong as a representative.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He even quietly checked Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There were no obvious abnormalities throughout his body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is no curse of "yin and yang death" that Boss Sun is worried about.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now, as soon as the Void evacuated, a serious illness arose here at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The whole thing seems very fishy to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Now. Does the Son of the Void have a locked range?" Wang Ling asked the book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After he returned from the void world, the Book of Sage Immortal also obtained more data. The scope has been successfully reduced so far.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for the girls, as expected by Wang Ling, the identity of the Son of the Void was locked on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for the boys, there are currently two of them. The probabilities are evenly matched.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">One is Jiang Xiaoche, the secretary of Huaguo Shui Lian Group. The other is Yi Zhiyang, the adopted son of General Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The probability of both of them is currently 50%</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling thinks clearly. If Sun Rong's current illness is related to the Void Evacuation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Regardless of which one of these two people is the Son of the Void, one of them may be sick at the same time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the result was different from what Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">According to the findings of the Sage Immortal Book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Currently, Jiang Xiaoche is doing well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Yi Zhiyang is indeed in the hospital, the main purpose of his hospitalization is psychological counseling. He does not suffer from a life-threatening "serious illness" like Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is nothing we can do."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment. Wang Ling sighed slightly in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt that the whole story of the incident was not that simple.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong is sick. There is something fishy about it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The root cause must be traced back to the source.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Otherwise, even if Wang Ling casts a spell to save him, it will only take a moment and a half.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So before the results of the investigation come out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He could only help Sun Rong as long as possible.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, we are classmates.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moreover, this is also the effort of his hands.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then Wang Ling opened the cabinet on the side and prepared to draw the talisman paper by hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Come here and help."Wang Ling looked at Er Ha.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha walked over and turned into a human form. He started cutting the talisman paper according to the meaning of Wang Ling: "What talisman did you draw?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The scapegoat." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a Talisman with similar effects to the resurrection coin.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can be triggered at a critical moment to save someone's life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, if ordinary Taoist cultivators want to draw such a death talisman, in addition to consuming a huge amount of spiritual energy, they also have to spend decades or even hundreds of years of hard work... before they can develop one.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just draw it like this and go directly to mass production.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is only one Wang Ling in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His Little Master Ling is so unbelievable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If an ordinary person saw this scene, it would probably be terrifying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Er Ha is different.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because the shock operation brought to him by Wang Ling was too much. He was already numb.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A scapegoat drawn by Wang Ling himself. Its effectiveness is self-evident.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If Sun Rong is really fatally injured, this charm can not only enchant the soul, but also help Sun Rong recover from physical wounds.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In one morning, the spirits in the Wang family's villa were collectively mobilized.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Using limited materials, 3,000 death talismans were drawn.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's approaching noon.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These 3,000 death talismans have begun to take effect. Two of them have been burned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As Wang Ling expected. This disease is really weird.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Under normal circumstances, even if you have an incurable disease.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As long as there is a scapegoat drawn by Wang Ling, he will definitely survive.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is no need to use the second one at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling observed the burning time before and after these two death talismans. The interval was about 1 hour.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Will one be burned in an hour?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling frowned deeply.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was even more convinced.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is by no means a "disease".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But someone with intentions is cursing behind my back.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the person from this source is probably very cunning.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stayed at home for a while longer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was observing the consumption of the scapegoat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Around 2 p.m., bad news came again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling found that the burning speed of the scapegoat began to increase.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The previous interval was to consume one every hour. Now one has to be consumed every 50 minutes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from this growth rate, the consumption of death talismans will become faster and faster.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This was the purpose of his staying at home and observing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There can be a curse in this world. Can it be adapted to his death talisman?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This surprised Wang Ling inside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seems that for the time being, he can't get away to conduct a detailed investigation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This death talisman must be drawn by his own hands.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Otherwise, Sun Rong's life will not be saved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling quickly called Lord Diu Lei.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">One is to ask Lord Diu Lei to go to the hospital on his behalf to investigate the specific situation. He also has a King's Eyes in the hands of Lord Diu Lei. In this case, even if he does not go there in person, he may still be able to find clues.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The second thing is to ask the Office of Strategic Deception to support Talisman's production materials.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Draw a scapegoat. Although Wang Ling can be mass-produced, the material consumption is extremely huge.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling has exhausted all the inventory in his drawer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the raw materials he bought were the cheapest ones on the market...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are auxiliary resources from the Office of Strategic Deception. As the material level increases, the Talisman strength will naturally increase as well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Brother, do you want to leave my soul-soothing ring to classmate Sun Rong?" At the end of the communication, Lord Diu Lei suddenly asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No. It's useless." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although the soul-suppressing ring also has the effect of resurrection, it cannot be applied to the situation where the curse causes death.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To trigger the effect of the soul-suppressing ring, the body must suffer fatal injuries.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You might as well leave the ring to Sun Rong. Then send an executioner nearby. Seeing that Sun Rong is about to die, give Sun Rong a knife... and let Sun Rong be stabbed on the side. . while resurrecting.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is too cruel!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Will I eventually return to the void..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The call with Lord Diu Lei was completed. Wang Ling thought of what the Lord of the Void said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These words did not anger Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the contrary, it actually made him feel a little bit excited.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seemed that this was the Lord of the Void challenging him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is the first time in his life that a living being has doubted his ability.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Thinking that he has no ability to prevent the Son of the Void from returning to the Void World.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it is still unclear who will win.</p>
