  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Time goes back to about five minutes ago. A group of foreigners gathered outside the gate of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The leader is none other than Snake, the scavenger captain of the SBP Foundation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He arrived at the location designated by Xu Bai in less than 2 hours and obtained a magic weapon known as the "Void Magic Ball".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then came here according to new instructions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Snake didn't know what this Lord "Judgement" was going to do. But it was definitely right to follow the Foundation's arrangements.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A group of outsiders gathered in front of the mountain gate. This was definitely a sign of danger. Upon seeing this, the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception quickly reported the situation to the deeper level. Soon, a golden stream of light rose from the hinterland of the Office of Strategic Deception. It fell from the sky and landed on In front of these scavengers.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The powerful aura made several scavengers step back unconsciously.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Snake stared at the young boy in front of him with his dark blue eyes embedded in the deeply sunken eye sockets: "We are here under the orders of the SBP Foundation. Please come out and hand the person in charge of your sect back. we!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After saying this, Snake was also recalling the origin of the person in front of him in his mind. As a result, he found that he had no memory at all...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Crispy Noodles didn't reply. He just looked at Snake quietly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The rules of the Office of Strategic Deception. Whenever encountering a provocateur at Shanmen, the Office of Strategic Deception will never make the first move.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Seeing the young man standing motionless, Snake looked a little impatient: "You're not going to ask the person in charge to come out. Or are you the person in charge here?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm just a security guard." Crispy noodles answered honestly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, he works in multiple departments of the Office of Strategic Deception. He is a serious "fill-in player". He will go wherever he is needed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Today, his identity is in charge of security. Tomorrow, he may become the coach of his disciples, guiding them in their practice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the "small account" under Wang Ling. Although Crispy Noodles is just a real clone, it unexpectedly gives people a sense of reliability and peace of mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The disciples on the sentry tower were relieved when they saw Crispy Noodles arriving. Almost all the disciples in the Office of Strategic Deception knew how strong Elder Crispy Noodles was.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mr. Security Guard, you Office of Strategic Deception stole our people. They should be returned to us. If you persist in your persistence, we will have no choice but to snatch them away." Snake threatened.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Crispy Noodles sighed inwardly. He lamented that the foreigners in front of him talked so much nonsense and seemed to have a bad word count. Instead, he looked forward to Snake taking action faster.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Until... he saw Liu Gang speeding towards the horizon...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I see. It's all God's will." The young man raised his head and stared through the layers of clouds at the ray of light speeding towards the sky thousands of miles high.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He suddenly understood who had taken action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is only one person in the entire universe who can achieve such finger power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The strongest person is about to be eliminated. I'm afraid this fight will be meaningless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The young man sighed in disappointment and turned around to return to the sect.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As soon as he took a step forward, Snake reached out and held his shoulder: "Want to leave? It's not that easy!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The domineering spiritual power was transmitted through Snake's body like electricity. The young man's body paused. Then he ignored the pressure and continued to move forward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Snake was furious. Although he had heard that since the rise of the Office of Strategic Deception, the disciples there were becoming more arrogant than the other. But why is even a security guard so awesome?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's too much to bully someone..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, Snake roared loudly. His size began to double at a speed visible to the naked eye! It skyrocketed into a steel giant that was ten meters tall. This is the {Metal Steel Multiplication Technique}. A method to develop the potential of the physical body. The ultimate magic!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A huge shadow covered the sky, completely blocking the sunlight above our heads...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"As expected of Little Master Ling. Did you even capture the situation after the doubling..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Crispy Face's expression was indifferent. He continued to step forward calmly. Previously, he saw that the flying "Senluo Wanxiang Pillar" actually had a trajectory error of several meters.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words, if Snake had not used this doubling technique, he could have avoided this disaster.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But now. This is almost a doomed situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next second.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Under the watchful eyes of everyone, a needle flew from the sky. It hit Snake in the back of the head with a pop, and passed directly through the entire head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">No blood from one shot!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the moment it passed through, all of Snake's brain tissue was disintegrated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The huge body suddenly fell from the mountain gate. Then the skyrocketing size also gradually shrank.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Crispy Noodles didn't even look back because this was an expected situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, the group of scavengers in front of the mountain gate were all stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Captain..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They were not in a hurry for revenge. Instead, they immediately gathered around and took out various emergency magic weapons to rescue Snake.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When the scanner scanned Snake's brain, one team member was so shocked that he could not speak. Because according to the scan results, Snake's skull was completely hollow.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The entire brain was completely incinerated by the overflowing energy the moment the flying needle passed through it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Brain dead. There is no way to save him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Several scavengers made quick judgments.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Someone tried to take revenge, but was intercepted by another person. This was the scavenger's deputy team. His name was Kaz: "The entire security guard...killed our captain without even looking back. What you did is just too much. Just give me a head."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The people in the Office of Strategic Deception are terrifyingly strong. Even scarier than the rumors say.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The situation in front of him was beyond Kaz's understanding.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What method did he use?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No. I didn't see it at all. It seemed like a magic weapon. It came from a distance."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's so scary. He didn't even raise his hand. Is it a magic weapon controlled by his mind?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"At the very least, it's an upper-level holy weapon... No. It might be the opposite world level!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"He didn't even have any spiritual power fluctuations just now. He didn't even consume spiritual power to drive the opponent's world-level magic weapon?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Several scavengers discussed this point. Everyone felt chills running down their spines and hair standing on end.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's better not to act rashly for now. Let's report the situation to the Lord Judge first." Kaz frowned. He immediately directed everyone to take Snake's body and quickly leave the mountain gate of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They also have a void magic ball given by Lord "Judgement". But so far, they don't know what this magic ball does.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the group of foreigners left, the disciples on guard duty in the guard tower also raised the danger alarm. The entire Office of Strategic Deception was filled with joy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Have you seen it? Elder Crispy Noodles... is too strong!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I saw it! It seemed to be a magic weapon driven by thoughts. It directly killed the troublemaking captain."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is that foreigner really dead?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"They should be dead. Look at the way the remaining group of people are running around with their heads in their hands. They are obviously frightened! Look at Elder Crispy Noodles again. He looks calm and calm. He didn't even raise his hand during the whole process. . There wasn’t even any psychic energy fluctuations overflowing. And when the figure of the foreigner headed by him suddenly grew in size! Elder Crispy Noodles actually chose to turn back!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It seems that Elder Crispy Noodles has already concluded that this person will definitely die, so he turned back, right?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"A real man! He never looks behind him!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These remarks made Crisp Mian smile bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he is a "fill-in player", he didn't expect that he would also have to make up for the "back-up position"...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Isn’t this taking away Zhuo Yi’s job?</p>
