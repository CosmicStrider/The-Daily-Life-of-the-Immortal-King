  <h1>Chapter 34 The Ongoing Might of Sun Rong's Domain </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>According to the student union's typical arrangement at Number 59 High School, after Tang Jingze's speech, a representative from among the invited guests would wrap up the meeting in the final segment.</p>

      <p>But actually, none of them had been able to clearly hear what Tang Jingze had said...</p>

      <p>Because before the allotted hour was up, this exchange meeting had already been out of control for fifty minutes, leaving him only five minutes to speak. Furthermore, it wasn't five minutes of solemn silence, but filled with the drone of voices, like the incessant buzzing of a fly around his ear.</p>

      <p>Had it been a usual meeting, Tang Jingze would have blown up much earlier on. But now, in the presence of people from another school, he had to bear the humiliation and swallow his anger in order to preserve his dignity as the president of the student union.</p>

      <p>With five minutes left to the end of the meeting, Tang Jingze looked at his watch, only to find that he hadn't even gotten through a thirtieth of his meticulously planned speech!</p>

      <p>Gritting his teeth, he looked at Sun Rong. "Then, let us invite the representative of Number 60 High School, Classmate Sun Rong, to say a few words."</p>

      <p>Thunderous applause filled the classroom.</p>

      <p>Knowing that it was Sun Rong's turn to speak, the hot-blooded boys of Number 59 High School quickly quietened down after gallantly clapping for her.</p>

      <p>It was silent enough to hear a pin drop...</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze was so infuriated he almost spit up blood... he had spent fifty minutes struggling to contain the situation, but lost out to the name "Sun Rong"! ...Fuck!</p>

      <p>He stood up and moved a few steps to the side, promptly pressing a button to broadcast Sun Rong's voice to every corner of the school. Every single time she became tongue-tied would be recorded and later used as the butt of watercooler jokes.</p>

      <p><em>Heh, there's still five minutes left! Let's see what rubbish sentiment you can pull out!</em></p>

      <p>Sun Rong calmly walked onto the dais and flipped her hair back. Even at that distance, Wang Ling could detect a whiff of fragrance.</p>

      <p>She bowed slightly to the students below her with full confidence, then sat down with easy grace in the seat which Tang Jingze had vacated. Adjusting her tone, she said softly, "Hello everyone, I am the Vice President of the Student Union at Number 60 High School and class monitor of Grade One, Class Three, Sun Rong."</p>

      <p>This was completely unlike her usual tone; she had clearly been trained! A gentle and sweet voice mixed with a faint broadcasting style, the movements of her lips and teeth, every frown and every smile... it was only the opening remarks, but the audience was already silently enveloped in her voice.</p>

      <p>It wasn't just the students of Number 59 High School; even Wang Ling and the others froze for a second.</p>

      <p>"I never expected Classmate Sun Rong's voice to be so beautiful when she gets serious."</p>

      <p>"She deserves to be the Nation's School Beauty, this is just like a voice actor!"</p>

      <p>Below the dais, the students from Number 59 High School started to whisper to one another.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong smiled faintly and continued, "It is an honor for our Number 60 High School delegation to be invited to the student exchange meet at Number 59 High School. In the last fifty minutes, Classmate Tang Jingze has set us a good example as the President of the Student Union at Number 59 High School..."</p>

      <p>The corners of Tang Jingze and Fang Huaqing's mouths pulled down in spite of themselves — this was laying it on too thick!</p>

      <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao, and Lin Xiaoyu already couldn't help sniggering.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling still tried to maintain a straight face. He had to admit, though... Sun Rong's voice when she was being serious was indeed nice to listen to.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong wasn't in a hurry as she spoke in a pleasant and captivating manner. "Both sides have engaged in friendly conversation in meetings. We've exchanged opinions and enhanced mutual understanding. The talks were beneficial, and I believe we did our Number 60 High School proud. Likewise, we also respect Number 59 High School's views and admire Classmate Tang Jingze's contribution toward safeguarding the school environment."</p>

      <p>Outside the teaching building, Teacher Wang couldn't help snickering as he heard the broadcast, eyes crinkling into thin slits.</p>

      <p>After all, she was the successor nurtured by Huaguo Water Curtain Group. Her deadpan and indirect approach in ruthlessly criticizing Number 59 High School was too brilliant!</p>

      <p>Sun Rong had indeed been trained in broadcasting, which was a compulsory component of Huaguo Water Curtain Group's family business management matters. She had been educated in these types of business management areas from a very young age.</p>

      <p>She had already received a national language certificate from Huaxiu nation in relation to the field of broadcasting. Not only did she have a sweet voice and even pacing, she was also able to adapt quickly to any situation. Tang Jingze had wanted to make things difficult for Sun Rong here, but he was obviously nothing compared with her.</p>

      <p>Every skilled broadcaster had a stopwatch in their minds, and could increase or decrease their pacing by precisely calculating the time.</p>

      <p>Of course, it was the same for Sun Rong.</p>

      <p>Estimating that she had less than thirty seconds left, Sun Rong smiled faintly and started to wind up. "Meanwhile, we are deeply sorry for Number 59 High School's loss of twelve spirit gathering arrays in a day...</p>

      <p>"I hope that in the future, there will be more interaction between our two schools to enhance our friendship and to make greater contributions toward the mutual and harmonious development of our students!!"</p>

      <p><em>Dinglingling </em>! — The dismissal bell rang, signaling the end of the third class in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong had spoken for exactly five minutes, not a minute more and not a minute less.</p>

      <p>"Thank you everyone!" She released a sigh, straightened her back and gave another bow. Each action was so perfect that no one could find fault with any of them.</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze then heard vigorous applause <em>papapapa </em>resound throughout the classroom. Even teachers in the office listening to the broadcast couldn't help clapping. Even if they had no idea what was happening at the meeting venue, everyone who heard Sun Rong's speech would assume that this exchange meeting had been a great success!</p>

      <p>In the meeting venue, almost all the boys stood up to cheer and clap for her.</p>

      <p>"Although I don't know what Classmate Sun Rong was talking about, it was still so cool!"</p>

      <p>"Damn! In comparison, our president was Runtu <sup>1</sup> !"</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Runtu is a character in the Chinese novel 'My Old Home' by well-known writer Luxun. The story is told in the first-person, and tells of how the protagonist returns from the city to the countryside where he grew up, and of the sharp contrasts between him and
his childhood friend, country boy Runtu, after so many years.)</dfn>

      <p>"Goddess Sun Rong has such a beautiful voice! Why the heck did they give so much time to Tang Jingze that guy, that was just a waste of life! I strongly beg the goddess to come back for meetings at Number 59 High School!"</p>

      <p>This was the might of the ongoing impact of Sun Rong's domain...</p>

      <p>Once it started to take effect, it could influence ninety-five percent of the people within its range.</p>

      <p>Although not everyone bought into Sun Rong's impact, Wang Ling felt that in some sense, this ability to "devour" both women and men was beyond even cultivation realms, it was too powerful.</p>

      <p>On one side, with Sun Rong at its center, the room was bright and clear.</p>

      <p>On the other side, dark clouds hung over the heads of Tang Jingze and the others...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt that those faces could not get any blacker — they were just like stale pork liver that had been further stamped upon by dirty, wet galoshes.</p>

      <p>It was his own school and he was the president of the student union, yet Tang Jingze had been humiliated in his own territory by people from another school.</p>

      <p>He ground his teeth in hatred. No matter what, he would surely pay the people from Number 60 High School back double for the game which he had lost today.</p>

      <p>After all, this was just the first day!</p>

      <p>There were still three more days to go...</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze still refused to admit defeat.</p>
