  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tomorrow is Monday. But Wang Ling doesn't have to go to school.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen comprehensively considered the situation of the delegation and gave the delegation two days of rest. After all, they came back to bring glory to the school. Some people have not fully recovered. If they return to study seamlessly, it will only cause more trouble. A lot of pressure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Therefore, on Monday and Tuesday, members of the 60 delegation can complete their homework at home. Each teacher will record the video of the class and send it to the class group for the students of the delegation to study at home.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To Wang Ling's surprise, Father Wang did not blame him for the composition when he got home. Instead, he smiled broadly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This makes Wang Ling a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What are you afraid of? Sit down. I won't deduct your pocket money." Father Wang patted the empty seat next to the sofa.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You wrote a good composition." Then he began to praise Wang Ling: "This shows that you still have the genes of our Old Wang family."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"..."Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't worry. Dad doesn't blame you for this. You just have to be successful. Compositions are sometimes a matter of inspiration. I'm afraid you can't control this well." Father Wang stared at Wang Ling. tutted. Then he reached out and touched Wang Ling's shoulder: "Through this competition, I got to know you better. Son!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling still didn't dare to speak. Mainly because he felt that there seemed to be a deeper meaning in Father Wang's words.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"In the future, you can also learn to inherit my mantle. If you are not busy, you might as well help me code. You will share 10% of the manuscript fee. My 10% of the manuscript fee is more than your pocket money. !"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang LingI didn’t expect Father Wang to make such a request.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Isn’t this just looking for hot spots!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moreover, he specializes in the field of science. He really has never thought about writing a book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After being stunned for a moment, Father Wang chuckled and touched Wang Ling's head: "I'm just kidding. I'm just testing you. I still have some professional ethics. Your writing is like an exam essay. I still look down on my father's skills."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling felt another lament in his heart. He was being teased outside and being teased by his father at home. This life is really unbearable!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After dinner, Lord Diu Lei had a phone call with Wang Ling. They mainly discussed the settlement issues of Li Huanran and Jiang Yingyue.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Huanran will attend a public hearing later as the main witness of this incident. Jiang Yingyue has some clues about the fake Ghost Ax Spirit Mother, so it also has a certain value.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The call Lord Diu Lei made was actually not to Wang Ling. It was to Er Ha.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Brother Ling, the current situation is like this. The Office of Strategic Deception needs to assist Huaxiu Alliance in handling follow-up matters. It cannot spare manpower for the time being. Huaxiu Alliance believes that it is necessary to find suitable people to keep an eye on these two... Li Nothing will happen to Huanran. The main problem is Jiang Yingyue. It would be bad if something happens." Lord Diu Lei expressed his concerns.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the "Office of Strategic Deception" he talks about is actually the "Office of Strategic Deception".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a new pseudonym recently established by the War Ignorance Bureau. It is convenient to call and more domineering.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the current busy stage where everything needs to be connected, who comes to see Jiang Yingyue seems to have become a problem.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So Lord Diu Lei's idea was to let Li Huanran and Jiang Yingyue live in Wei Zhi's house...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hearing these words made Wang Ling sweat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi already live in Wei Zhi's house. Two more people will be crammed in. And they are a boy and a girl. Is this going to be a romantic comedy...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, this suggestion is not impossible.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">First of all, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi are their own people. Their main job is to take care of the spiritual beasts in Wei Zhi's villa. After Li Huanran and Jiang Yingyue moved in, not only did they have a temporary place to stay, but the key is Some people watched it too.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Liu Qingyi is a very considerate person. As long as she is around, Jiang Yingyue is unlikely to do anything wrong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In addition, the director of the neighborhood committee of the apartment is Martial Saint Marshal Jiang, one of the ten founding generals who retired at home.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With Martial Saint here, Jiang Yingyue is probably even more afraid to move. It is more effective than being sent to prison to be guarded. So, this is indeed a feasible plan.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moreover, Wei Zhi's apartment is big enough. It can accommodate more than a dozen spiritual beasts, let alone two more people.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in the final analysis, this matter still has to be approved by Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The whole story was revealed. Er Ha, who had been squatting nearby and listening for a long time, finally understood. Diu Lei's call was said to be to Wang Ling. In fact, it was to him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone knows that the friendship between Er Ha and Wei Zhi is pretty good. It can be regarded as one of the few friends Er Ha has had during his practice on earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha replied: "It's not difficult. I just say hello to him."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Thank you, Brother Dog!" Lord Diu Lei showed a cheerful smile.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Also, is the matter of the fake Ghost Ax Spirit Mother already under investigation?" At this time, Er Ha asked with concern.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Well. We have already made arrangements based on the clues provided by Jiang Yingyue. There should be news in the future."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, the call is interrupted.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling thought that he could finally rest. As a result, a series of messages came out in their "Sixty Delegation (2)" WeChat discussion group.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Why is it "(2)". That's because there is no Sun Rong in the member.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This group, including these messages, was generated when he was on the phone with Lord Diu Lei just now.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Someone formed a new group chat, leaving all the teachers and Sun Rong out. It seemed like they were planning something secretly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling scrolled up the chat history and glanced several times. Only then did he realize that everyone was discussing about visiting Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "Have you heard about it? What hospital?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guo Hao: "My uncle replied to me. Songhai City Qixing First Military Medical Hospital."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xia Ming sighed: "As expected of my classmate Sun Rong! This hospital is not easy to enter... Then here comes the question. Who of us is free to visit classmate Sun Rong tomorrow? Let's talk about it first. I really want to I'm going. But the problem is that after I get back from the game, my mom wants to take me out for a walk."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "Walking?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xia Ming: "Our school finally won the first place. I am still one of the representatives. Can't I go out to visit my relatives and show off?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guo Hao: "I'm about the same..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "+1!!!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Youyue: "Me too! Speaking of which, I also helped my classmate Sun Rong make a nutritional lunch. It can speed up recovery! Who is free tomorrow?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Seeing this, Wang Ling finally couldn't bear it anymore. He felt that if he didn't speak, this matter would most likely happen to him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, Chen Chao suddenly said: "Let's do it. Now, for those who are silent, we will form a group to see Sun Rong tomorrow!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As soon as he finished speaking, Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Zhenyuan, and Gu Shunzhi sent a series of smiling faces.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The ellipsis of Wang Ling has not been sent out yet. These people have already sent it out before him!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These people are all peeking at the screen!!!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao: "Then Wang Ling. It's up to you to go tomorrow. Don't pretend. I know you are also peeking at the screen. Our condolences will be integrated tomorrow and will be delivered to your home at noon! You can give them to your grandson on our behalf. Classmates will send it over."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>
