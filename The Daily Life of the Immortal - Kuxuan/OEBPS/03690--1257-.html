  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1257 That man is here!</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In a sense, Zhuo Yi feels that President Bai is a "lifelong enemy" to his master Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this life-long enemy is more miserable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Almost every time in his life, he was beaten to death with just a few slaps.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi didn’t know President Bai appeared in front of him at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">How many palm strikes can I take from my master?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He stared at the resurrected young man in front of him. He was wearing a noble coat with red moon patterns on a black background. A pure black belt tightly bound the young man's slender waist. He looked taller and taller. Every move and every move was full of energy. It has the taste of Western aristocracy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Before being invaded by President Bai, this young man's name was "Michelle". He was the owner of the Dark Night Castle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can be seen that although President Bai became a virtual spirit and invaded Michelle, he did not abandon Michelle's original elegant and noble temperament.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, he held his cane, stared in the direction of Zhuo Yi and sneered: "The former Michelle no longer exists. The former President Bai has also disappeared. The one standing in front of you now . It’s a brand new me. My name is Xu Bai.”</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">An elegant yet magnetic male voice came.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xu Bai did not speak.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi was surprised that this voice sounded directly from his mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Have you felt it? This is the power that exists as a high-level life form. I am all things. And all things are also me. This is a power that resonates with all things... Only ethereal spirits without entities can easily do it. "Xu Bai spoke calmly. Even if Jing Bai was present, he was completely fearless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was as if he was truly invincible.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I found that the people in your foundation all have one characteristic, that is, they are very conceited." Zhuo Yi looked at Xu Bai. At the same time, he was also carefully sensing the young man's combat power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Indeed. The Xu Bai in front of him seemed to have a completely different flavor from the void creatures he had fought against.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is different from Snake. It is also different from the aura attached to the Silver God Great Sword by the ethereal spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The fusion of Xubai can almost be described as perfect. The whole body fits perfectly. There is not a single flaw.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi. Maybe you've felt it."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xu Bai smiled slightly and said: "You shouldn't associate me with Snake and Chariot Naya's trash... One of them has just evolved. The fusion is not perfect. The other one is He regards the virtual spirit as his own tool. He does not realize the meaning of becoming a higher-level creature."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Snake. But he was destroyed by my sword. How many swords do you think you can survive?" Zhuo Yi also laughed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He really didn't know the reason why Xu Bai was so confident.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although. This man does seem to be different from the void creatures he has seen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But no matter how strong Xu Bai is, can he still be stronger than Lord Jingbai?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi felt that even if his master Wang Ling didn't take action, Xu Bai would not be able to withstand the power of Jing Bai's sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I know. Maybe you still don't understand what I'm talking about. But strength will prove everything in the end."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xubai is extremely confident.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is different from Snake's ethereal spirit, which is formed by the sphere of void magic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is an existence that directly accepted the baptism of the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xu Bai turned the golden cane in his hand. The scenery within the entire Number 60 High School suddenly changed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The school square that Zhuo Yi stepped on suddenly turned into quicksand. It suddenly softened and collapsed!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The huge square of Number 60 High School turned into a bottomless black hole in space in an instant!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, the surrounding space suddenly fell into a state of weightlessness, causing Zhuo Yi's body to float involuntarily along with the endless gravel around him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is another ability of void creatures. It is called. Void Limit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is similar to the existence of the inherent spiritual realm among cultivators on earth. In just a blink of an eye, Zhuo Yi was trapped by Xubai and fell into the boundary of the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xu Bai was holding his cane and standing in the center of this endless abyss.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is like the conductor of a carnival symphony, enjoying the pleasure brought by the power of the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This scene is like the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Underground is a bottomless abyss of void. Above the head is a vortex of void that can swallow everything. Zhuo Yi's body was torn apart by two forces at the same time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt that his body had been divided into two parts. It no longer belonged to him at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If it weren't for the frightened sword energy protecting his body, he would have turned into two lumps of flesh long ago.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi's complexion changed. The sweat flowing down from his temples was sucked away by the void vortex above his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had no choice but to draw his sword and strike at Xu Bai.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The mighty sword spirit!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The moment Jingbai was swung out, it was torn apart by the upper and lower forces.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Before he even got close to his body, it was completely dissipated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi. Now do you know why I am not afraid of your sword."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xu Bai sighed: "Now that I have entered the realm of my void, I can only decide everything."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hearing this, Shi Bai's expression changed slightly. Such a situation was extremely rare for him, the master of the sword spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is a way to limit this void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If Jingbai’s calculation is correct.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is something similar to "disarming" power here.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Not just for spirit swords. The power of all magic weapons will be perfectly broken down by the upper and lower forces here.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"All this time. I've been looking for reasons for my failure."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xu Bai, who was standing in the center of the void boundary, said calmly: "After countless deductions, I think the only reason for my defeat is the magic weapon..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xu Bai: "Thank you Lord for giving me such a great ability. All the magical weapons of time have no effect on me. Wang Ling has been able to run rampant in the world for so many years. It is nothing more than having that weird weapon in my hand. The Taomu Sword, including those slaps he slapped me with, must have been fused with the power of the Taomu Sword."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "So... you put this all down to the gap between equipment?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xu Bai: "Isn't that true? If you are not superior to me in magical weapons, how can you defeat me?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi, Jingbai sighed secretly: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seems that this person has died several times. His IQ has not improved at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a flaw.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">No matter how many times you do sit-ups on the coffin board, it's impossible to improve.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was stunned and silent. The next moment he turned around and transformed into a sword again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In his opinion, such an idiot is completely hopeless. One more glance would risk losing his mind. Therefore, Jingbai cannot avoid it. He has no intention of continuing to pay attention to Xubai's boring delusions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although the sword energy was swallowed up, he still had many ways to kill Xu Bai.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't, Master Jingbai... What will I do if you leave!" Zhuo Yi exclaimed in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Haven't you noticed yet? Your master is already here..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, a shocked voice sounded in Zhuo Yi's mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Zhuo Yi came to his senses, a warm hand suddenly placed on his shoulder.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That man is here...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That man. Just finished his homework. Here he comes!</p>
