  <h1>Chapter 69 Back Then on Mount Wuqing and Malan Hill... </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Tang Jingze knew that no one from Number 60 High School was carrying teleport, and normally the speed it took to get from the top and mid lanes to the bot lane was at the very least two damn minutes! This speed was a little too ridiculously fast!</p>

      <p>Seeing the three people suddenly spring out of the grass, all the leaders on the stage were also baffled.</p>

      <p>This support speed was really too scary...</p>

      <p>"Why are they here?" Fang Huaqing stood on the edge of the turret's attack range, clutching his blank sword with trembling hands.</p>

      <p>"They bought shoes!"</p>

      <p>"Shoes? No matter how quickly they speed up movement, it can't be to this extent, right?"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze quickly opened the inventory list and what he saw almost brought him to his knees!</p>

      <p>[Name: Reporter's Boots]</p>

      <p>[Type: Functional Magic Weapon]</p>

      <p>[Quality: Excellent]</p>

      <p>[Gold Coins: 600]</p>

      <p>[Description: A pair of running shoes personally created by the Mo family with a customized design to commemorate reporter comrades. Put on this pair of shoes and you'll be able to break human limits and run fast to reach teammates who need support. This pair of shoes expresses our best regards to the reporters who all these years have been constantly dashing around the world in search of big news.]</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Looking at the broadcast image, the audience couldn't help but be lost in deep thought for a while.</p>

      <p>A breeze blew through the reeds in Cultivator's Rift, stirring up a chill in the heart...</p>

      <p>Seeing that Sun Rong, Chen Chao and Lin Xiaoyu had already emerged one after another from behind the tower with the aim of surrounding and attacking them on all sides, Tang Jingze simply wanted to break the blank sword in his hand. "..." What the fuck could they do now?!</p>

      <p>Seeing that the situation had changed, some little fatty who had initially been hiding in the turret also walked unhurriedly out to greet Tang Jingze. "Yo~ big brother! We meet again! Who could have expected this feng shui... it's just like a big windmill turning!"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao stuck out his belly as he jumped out from the turret. "Hit me!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "..."</p>

      <p>"You can't lift a finger!"</p>

      <p>Saying that, Guo Hao jumped back to the turret. Then he jumped out again. "Curse me!"</p>

      <p>"..." Tang Jingze gnashed his teeth.</p>

      <p>"You can't open your mouth!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Everyone from Number 60 High School were already used to this. In any case, it wasn't like this guy only started to have a rotten mouth in the last day or two. The most irritating, however, was when he was being a rotten mouth and you had no way to deal with him!</p>

      <p>"Big brothers, let's take it easy... can't you restrain yourselves?" Tang Jingze was well aware that if they were beaten back and defeated here, their chances at victory would be very slim.</p>

      <p>"Sorry, brother... our rule is, if you can do it, stop yammering about it!" Guo Hao threw back what Tang Jingze had said to him before, word for word, and then Chen Chao shouted, "Go, you —!" before kicking the five people from Number 59 High School into the turret's attack range.</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze rubbed his butt, his face shaking... fuck! This rotten mouth birdman was a Scorpio! — Hold a grudge!</p>

      <p>And then, there was no more 'and then'...</p>

      <p>Given the disparity in items, plus their position in the turret's attack range, these guys from Number 59 High School completely lacked any strength to fight back.</p>

      <p>"First kill!"</p>

      <p>"Double kill!"</p>

      <p>"Triple kill!"</p>

      <p>"Quadra kill!"</p>

      <p>"Penta kill!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>There was a ringing sound from the system in no time and a huge "ACE" hung high in the middle of the large broadcast screen.</p>

      <p>The female host screamed excitedly, "ACE! Student Chen Chao's move worked! Students Guo Hao and Wang Ling's trap was very successful! Student Sun Rong has achieved a Penta kill! Penta kill! At this moment, Student Sun Rong raises her great magic sword high, as if she has been possessed by its spirit! At this moment, she represents the fine traditions of Number 60 High School... she's not fighting alone! She's not alone!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>The students of Number 59 High School facepalmed in unison.</p>

      <p>Fuck! — This was a home battle! Too disgraceful, hey!</p>

      <p>Director Xie sighed. "They have already done very well, but it's very clear that the students of Number 60 High School are more flexible in their use of magic weapons. This means they are very resourceful. Furthermore, the most important thing is that these kids unexpectedly know how to use advanced military tactics such as a ball <sup>1</sup> ."</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A ball formation is a number of units moving together as one group.)</dfn>

      <p>Headmaster Chen: "Director Xie, you have actually studied team tactics?"</p>

      <p>"This is from Grandmaster Ye Shen's Guide to Glory , I'm just applying what I learned." Director Xie smiled shyly and gave Teacher Wang a look as gentle as water. "Mr Wang is the true expert!"</p>

      <p>Teacher Wang smiled bashfully. "Darling, you flatter me, I'm just an amateur."</p>

      <p>Headmaster Chen, Headmaster Jin and Director Shi: "..." You this couple, enough already!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Thirty-eight minutes into the competition, the income gap in the field had reached nearly ten thousand... each person from Number 60 High School had as many as four to five items, and with just a little bit more income, they would be able to build the great magic swords in their hands into spirit swords.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, in consideration of both schools' influential positions, and so that Number 59 High School wouldn't fail too badly, Sun Rong, Guo Hao and Chen Chao all ran out to feed <sup>2</sup> them out of friendship. But even so, the gap in the number of kills couldn't be closed...</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Feeding the enemy team is to be killed by them on purpose.)</dfn>

      <p>Twelve kills to three... victory and defeat in this battle had already been clearly decided.</p>

      <p>On the stage, Headmaster Jin's expression was very grim. This was a showdown between two teams of school elites; in such a team battle, given this income disparity, unless a miracle happened, it was impossible to turn things around even if they gained some advantage...</p>

      <p>Headmaster Jin heaved a deep sigh. "Ai, we've lost..."</p>

      <p>The relationship between Headmaster Chen and Headmaster Jin was the same as that between Director Shi and Director Xie — they had been old foes for many years. Zhuo Yi was well aware of how things stood between the two men, who back then had both graduated from Seven Stars Sect.</p>

      <p>Seeing Headmaster Jin sigh, Headmaster Chen, who had been his senior at university, also had somewhat complicated feelings that were neither happy nor sad, and he immediately comforted him telepathically. "Junior brother... it doesn't matter, the most important thing is participation. Friendship first, competition second!"</p>

      <p>"Senior brother, remember when we crossed swords back then on Mount Wuqing and Malan Hill? I lost to you. This time, it's a battle between our students. Who knew I would lose to you again... ai, this has to be fate."</p>

      <p>"This is just a game. There are always unpredictable factors in a team battle. This group of children from Number 59 High School never gave up to the end. This refusal to admit defeat is a bit like you..."</p>

      <p>"The students from Number 60 High School are not bad either. They adapt very well and are very flexible. This cunning and astuteness... is the same as senior brother's..."</p>

      <p>"Haha, junior brother, you flatter me!"</p>

      <p>"...Senior brother, can we discuss something?"</p>

      <p>"Speak."</p>

      <p>"Have some of your students feed me again?"</p>

      <p>"Dream on, junior brother! Do you want our spirit sword education to fail the way our national soccer team did?"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"Then, senior brother, I have another question."</p>

      <p>"Speak."</p>

      <p>"Why, why are there no spirit swords used in a spirit sword exchange meet?"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>
