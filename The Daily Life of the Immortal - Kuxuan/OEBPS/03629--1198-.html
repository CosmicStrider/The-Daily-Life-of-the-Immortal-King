  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1198 Behind the Void Gate</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Wang Ying relied on the characteristics of shadow to imitate all his abilities, his personality was fundamentally different from Wang Ling. What made Wang Ling feel the most about Wang Ying was that he didn't know how to deal with it. Where does confidence come from.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Being too confident in one's own strength often puts oneself into unknown predicaments.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But as his own shadow, although 100% of his power is not enough in the eyes of Wang Ling, it is still stronger than most people on the earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying thought that his sword pressure had firmly suppressed Wang Ling. His body immediately began to transform, trying to wrap up and devour Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The huge black shadow is like a black hole. It turns into ferocious minions and devours Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ying still didn't realize that her situation was already bad.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">During the battle, Wang Ying had always kept a complete distance from Wang Ling in order to prevent Wang Ling from finding any chance to get close. He knew Wang Ling too well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If you get close...Wang Ling, it may be easier to find the opportunity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the swallowing black shadow rushed from a distance and pounced on Wang Ling. Wang Ying was secretly surprised. He saw that Wang Ling even opened his eyelids under the pressure of his huge sword. It won't open.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in fact. Wang Ling closed his eyes mainly because he was accumulating strength.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The universe is so huge. In the previous two duels, Wang Ling reorganized his spells and used long-range strikes. The main purpose was because Wang Ying had maintained a cautious heart before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, during the previous battle, he came up with an excellent way to regain Wang Ying... but because of the distance, he had to lure Wang Ying into his effective attack range.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And when the endless black shadow turned into a round black hole and swallowed him, Wang Ling realized that his best chance to take action had come.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment. Wang Ling opened his eyes. The three-petal golden lotus of King's Eyes overflowed from Wang Ling's pupils. A huge suppressive power was instantly generated!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Suddenly, everything in the universe seemed to be frozen at this moment. Even Wang Ying, who was trying to devour it, could not move. At this moment, he saw an illusion that everything was silent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was only then that Wang Ying finally realized his mistake.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He thought he copied everything from Wang Ling...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, this pair of King's Eyes is something he has never owned! King's Eyes cannot be copied. Unless he can personally pull out King's Eyes from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But how easy is this?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What is this..." Wang Ying was stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The situation was beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Logically speaking, there can be no items in this world that cannot be copied as shadows...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling knows. It started when Wang Ying showed this expression. The winner has been announced.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His King's Eyes are naturally unreplicable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even Wang Ling himself feels strange.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because King's Eyes is not included in "Dao". It is not a derivative of any Dao. It is something that Wang Ling is born with but doesn't know where it comes from.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is also the only object around Wang Ling that is no longer in "Dao".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">King's Eyes has many abilities.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Powerful power of suppression, removing the false and retaining the true, transcending illusions, and stopping the space. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can be done when necessary. Everything in sight will be destroyed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The closer you are to your opponent, the more powerful your King's Eyes can be.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Range is a major limitation of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the limited range is mainly because Wang Ling can suppress the power of King's Eyes. Especially when the sealing talisman is still there. At this time, the power of King's Eyes is only used less than 5%.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The range is naturally only 5%.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's over." Wang Ling stared at Wang Ying. He used the power of King's Eyes to distinguish the false and the real to re-condensate the huge black shadow in front of him. It gathered into the appearance of Wang Ying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest, Wang Ying was really anxious to take action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the cosmic refining circle is activated and the opponent is fighting against him, Wang Ling feels that the other party has a chance to touch him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's a pity. There is no if.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However. Is this really because Wang Ying is anxious?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling thinks there may be another reason for this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Whose idea was this?" At this time, Wang Ling looked at Wang Ying and asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Wang Ying is indeed eager to get rid of himself, as his own shadow. Wang Ling believes that Wang Ying's thoughts will never be so evil.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So the person who can think of sacrificing the entire solar system to gain enough power for himself is definitely not Wang Ying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other hand, Wang Ying seems to be in a hurry to take action. I am afraid that he has already thought of the situation at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's not anyone's idea..." Wang Ying turned his head. The sweat on his head soaked his white hair. The sweat beads peeled off from his body and flew into the universe. Finally, they quickly condensed into ice particles. Dissipated with the dust.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling pursed her lips.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he can't read Wang Ying's mind, he has enough patience.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"When you merge with me again, I will still know." Wang Ling looked at the White Hair in front of him and said solemnly: "But I want to hear you say it yourself."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"you..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This time, Wang Ying fell into silence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a shadow, Wang Ying feels that she has always been ignored.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He tried his best to get rid of Wang Ling. In the final analysis, he wanted to prove his sense of existence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I thought about it for a long time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying finally gave her hint: "Behind the Void Gate..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some things can be said. Some things cannot be said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling knows. This is probably all Wang Ying knows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ying smiled bitterly: "Erase me. Being your shadow... is really tiring..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is this what you mean?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He saw the boy's evasive eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After a few more seconds, Wang Ling stretched out his arms to the boy and took his hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In an instant, Wang Ying's whole body was scattered. Like a plate of quicksand, several springs and streams gradually merged with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What surprised Wang Ying was that not only did Wang Ling not completely erase him, it even retained all of his intelligence and memories.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The moment before returning to Wang Ling's body, Wang Ying opened her eyes wide and showed an unbelievable look: "You... aren't you afraid that I will run away again?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling shook his head slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Even if you escape, I will catch you back..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the moment when Wang Ying returned to the body, Wang Ling gave Wang Ying's answer in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The last step to get rid of Wang Ying. Wang Ling is to remove the all-encompassing pillar embedded in the Sun Spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the moment when Wang Ling used his spiritual energy to move away the Senluo Wanxiang Pillar, the Sun Spirit felt that his breathing suddenly became smoother. He looked at Wang Ling's expression. There was awe, but more of hesitation. Shivering: "Is this an immortal fight between gods..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling thought of the last tip Wang Ying gave him before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The source of all this is closely related to the gate of void that Master Li Xiaokai wanted to break through.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you know what is behind the Void Gate?" At this time, Wang Ling turned to the Sun Spirit and asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sun has been flexible for billions of years. Wang Ling felt that maybe the spirit of the sun could tell him the answer he wanted.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This question made the Sun Spirit think deeply.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After a long time, the hollow voice of the Sun Spirit came: "Behind the Void Gate, there is emptiness..."</p>
