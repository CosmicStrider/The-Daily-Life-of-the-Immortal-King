  <h1>Chapter 57 Zheng Tan's Independent Regimen </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Wang Ling jumped effortlessly to the top of the tree and lay prone to look at the small tree hole for a long time. He could feel the endless space inside the tree hole and immediately knew that it had been expanded using space expansion technology. This also proved that cat boss Zheng Tan absolutely wasn't unintelligent, otherwise it wouldn't have ever thought to open up the space.</p>

      <p>Big Cat proudly told Wang Ling that back then, Zheng Tan had spent a lot of energy opening up this space.</p>

      <p>It wasn't Zheng Tan who had originally thought of the plan, though, but the old willow tree which had already been here for three hundred years.</p>

      <p>According to Big Cat, back then the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had converged to open the old willow to spiritual wisdom. In the process of reaching the Tribulation Transcendence stage, a lightning bolt had struck and pierced the body of the tree, which unexpectedly and inadvertently stimulated the old willow's vitality.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan using the secret tree hole was also the old willow's idea.</p>

      <p>It took one hundred years to cultivate a person <sup>1</sup> and it was too lonely an existence, so to be surrounded by several companions was always good.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>('One hundred years to cultivate a person,'百年树人, actually means that it takes a long time to educate or train people, but in this context just refers largely to a very long period of time.)</dfn>

      <p>"How often does this spirit tree wake up?" Wang Ling looked at Big Cat as he asked telepathically.</p>

      <p>"You must call him Mr Shu!"</p>

      <p>Big Cat corrected him. "Mr Shu sleeps for quite a long time and only wakes up in the evening. His surname is Zhou."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Zhou... Shu... Ren <sup>2</sup> ?</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Zhou Shuren was a Chinese writer who was primarily known as an essayist and a translator. The pinyin for Shuren,树人,literally translates to 'tree person.')</dfn>

      <p>Wang Ling followed the cats and jumped into the tree hole. It was like moving through a space tunnel, and after a change in light and shadow, he finally saw the huge space inside. Just like the secret bases in movies and TV series, the whole space was neatly sectioned off and put to proper use.</p>

      <p>He saw several cats in white gowns walk past together balancing two books on their heads.</p>

      <p>Big Cat introduced them. "They're the research team in Boss Zheng Tan's group."</p>

      <p>Then, Wang Ling saw dozens of sparrows wearing small goggles pecking corn harmoniously in a nearby corn field...</p>

      <p>"They're our regiment's aerial company."</p>

      <p>After that, Big Cat pointed to several cats ahead of them wearing black face towels. "These ninja cats belong to the spy company. The cavalry company trains independently at a secret base outside the tree hole."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling asked telepathically, "Please tell me, what is your regiment called?"</p>

      <p>Big Cat pointed to a small stone tablet to one side of the base which had words scrawled on it in human language: Independent Regiment .</p>

      <p>Wang Ling looked at the stone tablet for a moment. While he was still stunned, Big Cat pointed to the stone tablet again and said, "Behind this stone tablet is an inscription by Mr Shu Ren."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling took a curious look and saw that the back of the stone tablet had been engraved with two poems...</p>

      <p>On the left: I coolly defy sazi <su>3</su> with fierce brows, yo. On the right: I am willing to bow my head to be a <sup>4</sup> yaer , yo.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Sazi is a traditional Chinese food where dough is pulled and twisted into very thin strips that are then deep fried in oil.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(While 'ya er'芽儿literally translates to "little bud" or "little sprout" in the Sichuan dialect, it can refer to the "penis.")</dfn>

      <p>Wang Ling was completely stunned. "..."</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>From the overall layout of the space and arrangement of teams, it had to be said that Zheng Tan was a very intelligent cat. A cavalry company, a spy company and even an air force composed of sparrows. It was simply incredible...</p>

      <p>The space inside the willow was very large and the Space Expansion Skill used was the most common type and nothing spectacular. However, this primitive Space Expansion Skill had been able to extend the space of a small tree hole to the size of a person's living room; for these cats, the space was already enough.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan's Regiment Office was in the deepest part of the base. Big Cat guided Wang Ling to the door of the office, then had several of its kitten underlings wait together with him at the door as it looked at him and said, "Brother, wait a moment, I'll go in to report first!"</p>

      <p>In less than five minutes, Zheng Tan strode out of the room. It had black, shiny fur and pointed ears; there was even a decorative copper bell on its tail that jingled as Zheng Tan walked, highlighting its might as the commander of this Independent Regiment. Wang Ling was certain that it must have been groomed by the thunderbolt tiger Tang Shi; only cats groomed by Tang Shi would have this kind of ruffian air about them.</p>

      <p>From the faint smell of its breath, it was not difficult for Wang Ling to guess that it had been enjoying its dinner; furthermore, it was a spicy seafood-flavored hot pot...</p>

      <p>When Zheng Tan saw the Persian cat, it couldn't help narrowing its heterochromatic eyes.</p>

      <p>To be able to sit in the position of commander of the regiment, it was obviously much more sensitive to this "Persian cat" than the lascivious Big Cat.</p>

      <p>Because the legendary Immortal Meow... was also a Persian cat!</p>

      <p>Whether it was Tang Shi, Song Ci or Yuan Qu, they had all ordered the cadres in their respective areas to be on the lookout especially for this cat breed and to inspect them with caution.</p>

      <p>But Immortal Meow had retired a very long time ago.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan had frequently searched nearby areas from time to time, but with no results to show for it.</p>

      <p>Now, suddenly hearing from Big Cat that a Persian cat was looking for it had been a shock.</p>

      <p>No way... this couldn't be a coincidence, right?</p>

      <p>It hadn't even finished chewing the spicy fish balls in its mouth before it ran outside.</p>

      <p>It looked carefully at the Persian cat in front of it, then saw that this cat was sitting cross-legged and floating gently in the air...</p>

      <p>Back then, Immortal Meow had opened the stray cats to spiritual wisdom, but had only imparted to them some simple Foundation Establishment body training methods. It hadn't taught any of the stray cats immortal spells. A Persian cat that was able to use the Suspension Spell... furthermore, wisps of mist hung in the air around it... nothing else needed to be said, Zheng Tan knew the identity of this Persian cat!</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan: "!!!"</p>

      <p>Big Cat: "Wow! Bro! Awesome magic trick!"</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan really wanted to smack this idiotic guy next to it to death. "..." Fuck your awesome! This is Immortal Meow! You retard!</p>

      <p>"Im... Immortal Meow?"</p>

      <p>Big Cat's tongue was knotted with fear.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan narrowed its eyes; it didn't need to guess, it knew this guy had probably made some fucking trouble again!</p>

      <p>"Boss, I really didn't know... I took three salted fish-flavored crispy noodle snack packets!" Trembling, Big Cat stretched out its paws and took the snacks out from its belly band.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan smacked Big Cat's head with one paw.</p>

      <p>This git really can't accomplish anything, but can spoil everything!</p>

      <p>Lustful and greedy!</p>

      <p>Fuck! Cut your bonus! Deduct your salary! You're not going to get any year-end bonus dried fish!</p>

      <p>How can my own chief of staff be such a witless idiot?!</p>

      <p>Ah! Fuck it! —</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan slapped one paw to its face, too angry to speak.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling picked up the crispy noodle snacks from the ground and instantly felt better. He got straight to the point, stretching out one paw to draw Wang Ming's portrait on the ground and at the same time telling Zheng Tan his request telepathically.</p>

      <p>He hadn't used this Space Sketching Skill since winning a national art competition as a kid, as it was really too eye-catching.</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan nodded, then looked back at its chief of staff that was lying repentantly on the ground with its paws on its ears.</p>

      <p>"Da Biao, you dumbass! It's time for you to redeem yourself!"</p>

      <p>While speaking, Zheng Tan kicked Big Cat to its feet. "Notify Battalions One, Two, and Three, the calvary, the spy battalion, and the air force: relying on favorable terrain, go out and do a thorough search of Number 59 High School!"</p>
