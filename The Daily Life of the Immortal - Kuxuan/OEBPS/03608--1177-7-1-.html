  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1177 Kill one person in 7 steps</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro's {Seven Killing Techniques} became famous in those days. It is said that no matter what enemy he encounters, he will decapitate him within seven steps. Now when I see it again, this sense of murderous oppression is really shocking. Feeling a little suffocated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If it weren't for the average strength of Wang Zhen and the other three, even if these members of the resident special forces encountered Zaomen Rokuro at this moment, their bodies would be restrained by a huge sense of oppression. They would be unable to move as if they were directly petrified. Half a minute.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zaomen Rokuro died in a hunter action back then. But he was still very strong. Everyone should be careful." Xiao Yin took the initiative to take a step forward with bare feet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a holy beast, it has strong self-healing ability. Even if its head is severed, it can be repaired and brought back to life in an instant as long as it can be reconnected immediately.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is said that Zaomen Rokuro's Seven Killing Technique is amazing in the world. But Xiao Yin believes that the opponent will definitely not be able to destroy him... No matter how strong your Seven Killing Technique is, my self-healing ability is not bad either!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, when Zaomen Rokuro saw Xiao Yin moving forward with bare feet, Zaomen Rokuro took a step back unconsciously. He placed his hand on his katana. Although he was blindfolded, his movements were still precise and graceful: " You're three against one. I'm afraid that's unfair."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Unexpectedly. As a darknet criminal originally from Sun Island, Zaomen Rokuro's Mandarin is surprisingly good. There is even a Beijing accent in it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't worry. We are one on one. If I lose, we will leave immediately." The expression on Xiao Yin's face was very confident. He believed that Zaomen Rokuro was not his opponent. Moreover, Zaomen Rokuro was already about to die. He He should not have appeared in this world. Facing hell is his only way out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No. It's unfair for the three of you. I should be allowed to choose my opponent." Zaomen Rokuro said. His eyes were covered with red cloth. There was a very harsh feeling when the hoarse voice came out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xiao Yin didn't understand why Zaomen Rokuro refused to challenge her. She sighed: "Then tell me. Who do you choose?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro lowered his head. A few drops of cold sweat could not help but flow from his forehead.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, his {Seven Killing Techniques of Gods and Ghosts} is not a sword technique. It is a kind of perception and calculation ability.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He can measure the fighting prowess between each other and calculate how many sword blows the opponent will have to take before he can completely kill him...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, he is not blind. The reason why he chose to be blindfolded is to improve his perception ability and avoid visual interference.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">High-end swordsmen can fight with just hearing. Because when they close their eyes and lose vision, their energy becomes more concentrated. The accuracy and explosive power of the sword will also improve as their mental power increases.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro has predicted many enemies with his famous {Seven Killing Techniques}. And he deliberately chose those who predicted that they would be killed by him within 7 swords. In order to create the terrifying atmosphere of killing with 7 swords. ..</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the enemy he faces cannot be killed within the Seven Swords, Zaomen Rokuro will subconsciously choose to avoid the battle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His reputation is still very important.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The said 7 swords must kill with 7 pieces. One more piece will have a huge impact on his character.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even now, Zaomen Rokuro has been resurrected by the man behind the scenes. As a serious dead person, he still pays attention to his character.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The 7 steps to kill were agreed upon... no more steps...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So, when Zaomen Rokuro received the order from the person behind the scenes to station himself at the entrance of the stalactite cave, Zaomen Rokuro was planning how to shock the world again with his Seven Killing Techniques.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was thinking about his revival plan. As a result, Xiao Yin, Wang Zhen, and Er Ha came to his door.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro took a deep breath and put his hand on his katana.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He realized his chance had come.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, when Xiao Yin took the initiative to confront him, a number suddenly flashed in Zaomen Rokuro's mind: +823192391 sword...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He actually had to chop more than 800 million swords in a row to kill the young man in front of him?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What is the background of this young man...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">More than 800 million swords. This is simply an impossible task. Even if the opponent stands motionless in front of him and lets him chop them, he can't finish them in a short time!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This was too far away from the Seven Swords Killing target! It even made Zaomen Rokuro extremely suspicious that there might be something wrong with his prediction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So he raised an objection and asked for someone else to fight him!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then. He turned his attention to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, the number that flashed in Wang Zhen's mind was longer than that of Xiao Yin...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He needed more than a billion sword cuts to kill Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro took a deep breath.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He now suspects that there is a serious problem with his brain...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It stands to reason that his strength is not weak. At least it is more than enough compared to these special forces members outside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">but...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The numbers shown in both predictions are extremely abnormal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This made Zaomen Rokuro break into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, he placed his last hope on a young man with green hair.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Result. Er Ha also shows a lot of numbers...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although it also showed that it would take more than 700 million sword cuts to kill him, Zaomen Rokuro has determined that Er Ha is the weakest among the three. And there must be something wrong with his {Seven Killing Techniques}.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zaomen Rokuro suspected that maybe he had been dead for too long and forgot to add a decimal point to the Seven Killing Techniques of Gods and Demons. This led to such a terrifying number in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The main reason is that he thinks these three people are ordinary. They don't have the slightest breath in their bodies. They don't look like too powerful opponents.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The thought in my mind that it was my misjudgment that was wrong was even more confirmed in my mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the problem is that the decimal point is not added, then among the three people in front of you, only Er Ha is 700 million swords... add the decimal point. Remove this 100 million swords, then it will be 7 swords.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. After having such psychological comfort, Zaomen Rokuro breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He quickly put his hand on his katana. He stepped forward with an arrow. He ducked from the side with great agility, aimed at Er Ha and stabbed with his sword!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha also didn't expect that Zaomen Rokuro would directly choose him as his opponent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he had already been on guard.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With this sword, Zaomen Rokuro moved a total of three steps...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words, he only needs to move four steps. Will he be fatally injured?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Suddenly, Er Ha actually felt a little excitement in his heart. It seemed that he had not been hurt for a long time since he turned into a dog... and when he gradually got used to the comfortable life on earth, in the past Those years of fighting among the monster clan gave him a nostalgic feeling of reminiscing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now fighting against Zaomen Rokuro. This made Er Ha think of what happened a long time ago for a moment...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In a daze, Zaomen Rokuro has moved to the seventh step.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Be careful, dog brother!" Wang Zhen just finished his words. He saw Zaomen Rokuro's samurai sword slashing hard at Er Ha's dog head...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Bang! A sound!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Something broke on the spot...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But what broke was not Er Ha’s dog head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But. Zaomen Rokuro's samurai sword...</p>
