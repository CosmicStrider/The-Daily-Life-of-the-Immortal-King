  <h1>Chapter 33 Sun Rong's Domain </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Shortly after Sun Rong left, Wang Ling woke up.</p>

    <p>He swore he had just wanted to close his eyes for a bit; he hadn't expected to actually sleep so soundly — what a real blunder!</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Ling fell into deep thought — how long had it been since he had actually truly slept?</p>

    <p>Calculating roughly, he had probably stopped sleeping properly altogether when he turned five or six years old.</p>

    <p>At his current realm, he didn't need to sleep at all; a moment's meditation was enough to instantly replenish his vigor.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, nothing was more familiar to him than the Wang family's small villa. After all, he had been living there for sixteen years, but even then he didn't dare sleep so easily there.</p>

    <p>He thought himself a very vigilant person.</p>

    <p>So how on earth had he fallen asleep in this utterly unfamiliar environment?</p>

    <p>As the thoughts spun in his mind, Wang Ling couldn't help recalling a scientific report he had read before. Its general gist was: "If you can fall asleep quickly in an unfamiliar environment, it's proof that something in the environment is a source of warmth and safety for you."</p>

    <p>He was now almost sure that this report had to be false...</p>

    <p>— What a joke!</p>

    <p>These were all people he had to be the most wary of!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rubbed his face roughly and sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Luckily he hadn't slept for very long this time, nor had it been a deep sleep, otherwise who knew what awful consequences there might have been...</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling knew he had a habit of snoring as soon as he entered deep sleep.</p>

    <p>The force of his snores in deep sleep was on par with the power of a Tomahawk cruise missile.</p>

    <p>This suddenly reminded Wang Ling of a nursery rhyme...</p>

    <p><em>The sun is shining in the sky~ The flowers are smiling at me~ A little bird says morning morning morning~ Why are you carrying an explosive?</em></p>

    <p><em>I am going to school~ The teachers have no clue~ I shall run once the string is pulled~ School will disappear with a boom~</em></p>

    <p>The main point of this nursery rhyme was the last sentence: <em>School will disappear with a boom </em>...</p>

    <p>For others, this nursery rhyme might be just a joke.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, it really wasn't a joke at all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Teacher Wang left after leading Wang Ling and the other two boys to the teaching building for the student exchange meet in the afternoon. He didn't go far, however, as he was responsible for their safety.</p>

    <p>The student exchange meet, as its name suggested, was an activity for the students. So apart from Teacher Wang, there were no other teachers taking part in the meet. The students would interact and discuss with each other of their own accord, so that they could create happy tension and ignite sparks of wisdom through an enjoyable exchange.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu had arrived at the venue early on. As Wang Ling and the other two entered the classroom, they saw familiar faces from that morning.</p>

    <p>What was different was that the faces were all black: Tang Jingze's, Fang Huaqing's, Liang Wei's, and his two younger brothers Liang Zheng's and Liang Fei's...</p>

    <p>After all, in less than half a day, their twelve spirit gathering arrays had already blown up. None of these guys would have a happy face on.</p>

    <p>Actually, right before this student exchange activity, Director Xie had already called Tang Jingze to her office to fully and directly berate him for an hour. As soon as he had been released from the office, he had had to come here to preside over the meeting. Wang Ling felt that this really was tough on him...</p>

    <p>The multimedia classroom they were using could hold up to two hundred people. Tang Jingze sat on the dais with the vice president Fang Huaqing next to him.</p>

    <p>The first row of seats in the classroom had been specially set aside for the Number 60 High School team as the guests.</p>

    <p>The second row onward were all occupied by Number 59 High School students who were voluntarily attending the meeting.</p>

    <p>The group from Number 60 High School sat quietly and waited for the meeting to officially begin.</p>

    <p>One after another, people continued to enter the classroom until there weren't any seats left. Even then they didn't stop pouring in... what was more, the rate at which people were coming in was steadily increasing...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that there were even quite a few who had directly brought in small wooden stools with them as they took over the aisles. Some even sat floating in the air on flying carpets...</p>

    <p>Seeing how the classroom was becoming full to two times its capacity, Tang Jingze's face grew even darker, and he turned his head to look at Fang Huaqing next to him. "I told Liang Wei to look for a background audience, but not this many! We're holding a meeting, not a concert!"</p>

    <p>"We really didn't recruit anyone this time, they volunteered," Fang Huaqing whispered, feeling very aggrieved.</p>

    <p>"Volunteered? For what?" Tang Jingze felt it was inconceivable.</p>

    <p>It had been like a barren land when the people from Number 58 High School came a few weeks ago! It had been so bare that even Director Xie couldn't stand it anymore, and had forced students from several classes to act as a background audience.</p>

    <p>Fang Huaqing sighed deeply, helplessly eyeing Sun Rong sitting in the first row... what else? Of course it was to get a glimpse of Sun Rong, the Young Miss of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, the Nation's School Beauty! Just because of these titles, Number 59 High School had already gone crazy long before she came to the school...</p>

    <p>This was also the reason why the school hadn't announced exactly when the Number 60 High School delegation would arrive. Otherwise, Fang Huaqing felt that Tang Jingze wouldn't even have had the opportunity to offer them the fruit and vegetable juice.</p>

    <p>It was clear that people had finally received confirmation that the group from Number 60 High School had arrived.</p>

    <p>From senior grade one to grade three, almost all the boys in Number 59 High School were running riot.</p>

    <p>Hence the scene in front of them now...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, I want to have children with you!"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, I want to sing you a song!"</p>

    <p>"I am drinking alone! I wish my girl was with me together!"</p>

    <p>"Eyes fixed on each other alone! I only want to be with Sun Rong forever!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Shit! Tang Jingze gritted his teeth. "Throw this MC out!"</p>

    <p>Fang Huaqing: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Chen Chao and the others had never thought that Sun Rong's impact outside school would actually be this potent.</p>

    <p>Although she was in Number 60 High School, Sun Rong was the pinnacle of all school beauties that couldn't be surpassed. Every single time she walked through the school grounds, riots would inevitably break out...</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had even given this phenomenon a name, "Sun Rong's Domain."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that this sphere of influence didn't work on everyone, but it still had a considerable impact on regular passersby.</p>

    <p>"That is just like Classmate Sun Rong! The godly power of Sun Rong's Domain has truly brought us glory!"</p>

    <p>As her classmates, Chen Chao, Lin Xiaoyu and Guo Hao were all full of sincere pride.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please settle down..." It was a chaotic scene. Tang Jingze couldn't take it anymore and yelled into the microphone.</p>

    <p>His voice was very loud, thanks to the specialized Hermes microphone in his hand, and it resounded in every corner of the two-hundred seat classroom.</p>

    <p>The situation still couldn't be controlled... almost every male student at Number 59 High School was lost in heated discussion on Sun Rong, with no sign of stopping at all!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please settle down!" Tang Jingze enunciated each word, his face already completely black as pickled cucumber.</p>

    <p>Again, his words didn't have much of a positive effect. Conversely, not only did the noise in the classroom not subside, it actually grew a little louder.</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze: "..." Damn it!</p>

    <p>"Everyone... I have to trouble you to please be quiet!" Tang Jingze said a third time, his stern voice carrying a slight warning.</p>

    <p>This time, under pressure from the president of the student union, the noise at the scene did subside a little. But a bare second later... the rowdy voices broke noise limits, and even reached new heights!</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze: "..." Fuck!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, I beg of you... please settle down!"</p>

    <p>This was already the fourth time he was yelling at them to stop!</p>

    <p>Judging from Tang Jingze's aggrieved and despairing cries...</p>

    <p>This guy was most likely about to go insane...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the side, Chen Chao shook his head. "Tragic! Too tragic!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao couldn't help letting out a sigh. "'People scattered by a torn land; the country no longer belonging to its men'... the grand president of the student union in name only, how sad..."</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu <em>tsk </em>ed softly. "Do you know what it means to lose your wits? This is it!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>
