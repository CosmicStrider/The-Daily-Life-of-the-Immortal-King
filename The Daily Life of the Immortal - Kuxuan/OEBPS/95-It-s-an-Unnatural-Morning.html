  <h1>Chapter 95 It's an Unnatural Morning </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling used the Space Sketching Skill to draw Teacher Pan's image on paper. The last time he had used this skill was when he had asked Zheng Tan to look for Wang Ming. He hadn't expected that this time he would be drawing his own teacher-in-charge!</p>

    <p>Gazing at Wang Ling's sketch, Father Wang pushed his black-rimmed glasses up and was lost in an enigmatic silence. "..."</p>

    <p>The woman in the drawing was a long-term office worker who was fairly chubby since she sat down most of the time. Although it wasn't to the point of having a bucket waist <sup>1</sup> yet, it was apparent that there was already a floater ring around her belly. There were streaks of grey hair in her flyaway ponytail, and age had added quite a number of wrinkles to her face. No matter how hard Father Wang tried, he couldn't match Teacher Pan with the image of that youthful girl in his mind...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A "bucket waist" figure is a body that is basically one wide trunk from top to bottom.)</dfn>

    <p>"Are you sure... your teacher-in-charge, Teacher Pan, is that slightly green girl?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling kicked Er Ha in its furry butt, and it let out an aggrieved woof.</p>

    <p>Ss ! —</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't help drawing in a sharp breath... this really was a fucking huge shock!</p>

    <p>It was the middle of the night; Mother Wang was upstairs putting on a face mask while the old man had already fallen asleep much earlier on. The Wang family's father and son couldn't stop sighing as they leaned lifelessly against the sofa in the study and stared at the drawing of Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>The most troublesome thing wasn't that Teacher Pan was Grandfather Wang's first love, but that now, Wang Ling had to find a way to arrange for the two of them to meet. This was the trickiest part!</p>

    <p>Completely overwhelmed by this matter, Father Wang didn't even have the mood to type and just wanted to calm down... after placing the picture on top of the table, he went upstairs to sleep.</p>

    <p>Back in his small bedroom, Wang Ling didn't sleep a wink the whole night as he tried in vain to think of a way for the old man and Teacher Pan to meet by chance perfectly without making it seem too abrupt after so many years.</p>

    <p>This was a real pain in the ass...</p>

    <p>Early the next morning, it was almost dawn when Wang Ling left home. Once again, the old man sat by the front door, basking in the sun.</p>

    <p>This time, the old man had put two cold dishes in Wang Ling's lunchbox. One was black fungus and cucumber salad, the other fuqi feipian <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a Szechuan dish made from sliced beef and beef offal, and translates to "husband and wife lung pieces.")</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling was taken aback. "..." Somehow, he felt that there was some meaning behind these two dishes.</p>

    <p>As he stretched out his hand to take the lunchbox, the old man pulled him in. "Ling Ling, I dreamt of your grandmother again..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent.</p>

    <p>"She'd become young again, as pretty as before..." The old man grinned happily. "The day she passed away, I held her in my arms and she whispered to me that in our next lives, we... we would be married again."</p>

    <p>Saying this, the old man's eyes watered a little, though he tried to hold the tears back. "She told me in my dream that she wanted to eat my cold dishes... these two dishes, Ling Ling, please help me burn <sup>3</sup> them for her!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(In Chinese-Daoist tradition, family members burn joss paper as "ghost money" for those who have died to use in the afterlife.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." In the end, these weren't made for me?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Today at school, the atmosphere in every class was unusually harmonious, since Secretary Dakang had sent over an inspection team. The act of copying homework had dwindled significantly in each class. As Wang Ling stepped into the teaching building, he caught sight of a young man with a blue ribbon around his arm walking through the corridor and inspecting each class to check if anyone was breaking this rule.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard of this young man; he was called Yu Heng, a Grade Three senior at Number 60 High School. He was also the current group (clan) leader of the inspection group of the Student Union of Number 60 High School, and had been given the nickname "Clan Leader Yu"!</p>

    <p>The thing about him was that he was very experienced and sophisticated in his duties. There would always be students breaking the rules in school early in the morning, but as long as Clan Leader Yu didn't catch them at it, he wouldn't bother exposing them; since he would be graduating soon, there was no point in offending people needlessly. Additionally, he also didn't have a habit of doing repeat inspections. He would do a casual sweep of each class as he walked by and consider his duty done. The reason was simple — as a graduating student of Senior Grade Three, he hadn't finished his own damn homework yet! When did he have extra time to do inspections?!</p>

    <p>But he had no choice, since in many cases, school leaders just liked to create meaningless regulations. He didn't believe that nobody copied homework in those key city high schools... of course, this didn't mean that he encouraged this type of behavior.</p>

    <p>This was the so-called "what is rational is real, and what is real is rational"...</p>

    <p>Clan Leader Yu felt that it was understandable for students to copy homework once or twice if they were unable to finish it on time due to some unpredictable factors.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at class, he saw Clan Leader Yu step into Grade One, Class Three. Clan Leader Yu swept his gaze lazily around the class and asked a little tiredly, "Who is your commissary in charge of studies?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao stood up and raised his hand.</p>

    <p>"I am..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao wasn't tall, and looked like a primary school student in front of Yu Heng. He lowered his head and blinked. "Senior Yu, don't worry, our class is very serious! We definitely... don't have anyone who copies homework here."</p>

    <p>Yu Heng's dead fish eyes rested on Su Xiao for a while. With one glance he could tell that this wooden and adorable junior brother was lying. His tells were: wavering speech, shifty eyes, unnatural hand and feet movements... also, what the hell was with this mysterious blush?!</p>

    <p>But since nobody had indeed been caught red-handed copying homework, Yu Heng didn't bother to make a fuss. "Well, today's inspection ends here." Upon saying this, he even patted Su Xiao on the head, exclaiming in his heart that this lad had a bright future.</p>

    <p>Whether it was in primary school, junior high school or senior high school, Grade One students were always the most cautious and timid; after committing even the smallest misdeed, they would be deathly afraid of being caught, and so were on edge the whole time. As an old driver <sup>4</sup> who had been studying at Number 60 High School for three years, Clan Leader Yu had seen into Su Xiao's heart with one glance. But all these didn't matter, since he reckoned that before long, Su Xiao would become an old pro at this.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(In Chinese netspeak, an "old driver" is someone who is very experienced in a particular field and very familiar with all aspects of it.)</dfn>

    <p>When Wang Ling got to his seat, Clan Leader Yu had already swiftly finished his inspection and was ready to leave. Just as he stepped out of Grade One, Class Three, Guo Hao cried out, "Don't worry, Clan Leader Yu, we outstanding youngsters uphold the three values and have resolved to never copy homework!" After saying these words, Guo Hao felt the red neckscarf <sup>5</sup> hidden at the bottom of his heart glow even brighter.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>5</sup>(The red scarf is the uniform item of the Young Pioneers, a mass youth organization in China which comes under the communist party ..)</dfn>

    <p>Su Xiao covered his face a little ashamedly. "Classmate Guo, your, your nose..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao rubbed his nose and unexpectedly discovered that it was bleeding. "Ah, I must be too excited! Yep, that has to be it! The righteousness inside my heart is telling me that copying homework is a very evil deed!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fixed his eyes on Guo Hao. "..." This guy had definitely used the Four Pens Technique to copy homework!</p>

    <p>After that, Guo Hao returned to his seat. But as soon as his butt touched the chair, he immediately stood up as if he had been electrocuted.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling then heard Guo Hao sigh, " Ai , my ass hurts... I shouldn't have used the Five Pens Technique..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What weird shit did you fucking get up to this morning?!</p>
