  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1215 Claw machine!</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a member of the Wang Ling fan club. Now under Xia Ming's call, everyone has begun to silently deploy a package of plans for Wang Ling... such as this love lunch. It is the "King of Routines" part of it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Prepare for two people. Li Youyue had thought of it while making bento.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As Sun Rong's best friend in school, after this national physical education exchange conference, the deep friendship between the two has deepened.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The beauty of adulthood!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is what a best friend should do!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Instead of thinking about comparing boyfriends all day long.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When I see that my best friend’s boyfriend is better than me, I want to steal someone else’s boyfriend.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Especially when your best friend is a popular young lady, turning yourself into a wingman and assisting is the most correct way.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Youyue thought clearly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As long as you can succeed, your path will be widened.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Stealing things with the eldest lady, whether it's people or items. I'm afraid the end result is that the bodyguards drag him out and sink into the river...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong closed the lunch box with a red face.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She was really not prepared to eat a lunch box with Wang Ling. Her heartbeat was so nervous that it almost jumped out of her chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling! Can you...can you accompany me to play video games? There is a video game arcade on the third floor!" Sun Rong requested.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to make the situation less embarrassing, the girl used her usual method - changing the topic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling was stunned for a moment. He couldn't figure out why there was a video arcade in this hospital building.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This hospital is very special! There is an arcade on the third floor. You can buy game coins by swiping your card or scanning the code! It is also called [Employee Salary Recovery Plan]." Wang Ling didn't expect to know the structure of the hospital very well. .</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He listened to the girl chattering and introducing him to the arcade.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The purpose of building an arcade is to relax medical staff. The most popular equipment is called the medical boxing room. Almost every day, the city will add some malicious medical personnel to the list of dishonest people. And these people are It will be converted into game data and appear in this device as enemies... You can get points by beating enemies hard. The top three with the highest rankings every month will get extra bonuses!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Obviously, this may not be the first time the girl has been hospitalized for observation like this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There may be some hidden secrets here.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">During the competition, Sun Rong's injury was not serious. However, he was sent away overnight under the arrangement of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone feels overprotective.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But now from various signs, Wang Ling feels that something may have happened to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He quietly moved the King's Eyes. Gazing into Sun Rong's soul.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I saw that the girl's soul was as pure as water. Just like her sword spirit Aohai, there was no trace of being polluted.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Isn't it a curse?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang LingUnexpectedly, his first instinct was wrong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Curiosity drove Wang Ling to find out more about what happened to the girl. As a result, the girl ate a pink pill. Smoke suddenly filled the whole body. It was completed in an instant like a magical girl. Changed clothes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a versatile styling pill. It is specially designed by Huaguo Shui Lian Group for women. It can combine your clothes and cosmetics with space compression technology. After taking it, you can instantly change your clothes and makeup in 2 seconds. Makeup operations!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the girl was wearing a pure white dress. Her whole person looked completely new.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling. Let's go!" The girl smiled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling sighed in his heart. He counted the time and felt that it would be late to go home again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's better to accompany a girl to the arcade and play video games than to eat lunch together in the ward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are no crispy noodles in this lunch box, and there is no pepper for dry noodles. Although it is beautifully made, Wang Ling just doesn't have any appetite.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, a new message came from the Huaguo Shui Lian Group Security Command Center.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sir, the hospital's mechanical eye report.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The young lady and the boy are currently moving to the video game arcade on the third floor." Jiang Xiaoche reported the current situation truthfully. "Playing video games is good. This is how young people build relationships!" Mr. Boss Sun was satisfied. Nodding. The more he looked at Wang Ling, the more he liked it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the ward, her granddaughter listed so many different things. Houses, cars, land and even laser missiles were moved out... However, this boy was completely unmoved! He was so indifferent to fame and fortune. He was so indifferent to money. A young man who has no desire for material things is really rare in the world!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What do you plan to do, sir?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"See what they want to play. Play by ear. I remember. The video arcade in this hospital was funded by our group."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes. We can adjust all the equipment remotely." At this time, Jiang Xiaoche looked at the picture on the screen: "Miss, they seem to be going to play with the claw machine."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Claw machine?" Boss Sun smiled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The claw machine is a good opportunity to test your patience.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some young people would deliberately destroy the dolls if they couldn't catch them. He wanted to see if Wang Ling's temper would become irritable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the general claw machine actually has core settings inside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For example, it takes 1 game coin to catch it once. The internal setting of the claw machine will increase the strength of the claws when you catch it for the 49th time, making it easier to catch the doll.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I am happy to have caught a doll, but in fact I just spent 49 yuan to buy a doll.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course. It is not ruled out that some masters of claw machines can analyze it from a mechanical perspective. They can use hook throwing, drifting, etc. to clear the claw machine again and again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These people will all be blacklisted by the arcade.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Change all the dolls to the heaviest ones. Also adjust the strength of the claws. Make them the loosest." At this time, Boss Sun ordered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes." Jiang Xiaoche nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. When Sun Rong took Wang Ling to grab the claw machine. Wang Ling saw the claw machine like this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Each of the dolls in this claw machine is as big as a basketball! The most outrageous thing is the hook! It’s only as big as an ear scoop!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even Sun Rong feels that the structure of this claw machine seems a little different from before...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling...This may be the most difficult claw machine at present..." the girl explained helplessly. She glanced around the nearby claw machines. Almost all machines are like this!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is impossible to catch such a big doll with such a small hook!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in theory, it doesn't seem to be completely impossible to catch.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As long as the hook is strong enough, you might be able to get the doll out by grabbing the hanging ring behind the doll's head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Wang Ling. You want to try it..." The girl looked at the black heart claw machine and felt a little desperate in her heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To the girl's surprise, Wang Ling actually planned to catch him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yeah." Wang Ling replied. Cherish words like gold.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Um, I'll put the coin in for you... But, can you really catch him..." The girl remained doubtful about this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling really doesn’t have much experience in catching dolls. He can’t even be said to be a master of the claw machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for why Wang Ling is interested in the claw machine in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The reason is simple.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because there are dolls in this claw machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All kinds of raccoons.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ling had already put his hand on the joystick of the claw machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He's about to start. Show off.</p>
