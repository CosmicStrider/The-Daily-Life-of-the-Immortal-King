  <h1>Chapter 40 Er Dan the Cool and Aloof Parrot </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>After morning radio gymnastics was over, Teacher Wang arranged to meet Wang Ling in a small corner for a chat during the afternoon break.</p>

      <p>It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, just about his performance in the radio gymnastics as usual.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling did understand the situation very clearly. After all, they had come here this time as representatives of their school, and since they were at another school, they had to be even more aware of their image and temperament. The vast majority of teachers believed that no matter how smooth one was with a spirit sword or how proficient in drawing a Dao talisman, only the ordinary radio gymnastics could best embody a student's spirit.</p>

      <p>This was the reason why until now, even in the Scientific Cultivation era, cultivation schools still hadn't banned radio gymnastics.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, Teacher Wang was a gentle man. Being approachable had always been one of his special traits, plus he had attended the teachers' regular meeting in the morning... he seemed to have found his springtime, so he was in a particularly good mood. He just told Wang Ling that he should pay attention to his image as a student representing Number 60 High School, then patted his butt and walked away, a spring in his step.</p>

      <p>Lightly, Teacher Wang left... as lightly as he had come...</p>

      <p>Seeing Teacher Wang's buoyant mood, Wang Ling instantly composed this poem in his heart.</p>

      <p>A dopey, artsy youth who had fallen into the river of love...</p>

      <p>Sure enough, people in love were all touched in the head!</p>

      <p>This was the first time that Wang Ling felt that there was something wrong with this bouncy Teacher Wang.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>After the private chat with Teacher Wang, Wang Ling casually thought of something.</p>

      <p>If it had been Teacher Pan with her raging temper instead of Teacher Wang who had dragged him into that corner, Wang Ling felt that given her character, she wouldn't have been able to stop herself from smacking him around... thinking of this, he couldn't help shuddering.</p>

      <p>The last person who had forcefully hit him had been Eldest Young Master Xu Ying of the Three Young Masters of Burying Love, and his grave was covered with grass taller than three meters now... either way, whether it was a responsibility to Teacher Pan, or even more so to the people around him, Wang Ling was more certain than ever that it was necessary to brainwash the entire nation on the night of the next full moon!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>In the afternoon, Teacher Wang sent a WeChat message for everyone to gather in Number 59 High School's gymnasium.</p>

      <p>There were only two days left to the crucial spirit sword exchange meet. As the teacher leading the team, he felt it was necessary for them to train accordingly.</p>

      <p>Number 59 High School's gymnasium was very large. In most Foundation Establishment high schools now, the interior of such a large place would contain another space. From the outside it didn't look very big, but the area inside had been expanded using the Space Expansion Skill.</p>

      <p>In fact, space expansion was very common. Take for example the storage pockets of the school uniform and Teacher Wang's snack drawer, which surpassed a supermarket's inventory... this simple skill of enlarging a space area was now already very commonly practiced and was completely a part of everyday life.</p>

      <p>And the biggest benefit was that it had significantly lowered property prices.</p>

      <p>It made it impossible for the deeply-hated real estate speculators to stir up trouble...</p>

      <p>"Strange, why hasn't Teacher Wang showed up?" Lin Xiaoyu asked, puzzled. They were in a sectioned-off training area in Number 59 High School's gymnasium and had been waiting for some time.</p>

      <p>Everyone's impression of Teacher Wang had always been of a punctual man.</p>

      <p>"Let's wait a little longer." Sun Rong also frowned softly and felt that it was very strange. Generally, as long as it was Teacher Wang who arranged the time, he would either arrive before or on the dot, and would never be so easily late.</p>

      <p>"He wouldn't have run into trouble, right?" Lin Xiaoyu said again.</p>

      <p>"..." Sun Rong was silent.</p>

      <p>She had personally witnessed Teacher Wang's true prowess. Moreover, his identity was a mystery, and even Huaguo Water Curtain Group hadn't been able to find anything on his background. Given the type of man he was, it could already be considered not bad if he didn't stir up trouble with other people.</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ling was also silent.</p>

      <p>He carefully considered Lin Xiaoyu's words and felt that what this fujoshi said was actually reasonable, because Teacher Wang had indeed run into trouble... if being lucky in love could be called trouble.</p>

      <p>While everyone was discussing Teacher Wang, in the end, speak of the devil, and he shall appear...</p>

      <p>From outside the gym, a stout figure stood silhouetted in the dazzling sunlight, casting a long shadow on the ground.</p>

      <p>Although they couldn't see the person's face clearly, from the shadow on the ground, everyone knew who it was.</p>

      <p>In the next moment, this shadow suddenly sprang up like a ghost, giving everyone a fright.</p>

      <p>Then, they watched in silent astonishment as a large fatty came bounding up to them... Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu were dumbfounded.</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Now it wasn't just Wang Ling; other people could also tell... there was something wrong with Teacher Wang today!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Teacher Wang's small, fat face was flushed and radiant like a blooming peach blossom. Sunlight seemed to pour out of his mouth as he laughed, it was too damn blinding!</p>

      <p>"Did he win the lottery? Or level up to the legendary five kills <sup>1</sup> ?" The corners of Chen Chao's mouth twitched, an uncomprehending expression on his face. He himself felt that he was a fairly ignorant type of person, but if he could tell with one look that there was something off with Teacher Wang... then it wasn't a simple problem, but a really big one!</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from the online game 'King of Glory' and refers to the number of consecutive kills a player can get.)</dfn>

      <p>Of course, Wang Ling was probably the only person in Number 60 High School who knew why Teacher Wang was so happy. Very regretfully, Wang Ling didn't like to gossip, so his mouth was sealed.</p>

      <p>This situation really made Guo Hao want to choke...</p>

      <p>As Number 60 High School's famous gossip line, the grand master who knew everything, this was the first time Guo Hao felt that his reputation was in danger.</p>

      <p>"Seems like you don't really know everything," Chen Chao deliberately teased.</p>

      <p>"Is that a challenge?" Guo Hao raised his eyebrow.</p>

      <p>There was actually something he didn't know?</p>

      <p>Impossible!</p>

      <p>He held his arm out horizontally and Er Dan the parrot hopped off his shoulder, turning its head to groom its white feathers. A normal parrot would speak from time to time as it imitated the words it heard, but Er Dan was an intelligent parrot. In Guo Hao's own words, it would only speak when he allowed it to; apart from that, it didn't even dare fart.</p>

      <p>It was because everyone firmly believed in these words that Guo Hao had obtained the title "Guo Hao." In everyone's eyes, this was probably the most remarkable pet Guo Hao had ever trained since he became involved in the soul pet business.</p>

      <p>"If even you don't know what's going on with Teacher Wang, do you expect Er Dan to tell you?" Chen Chao couldn't help laughing.</p>

      <p>"Er Dan, show this bumpkin your ability! Don't let our Soul Servant Shop lose face!" Guo Hao pointed at Er Dan, so worked up that he was spitting saliva. The Soul Servant Shop he had mentioned was actually the name of his family's ancestral store for soul pets.</p>

      <p>In fact, at the beginning of the semester, Wang Ling had found that Er Dan the parrot wasn't so simple. He had privately given it another nickname, "Ice Sculpture." Because it didn't like to talk, it hadn't said much all this time as it maintained an attitude all day long that wasn't happy or sad, disillusioned with human society.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling's Mind-Reading Ability, which was usually an open channel, had never received a single thing from Er Dan's mind, which was enough to show how cool and aloof this parrot was.</p>

      <p>That was, until now. When Guo Hao's saliva sprayed onto the pure white feathers that Er Dan was proud of... Er Dan finally couldn't take it anymore!</p>

      <p>It rolled its eyes disgustedly at Guo Hao, then Wang Ling heard it curse vehemently in its heart: <em>this fucking retard! Don't you know this boss likes to be clean!</em></p>

      <p>Hearing Er Dan's thoughts for the first time, Wang Ling was startled in his heart; he had never expected that Er Dan, who preferred to not speak, would in this situation actually burst out because of its neat freak tendencies... it seemed not only was it a cool and aloof parrot, it was also a parrot with a bad temper.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, from the unabashed and genuinely haughty attitude in Er Dan's heart, Wang Ling felt that perhaps all this time, Guo Hao, who was this parrot's owner and gave people the impression that he was a parrot expert...</p>

      <p>...Didn't seem to know as much about his own parrot as he thought he did...</p>
