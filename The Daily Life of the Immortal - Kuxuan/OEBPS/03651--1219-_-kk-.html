  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1219 Mr. Wang Zukang’s Conjecture</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">862 stabbings were done in one second. This kind of hand speed would be difficult to achieve if you are not a top expert. But the problem is... Although Mother Wang is known as the "Mother of Ghost Axes", this is what Mother Wang used back then. It's just a pen name. The real Mother Wang is just an ordinary person.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If you ask Mother Wang to write a resume, the resume must be like this: "Wang Youlan. Female. Lives in the Donghuang Road area. Married. Follows the life of a housewife every day. Rests at 10 o'clock every night. No smoking. Only drinking. Yu Qianchang. Be sure to drink a cup of warm milk before going to bed. Then do 20 minutes of eye exercises. She goes to bed and sleeps until dawn. She is an ordinary woman during the physical training period who will never leave stress and fatigue for the next day."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">My thoughts returned to Mr. Wang Zukang's class. Wang Ling felt that this time Mr. Wang Zukang's thinking was completely off track. He was too stubborn to believe that the legendary "Ghost Ax Spirit Mother" was a top master. That led to the blindness at this time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But who is the person who killed Xie Sanxiao? This has become a mystery again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Recently, Lord Diu Lei has been investigating clues about the fake Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Wang Ling feels that we might be able to get some answers from here.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Above the podium, Mr. Wang Zukang is still talking non-stop. Wang Ling feels that Mr. Wang Zukang has completely lost his mind in today's class. However, Wang Ling is not incomprehensible. He finally found it I thought I had gotten some clues about the master I had never met before. The feeling of eagerness to share the joy with everyone was indeed uncontrollable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling could not stop Mr. Wang Zukang from continuing...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmates, the power of the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is self-evident. Who is the evil three smiles? He was very popular back then. Even the old devil may not be his opponent in his heyday. However, he is such a person. He got a second life. Before he could turn into a demon, he was sent back to the west by Ghost Ax Spirit Mother..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang pushed up his old-fashioned glasses and said: "Although the teacher also wants to know what the true face of this ghost spirit mother is. But if you students are interested, maybe you can go to the video game arcade to find it. Answer."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I wonder if any of my classmates like to play video games. If you like to play video games, you will definitely find a game master named Aqian on the rankings recently."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This person broke multiple game records in just one day. Especially for the whack-a-mole machine. That kind of hand speed is unprecedented...it is comparable to Ghost Ax Spirit Mother's record of 862 stabs per second. If The teacher guessed right. This person is Ghost Ax Spirit Mother herself!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Having said this, Wang Ling suddenly felt speechless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang’s conjecture...is completely off track!!!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Mr. Wang Zukang mentioned "Aqian". This also caused a heated discussion in the whole class.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Arcade?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Aqian? So it's him..." Chen Chao said in awe: "This man is very strong! He even broke the shooting record I have always maintained!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who is Forrest Gump? Which one is sweet? Which one is sweet?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's not the Aqian from Forrest Gump! It's dry! It's clean! It's dry!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Chen Chao said this, his pupils suddenly shrank slightly and he looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After a few seconds, he looked away from Wang Ling again...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Chen Chao did not place the suspicion on himself in the end.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But sometimes it has to be said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling really has the urge to kill Chen Chao...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The truth about Ghost Ax Spirit Mother. Except for Wang Ling and a few people from the Divine Realm, no one in the class knows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang spoke cheerfully, but most of the people in the class just listened to the excitement.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A class ended. Mr. Wang Zukang was in a good mood. Not long after he returned to his desk and sat down, a summons from the principal's office turned into a shining stream of light and flew from a distance. This light exploded in front of his eyes. It turns into little bits of powder. It looks particularly dazzling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen’s call?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang stood up immediately.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal's Office. Principal Chen's expression looks very serious. It stands to reason that Number 60 High School won the national competition. Principal Chen should be the happiest person.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, with this expression now, it is obviously not normal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Old Chen. What's the matter with your constipated expression?" Mr. Wang Zukang was not polite. He sat directly on the mahogany chair beside him and poured himself a cup of tea. As a teacher at Number 60 High School Backbone. He doesn't need to stick to small details like etiquette in front of the principal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen took a deep breath and expressed his distress: "Yi Zhiyang's injury is more serious than imagined."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is he that guy from Jian Shen Academy?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang raised his eyebrows. This is General Yi's adopted son. Even if he is injured, the arrangement of medical resources will not be bad.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Physical injuries can naturally be healed, but psychological injuries are a bit difficult." Principal Chen sighed. He turned the magic ball on his desk. The image of Yi Zhiyang was projected into the void. The whole person is covered like a mummy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The best treatment method has been used. If the gauze is removed tomorrow, the whole person will look brand new. But..." At this point, Principal Chen changed the angle of the picture again. He isolated the eyes of Yi Zhiyang. enlarge.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In an instant, Mr. Wang Zukang understood what had happened to White Hair.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sharp and arrogant look in this young man's eyes on the field has disappeared. Now he looks a little dull.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is this... autistic after being beaten?" Mr. Wang Zukang was immediately stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Worse than autism."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen said: "According to President Qi's judgment, Yi Zhiyang is suffering from a kind of stress psychological trauma. It is also known as the invasion of pseudo-inner demons."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The so-called invasion of pseudo-inner demons means that it will not occur in the short term. But as time goes by, the souls of those affected will be devoured step by step. In the end, it will completely fail. It may even lead to blackening... The longest incubation period can even be several years.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because it is impossible to judge the degree of soul devouring at each stage, psychological treatment cannot be as crude as treating the invasion of inner demons. Otherwise, it will have the opposite effect.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The intervention is too superficial. It cannot be eradicated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the intervention is too deep, the disease may be cured, but the person will become a fool.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. This is more troublesome than the real invasion of inner demons.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Have you seen President Qi?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"President Qi's intervention ability is too strong. In fact, this matter is not suitable for President Qi to do personally. In the final analysis, Yi Zhiyang will become like this. We also have certain responsibilities."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, Principal Chen revealed the difficulties he is currently facing: "The best treatment plan currently given by psychologists is that we hope we can convince the classmate Sun Rong to compete with Yi Zhiyang and then have a holiday. race."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This...Huaguo Shui Lian Group can agree?" Mr. Wang Zukang was surprised.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So I'm looking for you to find a solution, right?" Principal Chen looked helpless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On one side are the investors and school directors of Number 60 High School. On the other side is General Yi's Jian Shen College...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">No matter who it is between the two, Principal Chen doesn't want to offend.</p>
