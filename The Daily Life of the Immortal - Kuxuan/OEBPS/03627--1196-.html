  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1196 The legendary Counter</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It combines the three spells of Heavenly Dao chessboard, Douzhuanxingzhi and Wanxiangchen. It recombines the fourteenth-level new sealing technique of the new city. Wang Ling calls it {Heavenly Dao Shifting chess}.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When the chess pieces collide and hit the target.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The power of the yin and yang seal is enough to crush any living thing within the solar system.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, simple permutation and combination obviously did not work for Wang Ying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The other party's calculation speed is much faster than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the battle had just begun. Wang Ling did not lose its position because of the failure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With a variety of powerful powers, he has enough confidence in any battle. And the most important thing is that this duel with Wang Ying takes place in the universe.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Their fighting distance is far from the earth. Even if they let go of some hands and feet, innocent people will not be harmed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is precisely because of this that Wang Ling appears to be extremely patient.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Since Wang Ying was separated from his body, Wang Ling felt that it was actually necessary to investigate the cause of Wang Ying's formation through this battle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All this time. Wang Ling has ignored his own shadow.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He never expected that his shadow would actually grow with him. He would gradually gain spiritual intelligence and have the idea of separating from his true body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wang Ling. You'd better not underestimate my deduction ability! There may be no obvious difference between you and me, but my arithmetic must be better than yours!" Wang Ying said this. But it made Wang Ling's expression slightly stunned. He was thinking about what the differences between himself and Wang Ying were except for their hair color.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Do you have mathematical ability...Wang Ling thinks that his mathematics is not too bad. At least the idea of solving the problem is very clear. Dozens of different solutions can be generated in one second.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For Wang Ling, the only difficulty is how to make the mistakes less obvious when doing the questions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for what Wang Ying said, his arithmetic ability is better than his. Wang Ling actually showed an expression that he was willing to hear the details.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So the next second, Wang Ling heard the soul torture from Wang Ying: "Wang Ling. Let me ask you! Do you know how many packages of crispy noodles you have eaten until today!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest. This question stunned Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because no one would deliberately plan to eat crispy noodles...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have long expected that you would use this way of rearranging and combining spells to deal with me! So a long time ago, I was practicing my arithmetic skills and patience! Every packet of crispy noodles you eat. I I remember them all clearly..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying's eyes showed a determined look: "You are 16 years old this year! You have eaten a total of 36,872 packs of dry noodles! On average, you eat 6 packs a day! Sometimes you eat 20 packs a day!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you know Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying smiled bitterly: "I even know yourself better than you do..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling silently.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was truly speechless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He originally thought that his shadow was just a "repeater", possessing all the abilities he knew.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But I never expected that Wang Ying was not only a "repeater" but also a legendary "counter".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it was finally thanks to Wang Ying. Wang Ling finally knew how many packs of crispy noodles he had eaten...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Opponents usually die from talking too much.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">During the time that Wang Ying was nagging, Wang Ling had already figured out a new offensive method.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knew that the ultimate purpose of Wang Ying chattering in front of him was to delay time so that Senluo Wanxiangzhu would have enough time to extract the spiritual power of the Sun Spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Wang Ying has no chance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next move will definitely seal the victory.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For a long time, many people have been pursuing the power of the Dao. The so-called power of the Dao is the supreme supernatural power that can reach the heaven and the earth. Take Heavenly Dao as an example. There are three thousand Heavenly Dao in a cosmic environment. Combined into three thousand Heavenly Dao .</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Many cultivators on the earth have been pursuing for hundreds or even thousands of years before they can realize one of the three thousand Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A large part of the reason why the power of Tao is difficult to reach is because "Dao" has an ever-changing power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just like the gene sequence in the process of biological evolution. There are no less than trillions of permutations and combinations. Only through repeated learning and a certain amount of luck can we have the opportunity to combine the "gene sequence" of Three Thousand Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And this process may take a cultivator a long time...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment. Wang Ling takes action again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just like before, he didn't form any seals and didn't make any big movements on his body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Another extremely perfect Muyin spell.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The disorienting effect brought by Muyin spellcasting is excellent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because the opponent will never know when the attack will start. It can't even be seen through the opponent's seals to see what kind of skills are used.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying squinted his eyes and tried his best to identify Wang Ling's moves. He was observing Wang Ling's micro-expressions. He relied on his familiarity with Wang Ling to pre-read Wang Ling's next move. Take action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facial paralysis. Also has micro-expressions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sometimes even a tiny blink of an eye may hide a huge amount of information.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling This move is still inspired by the stars in the universe. However, the fusion spells are far more than the first time. His first time he only fused 3 moves. The result was quickly calculated and deduced by Wang Ying Come out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this time. Wang Ling didn't believe that Wang Ying could see through it so quickly after integrating 30 spells.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Wang Ying was surrounded by thousands of meteorites, he felt as if his body had become the center of gravity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Each of these meteorites flying in the sky was like a magnet, rushing towards him in an endless stream. While Wang Ying struggled to escape the traction of the meteorites, he was thinking about what kind of attack Wang Ling had cast. Spells.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In less than a few seconds, Wang Ying felt that her body was getting heavier and heavier!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If this continues, he will definitely lose this battle!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When thousands of meteorites poured over him like a wave, Wang Ying gradually got lost among them, and finally sank.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Did it succeed?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stared at the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He saw that Wang Ying had been completely buried.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This move is a newly created fifteenth-level spell.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Can transform any living being into a star core.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Once the transformation is completed, all the meteorites in the universe will approach the body of the "star core" and gather into a ball. Under the influence of continuous gravity, they will get bigger and bigger. The effect is like a greedy snake.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The most important thing is that as the meteorites gather and their size continues to grow, the people who are transformed into star cores will also bear the same pressure!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Until the end. It will be completely transformed into a brand new planet... and will be trapped in it forever.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the results, Wang Ying should be trapped.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Is that the only extent?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stared at the brand new planet formed by the continuous flow of meteorites. He was sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But at the next moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sphere that was originally motionless in front of me suddenly split open from above with a huge roar...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wang Ling. I will never be abandoned by you again!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ying's voice came from the crack: "I have been your shadow for so long! This time, I will turn you into my shadow forever!"</p>
