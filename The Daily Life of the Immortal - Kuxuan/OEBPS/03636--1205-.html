  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1205 I. Yi Zhiyang. Invincible under Golden Core!</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The fusion of human and sword often depends on the characteristics of the sword spirit. Not all sword spirits and sword masters will transform after merging. As a girl sword spirit whose true body is a cute girl. The fusion of two girls When we are together, we naturally have to consider the issue of dressing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. When Sun Rong also "fused the sword and the human into one", her school uniform immediately transformed into a luxurious blue dress.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For a while, many people's pupils shrank. Unexpectedly, Sun Rong actually turned into a magical girl-like existence...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After a few breaths, the duel officially began. The azure blue dress on her body seemed to hinder Sun Rong's movement. But in fact, the girl's movement speed was far beyond everyone's imagination. The azure blue dress on her body The long skirt is a coat made of Aohai's psychic energy. It is not a real entity...it can actually be atomized when necessary!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">During the leap, the gorgeous long skirt created a gorgeous ripple in the air. Sun Rong punched Yi Zhiyang. But this punch was not an ordinary punch!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She wrapped Aohai's "Sword Intent" around her fist!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So this punch is no longer a fist, but a sword!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The attack range is actually wider than it appears.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang felt his internal organs shake. After the Sun Rong in front of him merged with Aohai, the aura of the attack hit his face like a tsunami.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The spirit sword can form a sword spirit. This proves that the bond between the sword master and the spirit sword has reached a certain level. The swordsman who activates the sword spirit may not be a master. But the swordsman who does not even have a sword spirit has only a few attainments in swordsmanship. It can be described as worrying. Sun Rong can activate the sword spirit in the Foundation Building stage. This is enough to prove Sun Rong's attainments in swordsmanship.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Therefore, Yi Zhiyang knew from the beginning that Sun Rong was an excellent opponent. But even so, he still didn't expect that Sun Rong could actually do this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facing the jab from Sun Rong, Yi Zhiyang did not dodge. The expression on his face was calm and composed. The white school uniform reflected a brilliant light.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, a bright shadow appeared behind him. This was the sword spirit of Yi Zhiyang's "Yangli Sword"! It turned out to be a man whose face could not be seen clearly. His whole body was shining with holy light!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In an instant, everyone around them understood. This was a battle between water and fire!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang summoned his sword spirit Yangli to appear. This is not simply the manifestation of the sword spirit. It is the embodiment of "sword spirit resonance"! This is another level of realm after the human sword merges into one!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is simply a fusion of human and sword. It can only add the combat power of the sword spirit to itself. It also enjoys the effect of sword energy protecting the body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for those who resonate with the sword spirit, they can freely put the sword energy into use. Freely integrate it into every part of their body. Even if they pull out a hair, it can make the hair become extremely sharp, as sharp as iron. Sharp weapon!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Yi Zhiyang completed the "Sword Intent Resonance", everyone around him was in an uproar. Even the principals in the command center could not sit still and stood up one after another.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Genius! Real genius!" A principal couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Jian Shen Academy actually produced such a person? Can he resonate with the sword at such a young age?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The principals were not without reason.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sword Intent Resonance is a very high level in swordsmanship practice. Practitioners in the Nascent Soul stage may not be able to achieve this step, let alone students in the Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Having learned "Sword Resonance" at such a young age, Yi Zhiyang will undoubtedly become a master swordsman in the future...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The previous private discussion between Mr. Huang and President Qi was unknown to the principals. Now after seeing Yi Zhiyang exerting the power of "Sword Intention Resonance", everyone began to speculate about Yi Zhiyang's true identity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It would be great if such a seedling could be found in our hands..." a principal sighed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You want to poach someone?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Jian Shen College is a newly opened school and not very well-known. If we can extend an olive branch, we may not be able to refuse it."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What you think is beautiful. Do you know who is behind the scenes of Jian Shen College..." An insider laughed bitterly. After saying this, the principals around him fell silent for an instant.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">We are all smart people. If there is something, just click on it. In fact, if you think about the principals carefully, you will know how deep the "water" behind this is. Jian Shen College is a newly built school. It has been established for less than 5 years. Time. Such a school is not qualified enough to apply for this national competition in terms of seniority.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So why did Jian Shen College still pass?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This proves that behind the principal of Jian Shen College there may be a very powerful person.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jian Shen...Juggernaut?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The familiar surname makes many principals here stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They all thought of one person...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Could it be..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Have you finally realized it? Your reaction is really slow!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, Yi Zhiyang's attack was finally officially launched after the "Sword Intent Resonance". Astonishing sword energy erupted from all over his body. This sword energy was mixed with the unique scorching energy of Yangli Sword. It was so scorching!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It collided with Sun Rong's sword intent fused in the jab. The two instantly evaporated a scalding mist...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong is indeed very strong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the moment when the swords and intentions intertwined, Yi Zhiyang admired in his heart. At least this was not an opponent he could defeat with one sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With Yi Zhiyang's understanding of the sword, he is now confident that he can defeat all opponents under the Golden Core with one sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But even though he admired Sun Rong in his heart for how strong he was, Yi Zhiyang still hated the outcome of this match.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So during the collision, Yi Zhiyang folded his arms and proudly said something that touched everyone's eardrums.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang: "I. Yi Zhiyang. Invincible under Golden Core."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Invincible under Golden Core!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although these words made many people uncomfortable to hear, they were unable to refute...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He has mastered the power of "Sword Intent Resonance" at such a young age. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is invincible under the Golden Core.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Classmate Sun, you are very strong, but you are not enough to deal with me." Yi Zhiyang always crossed his arms, maintaining his aloof posture. During the collision of swords, Yi Zhiyang just glanced at Sun Rong immediately. She felt a huge pressure coming in front of her! It was as if Apollo, the sun god, was driving a golden chariot towards her at a speed of 280 yards!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Yi Zhiyang actually separated the huge sword intent from his eyes!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No..." Sun Rong frowned slightly. It was impossible for her to choose to confront this powerful sword intention head-on. She made a prompt decision and separated a stream of Aohai's sword intention to block it. The main body chose to withdraw. Avoid the edge.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, a scene that shocked everyone appeared.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Aohai's sword intention was unable to withstand Yang Li's fierce attack. During the collision, Aohai's sword intention was shattered on the spot!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When everyone came back to their senses, they only found a broken blue spirit sword under Sun Rong's feet... The whole sword. Only the hilt was left!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It is a taboo for a swordsman to break the blade. Student Sun, it's time for you to admit defeat." Yi Zhiyang curled his lips and looked at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong carefully picked up the fragments on the ground one by one. Holding these fragments, there was deep distress in his eyes: "Thank you for your hard work..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Are you talking to your sword spirit? The sword body is broken into pieces. The sword spirit will also die soon." Yi Zhiyang said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Thank you, classmate Yi, for reminding me. This Aohai is indeed broken. But who told you... I only have one Aohai?" As soon as he finished speaking, the sword intent surged in Sun Rong's body again. It had been annihilated. The aura of Aohai is revived again at this moment!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Your Aohai..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's right. My Aohai is not dead. I have never revealed this in front of anyone." Sun Rong smiled slightly: "The so-called Aohai. does not represent just a spiritual sword. Aohai. In fact, we are a girl group! One of them just broke. I still have 47 in my hand! And each one has a sword spirit!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone: "..."</p>
