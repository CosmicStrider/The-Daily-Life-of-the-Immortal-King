  <h1>Chapter 31 Samsung Formation Flag </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Watched by a group of astounded people, Wang Ling picked up the cup of tea and knocked it back in a bold and self-assured move.</p>

      <p>He didn't leave a single drop, nor did he puke; instead, he let loose a long belch, the stench of which was so disgusting that Tang Jingze and the others almost threw up.</p>

      <p>Don't misunderstand... Wang Ling didn't intend to act the hero, he just thought that dawdling around like this was a real waste of time.</p>

      <p>Wasting time on such trifles was just disgraceful.</p>

      <p>In comparison, Wang Ling would rather make full use of the time to study.</p>

      <p>The most important reason was that Wang Ling was feeling really worn out after sitting in the bus for so long, when it would have only taken him a few seconds to run from Number 60 High School to Number 59 High School.</p>

      <p>That was why he had never gotten used to public transportation.</p>

      <p>"Student Wang... are you alright?" Teacher Wang had already received one shock after Wang Ling had shown them his small wooden sword last night. He had never thought that the second one would happen so close on the heels of the first.</p>

      <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were flabbergasted; even two pure white feathers drifted down from Er Dan the parrot... how the hell could a human endure a two hundredfold concentration of fruit and vegetable juice?!</p>

      <p>"Mm, I'm used to it..." Wang Ling wiped his mouth calmly and replied with just a few words, like it wasn't a big deal to him at all.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling remembered when he had previously used ancient techniques to concoct body-enhancing potions — those had tasted way more disgusting than this juice. Recalling how in the past, people would choke down a lot of disgusting things for the sake of the smallest progress in cultivation, a two hundredfold concentration of fruit and vegetable juice was really nothing.</p>

      <p>It even tasted a little bit sweet to Wang Ling!</p>

      <p>...Used ...used to it?!</p>

      <p>At Wang Ling's brief four-word reply, an uncontrollable surge of astonishment filled the hearts of everyone present.</p>

      <p>Fruit and vegetable juice was sold cheaply on the market as cultivation nutrients. It could be said that they were developed by Huaguo Water Curtain Group specifically for the lower classes. For impoverished people in particular who had high expectations of their children, this juice was their last hope for a better life.</p>

      <p>As long as one person in the family could break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, they would receive special supplies from the government. For poor households, this would significantly improve their quality of life.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong had been to Wang Ling's home. She knew that it was located in a mixed rural and urban zone right on the fringes of Star city. She had never thought, however, that his family was truly that poor, until he had showed them his small wooden sword. Adding to that the way he had heroically drained the fruit and vegetable juice in one gulp...</p>

      <p>As a conscientious individual of the rich second generation, Sun Rong felt that she had to show care and concern for Wang Ling's life.</p>

      <p>What kind of boy was he? How was he able to tolerate the taste of the fruit and vegetable juice as a young boy growing up, cultivating step by step to the Foundation Establishment stage through his own efforts, and gain admittance to a downtown high school despite living on the outskirts of the city?</p>

      <p>The team from Number 60 High School was completely stunned...</p>

      <p>Associating this cup of juice with the hard life Wang Ling must have experienced from a young age, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu couldn't help the tears that pooled in their eyes.</p>

      <p>Even Chen Chao and Guo Hao, these strapping young men, were deeply moved.</p>

      <p>"..." If things continued like this, Wang Ling felt he might become one of the next Ten People Who Moved The School <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is modelled on China's "Ten People Who Moved The Nation," which is a national award presented to ten individuals who have made important contributions to society in some way.)</dfn>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>This so-called juice of friendship was certainly another ploy by Tang Jingze and his posse.</p>

      <p>Thanks to it, Sun Rong and the others were finally able to clearly see the nature of this student exchange for what it really was.</p>

      <p>Instead of a pretty-sounding exchange between two schools, it might as well just be Number 59 High School's stage for blatantly showing themselves off.</p>

      <p>It not only satisfied their vanity but also let them witness how other schools made fools of themselves.</p>

      <p>"Luckily Classmate Wang is with us! Otherwise we wouldn't even have passed the first hurdle." Sun Rong sighed silently.</p>

      <p>This was going to be a tough battle; no matter what, they had to win!</p>

      <p>They were representing the whole of Number 60 High School; whatever challenges they might face, they would not be crushed!</p>

      <p>Casting an irate look at the stupefied Tang Jingze and his company, Lin Xiaoyu said resentfully, "Our Classmate Wang Ling has drunk this 'testament to friendship,' can we enter now?" The Number 60 High School team was now crystal clear on the fact that this so-called friendship was nothing more than shit... from the start, this boat of friendship had never left the dock!</p>

      <p>"So he is Wang Ling..." Looking at his calm face, Tang Jingze remained silent for a while as he repeated this name over and over in his mind. He had to be on guard against this person in their later plots.</p>

      <p>In just a few seconds, Tang Jingze had already considered many issues one after another, including the next few rounds of "special treatment" for their guests.</p>

      <p>After all, the fruit and vegetable juice had only been just one of them.</p>

      <p>"These distinguished guests from Number 60 High School must be tired after a long trip. Please follow me, I'll help register you." Tang Jingze plastered a fake smile on his face as he showed them in.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling followed at the back of the group as always. No sooner had they started up the stairs than they had to listen to Tang Jingze brag about the newly set-up spirit gathering arrays at Number 59 High School. "As you all know, the renovation of our Number 59 High School's teaching building was successfully completed last year thanks to the great efforts of our new director of the school board..."</p>

      <p>"New director?"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao smirked. "Is that the head of the men's hospital which specializes in circumcision?"</p>

      <p>"Puhahahahaha!"</p>

      <p>Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu burst into laughter in spite of themselves.</p>

      <p>The heavy, wicked sound caused Tang Jingze and his posse to sink into a dead silence.</p>

      <p>Fuck... this wasn't supposed to happen! Wasn't this group supposed to be furious with envy and hate? Why did it feel like they had already taken two arrows to the knee from the Number 60 High School group <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>("And then I took an arrow to the knee" is a line from the game Skyrim which became a popular meme.)</dfn>

      <p>"Student Guo, think twice before you speak!" Teacher Wang pretended to clear his throat in a dignified manner, but was secretly chuckling inside. Everyone was young once, and catfights amongst the young were the most fun to watch! In fact, what he enjoyed most was seeing two girls pulling at each other's hair and rolling around on the ground — now that was exciting to watch!</p>

      <p>"Yes teacher, it was my fault." Guo Hao was worthy of his reputation — he was well-known for this brazenness in Number 60 High School. He would acknowledge his mistake... while looking not the slightest bit repentant.</p>

      <p>"Mm, a fault confessed is already half-redressed. Next time when someone else is speaking, don't interrupt, is that understood?" Teacher Wang nodded, then looked in Tang Jingze's direction. "Alright, what was Student Tang saying just now? Do go on."</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "..." Teacher Wang's words were yet another stabbing pain to the knee. Even you as the teacher-in-charge didn't listen to anything I just said!</p>

      <p>He could only endure the humiliation, and continue showing off...</p>

      <p>The corners of Tang Jingze's mouth pulled down as he held back his anger and repeated himself.</p>

      <p>"As you all know, the renovation of our Number 59 High School's teaching building was successfully completed last year thanks to the great efforts of the new director of the school board. Our eight-story teaching building now has a spirit gathering array installed on every floor. After entering the building, can everyone feel the boundless spirit energy around us, and even how the air is much cleaner and fresher?"</p>

      <p>"Really?" Chen Chao tried gathering spirit energy and letting it run through his body, after which he furrowed his brow. "Strange, I feel nothing special."</p>

      <p>Assuming this was jealousy, Tang Jingze was about to retort, only to see Sun Rong shake her head. "There really is nothing, it's no different to the spirit energy outside."</p>

      <p>Fang Huaqing nudged Tang Jingze gently. "President, is there something wrong with the spirit gathering arrays?"</p>

      <p>Something wrong? How could that be possible, the spirit gathering arrays were checked daily; how could something happen to them so easily?</p>

      <p>"Have they been deactivated? Go and check!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze almost forgot himself as he yelled at Liang Wei and the other two behind him.</p>

      <p>At this critical moment, how could something go wrong? He was only halfway through showing off!</p>

      <p>A moment later, Liang Wei hurried back breathlessly. "President..."</p>

      <p>"What the hell is going on?"</p>

      <p>"A teacher from the engineering department said that the core formation flags for the spirit gathering arrays exploded for unknown reasons, all eight of them..."</p>

      <p>"..." At the news, it felt like ten thousand grass mud horses were galloping through Tang Jingze's mind.</p>

      <p>Twice now, he had actually been smacked right in the face by his pretentious ploys!</p>

      <p>In that moment, Tang Jingze felt unbelievable pain in his knee.</p>

      <p>Guo Hao laughed his head off. "HAHAHA a core formation flag can actually explode? This is the first time I've heard of it. Seems like the quality of your formation flag wasn't much, don't tell me it was manufactured by Samsung <sup>3</sup> ?"</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is a reference to the major issue which Samsung had with several of their device models exploding)</dfn>

      <p>The greatest pain was not being pierced in the knee, but that when a person was already down in agony, Guo Hao gave the knife a final twist.</p>

      <p>Crack ! —</p>

      <p>It was as if everyone present could already hear Tang Jingze's knee shattering.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Standing innocently at the back of the crowd, Wang Ling cast a gloomy look at Number 59 High School's grand eight-story teaching building and heaved a deep sigh.</p>

      <p>It looked like the strength of the talisman seal on his arm had weakened even further. In the past, his spirit energy would certainly impact the magnetic field of a spirit gathering array, but not to the point of destroying its core formation flag. Now that the power of the talisman seal was steadily deteriorating, it was becoming increasingly harder to contain himself.</p>

      <p>Of course, Wang Ling was doing his utmost to restrain himself.</p>

      <p>But he couldn't do anything about the overflow of his spirit energy, especially now that the talisman seal was steadily deteriorating.</p>

      <p>The pitiful one was that circumcision director of the school board; setting up eight consecutive spirit gathering arrays would have cost an arm and a leg.</p>

      <p>And now they had all exploded... even Wang Ling couldn't guess how many foreskins the director would have to cut to recoup the loss.</p>
