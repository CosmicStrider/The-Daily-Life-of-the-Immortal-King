  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1256 The identity of the destiny bit</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for the speculation about the messenger of destiny. Zhuo Yi actually has his own answer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are only a handful of people in this world who know the {Wuji Sword}. And there are even fewer people who know this Sword and can use it skillfully.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the proficiency of the destiny messenger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His understanding of the {Wuji Sword} has reached a superb level. He has the skill of raising his hand to cast instantly. Except for the Sword Master, Zhuo Yi really cannot think of anyone else with such proficiency.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Yi Zhiyang also demonstrated this Sword in the National Taishu Competition.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the gap between just getting started and mastering it still exists.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Therefore. After ruling out the possibility that the messenger of destiny is Yi Zhiyang, Zhuo Yi can only think of one person at present.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai folded his arms and blew slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Bang! A sound.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The fortune-telling mask of the messenger of destiny suddenly cracked and turned into powder.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After seeing the other party's face clearly, Zhuo Yi took a deep breath.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's really you."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Four short words. It has been proved that Zhuo Yi's idea is completely correct.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sword immortal Van Rui.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The man who claimed to be dead back then left behind a lot of mysteries.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, the Office of Strategic Deception has also obtained some evidence proving that Jian Immortal is not dead.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At that time Zhuo Yi had the basic inference.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Back then, Jian Immortal Fan Rui put on a big show to help his disciples get rid of their inner demons.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And for many years, the only insider, namely the evil swordsman Yi Jianchuan, the senior brother of Xie Jian Shen, has been keeping this secret.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After that, the sword immortal Van Rui disappeared completely.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was like a cloud of smoke that evaporated from the world. He disappeared without a trace.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi The last time I saw the sword immortal Fan Rui, it was in a book called "History of Cultivation Sword".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He saw the black and white photo of the sword Immortal Van Rui registered in the history book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Unexpectedly, many years later, I would see myself in person. And in such a situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I didn't expect that you would join the foundation after disappearing for so many years." Zhuo Yi sighed. He was filled with emotion.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He saw Jian Immortal Fan Rui's embarrassed appearance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I really can’t think of an immortal swordsman who has cultivated a sword master. Why would he choose to join the foundation?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Go help the tyrants do evil. Do those despicable things.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi has many questions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He even wanted to curse directly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he opened his mouth, but in the end he said nothing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He thought of what Fan Rui said to him before the battle, "He is fighting for himself."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then his real purpose of joining the foundation seems a bit intriguing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have my own reasons...you won't understand." Fan Rui stood up. His entire right arm had been cut off. There was blood all over the floor.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The gurgling blood donations gathered at his feet and formed a pool of blood. The amount of bleeding was astonishing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I just ask you to return that bamboo to me and let me complete the final attack." At this time, Fan Rui said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you know what this means?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I will die."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sword Immortal Fan Rui smiled and said: "I had calculated that there would be this battle hundreds of years ago. For this reason, I must join the foundation. But I didn't expect that the owner of the best sword in the world would be you..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Then you misunderstood. I don't have the ability to become his master." Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly. He winked at Jingbai. Jingbai snorted. With a flick of his fingertips, the bamboo sword directly It flew back and landed heavily at Fan Rui's feet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Whether it's you or not, I still thank you for giving me the opportunity to challenge."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fan Rui picked up "Yu" again with his left hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was grateful. Thanks to Zhu Jian for accompanying him through such a journey.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, Fan Rui also knew very well that his behavior was not understandable to ordinary people.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it doesn't matter anymore. He has always been fighting for himself.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Jian Immortal took a deep breath. He was ready for the final impact.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"{Wuji Sword} is fully activated!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As soon as he finished speaking, powerful sword energy surged out from Jian Immortal's body,</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For a time, Fan Rui was the center.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The surrounding ground was impacted by the sword energy, leaving dozens of deep ravines. The sword energy was almost overwhelming, like a tsunami rolling over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Such an amazing equivalent. It surprised Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The man in front of him was indeed as strong as the history textbook he had read... without any exaggeration.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this is very strong. It is only limited to the strength above the earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">No matter how powerful the aura of the sword Immortal Fan Rui is, it is still just a drop in the ocean compared to Jingbai.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, he roared and rushed forward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The speed was as fast as lightning. In a short period of time, Fan Rui used the blessing of {Wuji Sword} to turn the bamboo sword in his hand into thousands!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He actually turned the sword's intention into a thousand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Zhuo Yi was filled with only wonder.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If Jingbai hadn't been here, even if his reservoir was fully open, he might not be Fan Rui's opponent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facing the thousands of bamboo swords that were about to attack him, Jingbai just waved his sleeves and waved a sword barrier to block the front.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The brown psychic sword barrier turned into a solid shield. It blocked the thousands of bamboo swords and prevented Fan Rui from getting even half a step closer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A huge disparity in strength still exists.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If you continue like this, you will die from the backlash." Jingbai looked at the man in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, he didn't quite understand the other party's behavior, like a moth flying toward a flame.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Maybe. For someone who has been chasing Sword all his life, dying under his first sword in the world is also a kind of romance?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His face was expressionless with shock.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He acted as ordered. He showed no mercy to Fan Rui.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, Fan Rui was also struggling to use the bamboo sword in his hand, trying to take a step forward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The tip of his sword stretches forward at a rate of several millimeters. It can almost be described as minimal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo YiIt’s unclear what purpose Fan Rui came here with.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As time went by, he saw that Sword Immortal Fan Rui's body began to be unable to withstand the pressure of the sword barrier and collapsed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Starting from the fingertips of his left hand, it turned into powder little by little.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have won this battle..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A few seconds later, Fan Rui laughed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This man completely disappeared between heaven and earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it wasn't until this moment that the shocked white pupils shrank.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He already understood the real purpose of Fan Rui's challenge to him like Kuafu Zhuri...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"In a sense, it is true." He said with a blank expression.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Lord Jingbai, what does this mean?" Zhuo Yi was puzzled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Fan Rui obviously has a stronger Sword. But why does he keep using his disciple's famous skills in battles?" Jingbai said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This point wakes up Zhuo Yi a bit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Indeed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As an immortal sword, Fan Rui's own Sword is also unique.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in all his attacks just now, he used General Yi's original {Wuji Sword}.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There must be a deep meaning in this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"As far as the Sword is concerned. This is truly a lunatic."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai made the final evaluation of Fan Rui's behavior.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He never expected that Fan Rui would actually take advantage of him in turn. By challenging him, the world's best swordsman, he would merge himself with {Wuji Sword} and become the meaning of Sword of {Wuji Sword}...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In other words. After Van Rui's challenge of seemingly "flying into a flame" is over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">{Wuji Sword} has also officially become the Sword branch in Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">From the very beginning, Fan Rui came here with this purpose in mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After listening to Jingbai's explanation, Zhuo Yi suddenly understood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This may be Fanrui's Sword to prove himself.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, he also made his final contribution for his disciples and grandchildren...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This messenger of destiny for the Foundation fell like this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Zhuo Yi knows. The battle is not over yet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"President Bai. I know you are already here. Come out."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time. Zhuo Yi turned his gaze in one direction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the void, a young man with an evil face stepped out of the crack with slightly curled lips...</p>
