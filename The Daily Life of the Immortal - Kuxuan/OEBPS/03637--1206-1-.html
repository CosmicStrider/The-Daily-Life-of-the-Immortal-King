  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1206 A battle with money</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As Sun Rong took out the second Aohai in public and once again performed the "human sword integration" operation, the audience in the venue took a breath of air-conditioning - it seems. This is not only a battle between water and fire. Competition. Or a competition between money.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A principal in the command center was shocked by Sun Rong's arrogance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Are these twin sword spirits?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No. I guess it should be twin sword spirits and cloned sword spirits. With the wealth of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group, it should not be difficult to entrust the spirit sword company to repeatedly clone the spirit swords and then the sword spirits. In other words, these 48 swords In Aohai, classmate Sun Rong owns two original spirit swords. The other 46 are clones."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Then the current one seems to be a clone too?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's right. The main spirit sword should not be used as a last resort. Classmate Sun Rong will not use it easily."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Many principals could tell at a glance that the first Aohai and the second one that Sun Rong had just sacrificed were clone swords.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although the cloned sword spirit is created based on the original body, in fact there is still a certain difference in the comprehensive properties between the cloned sword spirit and the original body. This is why the cloned sword spirit is so easy to break.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The second round of the showdown is here. The suspense is not over yet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Yi Zhiyang's claim that he is invincible under the Golden Core sounds arrogant, he does have the capital to clamor for it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, under Golden Core, Sun Rong's combat power is not weak.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can be said that Yi Zhiyang from Jian Shen College and Sun Rong from Number 60 High School. This is a competition that can represent the top level among the younger generation of contemporary cultivators.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Many people never thought that such a wonderful battle would take place. The principals in the command center secretly regretted not opening a market before... The purpose of opening the market was not for money. What the principals were betting on was their ability to recognize people. If anyone can guess the outcome of the game, it can be used as a conversation piece later.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who do you think will win?" At this time, Mr. Huang, who was sitting at the front, laughed. He could feel that the principals behind him were a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, there are clear regulations on the opening of the market. No matter the rules, procedures, regulations and laws, it is actually not allowed. So Mr. Huang thought of a reason: "Anyone who guesses correctly will be rewarded."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Huang’s reward?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, many principals showed interest in their eyes. Everyone knew who Mr. Huang was. Naturally, the reward given was not an ordinary object. Some principals heard that Mr. Huang had refined various items in the stalactite cave over the years. A small amount of elixir. I have expectations for this reward in my heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If you assume that the prize is an elixir, you will make a lot of money!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Teacher, I would like to ask, student, what is the reward?" President Qi next to him narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"A round thing." Huang Lao replied.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After hearing Mr. Huang's description, the principals were even more certain that the prize was the elixir. So they began to express their opinions in the audience. In order to facilitate President Qi's statistics, the principals established a group chat face to face and shared their opinions on this battle. Post your opinions in the group in the form of text. Just wait for the results to come out. It will be clear at a glance who will get the reward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yi Zhiyang has realized the resonance of the sword at such a young age. His swordsmanship is extraordinary. And when I watch the battle, he is neither arrogant nor impetuous, his thoughts are clear, and his explosive power is extremely strong. If I just learned from Sun Rong It's not a sacrifice of the spiritual sword. I'm afraid the protective golden light has already been triggered."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Huh. What's the use of having strong explosive power? The so-called nine times a night. The explosive power is also very strong. But after all, there is an upper limit. I don't believe that with such a strong explosive power, the battery life can be so strong. He can beat his classmates Sun Rong is a spiritual sword. And Sun Rong still has forty-seven of them... Are you going to fight classmate Sun Rong with your head? I bet classmate Sun Rong will win! "</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Here, the principals began to have a heated debate about the results of the second round of the showdown. The real excitement on the field was even more intense than that of the principals in the command center.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhu Hanyun was defeated. He was sitting cross-legged next to Chen Chao with bruises all over his body. Although he looked seriously injured, it was just a skin injury. Previously, the teacher of the special team wanted to take Zhu Hanyun away from the scene for treatment, but Nan Yixiu declined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, after Zhu Hanyun's repeated requests, Zhu Hanyun was finally allowed to stay at the scene with the consent of the command center. The premise was that Zhu Hanyun could not cause trouble. Otherwise, the consequences would be serious.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhu Hanyun has already thought clearly about this peak showdown under the Golden Core. If he can't observe and learn from up close, I'm afraid he will regret it for the rest of his life!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhu Hanyun smiled and asked Chen Chao next to him: "Who do you think will win?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I will always support classmate Sun Rong!" The expression on Chen Chao's face was very relaxed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You have to analyze it without adding personal feelings. I think Yi Zhiyang will win."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhu Hanyun's mouth twitched. He began to regret asking Chen Chao this question. Then he turned to look at Nan Yixiu beside him: "Brother Nan, what do you think?" He asked the person from Number 60 High School in this situation. Obviously it doesn't make sense. Even if they know that Yi Zhiyang is very strong, they will still choose to support their captain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I think Yi Zhiyang wins."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Heroes think alike."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The two looked at each other. Zhu Hanyun then analyzed the next game: "If Yi Zhiyang enters the next round, then the possibility of you fighting Yi Zhiyang is very high."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Ha. If we lose to Yi Zhiyang, I will be convinced." Nan Yixiu smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao next to him was not happy when he heard this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What does it mean for Yi Zhiyang to advance to the next round? There is a high possibility that Nan Yixiu will play against him? Doesn't this assume that Wang Ling has already lost to Nan Yixiu?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, many people at Number 60 High School cast disdainful looks.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the president of the Wang Ling fan club, Xia Ming was the first to stand up: "Classmate Nan Yixiu is a little overconfident. Why do you assume that classmate Wang Ling will lose to you?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nan Yixiu hehe: "Let me tell you. The gap in combat power is indeed obvious."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chen Chao also chuckled: "Then I have something to say. The difference in luck value is also obvious. Our school's mascot is not in vain. I think you may not win!" This is Chen Chao's sincere words. No It doesn’t contain any utilitarian milk ingredients. From the very beginning of Nan Yixiu’s duel with Wang Ling. I don’t know why Chen Chao felt at ease.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt that if it was Wang Ling, he might be able to win by surprise with a certain probability.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although there may be a real gap in combat effectiveness as Nan Yixiu said. But Chen Chao is willing to believe Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The debate ends here. After Sun Rong replaced the clone spirit sword, the battle with Yi Zhiyang finally started again! Since the opponent can freely use the sword intention on various parts of the body, it is obvious that he will face a hard attack. The one who suffers must still be the loser. Own.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment. Sun Rong changed his fighting ideas.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl was still wearing a gorgeous blue dress. She shouted softly and stretched out her left hand. Another blue spiritual sword emerged from her hand - this is the third Aohai!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You can actually use two swords?" On the other side of the battle, Yi Zhiyang's pupils shrank slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In his opinion. Sun Rong Even if he uses his two swords, it will be of no avail.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Offering more means means breaking more.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In Yi Zhiyang's eyes, this cloned Aohai is as crispy as Wangwang crushed ice.</p>
