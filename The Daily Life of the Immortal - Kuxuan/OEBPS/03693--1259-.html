  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1259 The Great Lord of the Void</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xu Bai still had the last two heads left.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For Xu Bai, these are also his last two lives.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If he can block the next two blows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then he may become the man who has been slapped the most by Wang Ling...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, when Wang Ling was slapped for the fourth time, his mood was particularly complicated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He thought to himself that this might be how an adult's heart breaks down.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a cultivator, does Bai Zhe work hard enough?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I'm afraid so.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to pursue a higher realm, he also practiced hard for thousands of years.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to pursue a higher realm, he did not hesitate to betray the boss and kill the boss who had supported him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to pursue a higher realm, he even decided not to be a human being and completely dedicated his soul to the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But what did he get?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Bai Zhe. Bai Zhe... At this moment, Wang Ling is savoring President Bai's real name.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Indeed. In the eyes of Wang Ling, all this is just "a waste of time".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Evil people will be punished by evil people.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">From the perspective of Wang Ling, President Bai's fate was actually determined a long time ago.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In history, any cultivator who does evil things, no matter how high their cultivation level is, their final outcome will not be much better.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Heavenly Dao has reincarnation. Heaven will bypass who."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This sentence is not just talk.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Those cultivators who have committed bad karma will eventually be counterattacked by the bad karma they have committed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling does not intend to give Xu Bai another chance with his fifth palm.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His face remained expressionless when he struck the fourth palm.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What Xu Bai didn't expect was that just when he was calculating where Wang Ling's palm would land on his body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling is about to get close to his palm. It will become huge in an instant.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The huge palm is like the five fingers of Buddha, covering the sky and the sun!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His entire body was covered in an instant!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is everything over?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, Xu Bai has realized that this battle is probably coming to an end.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He simply couldn't avoid Wang Ling's fourth blow.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Obviously he has tried so hard, but he can no longer escape the end of death.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boom!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A palm fell.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After advancing to become "Xu Bai", President Bai once again challenged Wang Ling. He was completely destroyed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling's fourth palm. It's not an ordinary blow.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He combined dozens of Heavenly Dao spells and even used Fate and Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Huge blows were dealt to both the body and the soul!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All this is to ensure that President Bai has been completely eliminated and there is no possibility of resurrection.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This palm of Wang Ling not only eliminated President Bai in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because of the fusion of Fate's power, even President Bai from other parallel worlds were completely destroyed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">From now on, there will be no more Bai Zhe in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The battle was over. Wang Ling sighed secretly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After experiencing President Bai's incident, he felt that he had gained a lot of inspiration.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is nothing wrong in itself as a person trying to make himself better.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But to make yourself better, it must be based on "your own efforts".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sacrifice other people's happiness to make yourself better. This is not called hard work. It is a crime.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He turned around and prepared to step out of the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But at this moment. Wang Ling suddenly discovered a problem that he had missed...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The situation seemed not as simple as he imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This person Bai Zhe has been completely eliminated by him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Whether it is as a virtual spirit or as a human being on Earth, they no longer exist.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Logically speaking, after Bai Zhe is eliminated, the void boundary he is currently in should be lifted on its own.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the limit of the void in front of me still has no intention of disintegrating.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even after death, can the boundaries of the void still be preserved?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling was secretly surprised at how tricky these void creatures were.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, he was the one who fought against Xu Bai just now.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If it were anyone else.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even if he has the ability to deal with Xu Bai, he may not be able to escape from the boundary of the void. Then the problem before Wang Ling now arises.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">How to deal with this void limit? This is a huge problem.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Void limit. This is a domain ability of void creatures.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Since it is a domain ability, it must be related to the world behind the Void Gate.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is nothing we can do."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time. Wang Ling secretly frowned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If this thing is destroyed directly, it will probably form a very terrifying space tide, causing an effect similar to that of a black hole... This will bring huge damage to the city where he lives.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For now, the solution Wang Ling thought of was to send this void boundary back.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Go where it should go.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, Wang Ling raised his swords together and recited the spell silently.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In less than a few seconds, a giant teleportation circle was completed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is one of the branch spells under the Heavenly Dao spell {Great Teleportation}: {Return Technique}. You can designate anything to be returned to the hands of its original owner or even the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Gu Shunzhi should also be familiar with this spell. This is one of the compulsory spells for orderers. It is usually mainly used to correct some time and space distortions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When space-time chaos is formed, the phenomenon of cross-teleportation will occur among creatures in many worlds.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some people will see strange spiritual beasts, vegetation, and even alien creatures that have never appeared in their own world. These phenomena may not be illusions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Buzz!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Thirty seconds later. The transmission begins!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Accompanied by a golden beam of light reaching the sky.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling disappeared directly from Songhai City with the void boundary left by Xu Bai...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The unknown black psychic group inside Number 60 High School has disappeared!" At this time, a small police officer who was evacuating the crowd nearby made a scary voice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The boundary of the void disappeared. The huge sense of oppression also disappeared with it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The crisis was resolved. Some police officers hugged each other. Some simply collapsed on the ground from exhaustion.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The void boundary of Xubai. Although the internal pressure is the greatest, the sense of oppression radiated from the outside is still strong. The cultivators of Golden Core work in such an environment and will suffer a mental breakdown at any time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the more crisis comes, the more they have to step forward!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is their duty!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Protect the lives and property of all cultivators. This is also their mission!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Well done to everyone! Well done to all those who go against the trend!" In this regard, Zhuo Yi, as the temporary commander, encourages all the police officers here who have stepped forward bravely.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He looked in the direction of Number 60 High School. Looking at his alma mater that had completely turned into a pile of ruins. Zhuo Yi felt a little complicated inside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This has been completely dismantled...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seems that tomorrow the engineering team will be able to move in directly to build a new teaching building, pave a new playground, build a new gymnasium, and add the latest spirit gathering array.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, Zhuo Yi is also a little confused.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The limit of the void has disappeared...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Where has his master gone?</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Meanwhile on the other side.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Wang Ling opened his eyes, he already appeared in a world full of light.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is..."Wang Ling looked around expressionlessly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If he guessed correctly, he might have followed the transferred void boundary.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They were sent back to the void world together...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is it you who killed Xu Bai..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, a deep and hollow voice sounded from the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You are?"Wang Ling has no respect.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I am your great Lord of the Void." the voice answered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"..."Wang Ling.</p>
