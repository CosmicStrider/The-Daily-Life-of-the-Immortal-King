  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1190 Dad hits me again</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After understanding Shadow, everyone has different abilities in photography. But Wang Zhen's Shadow was taught and taught by Wang Ling personally. There is no doubt about the power of the ability. When Li Huanran's "Dark Shadows" Wang Zhen could clearly feel the changes in Li Huanran's mental state when he was subjected to the strong male locks of the "tied man".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His mind control effects were successfully overridden!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The originally absent and dull pupils gradually began to focus and turned into normal eyes. Seeing this scene, Wang Zhen felt relieved and released the restraints of the tied man.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facts proved that Er Ha's inference was completely correct. Li Huanran regained consciousness. And all the actions that had occurred due to being out of control were clearly remembered by Li Huanran after he regained consciousness.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His face was filled with shame: "I'm sorry..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's not your fault. You were mind-controlled by criminals."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen stepped forward to comfort him. However, the expression on Li Huanran's face did not improve. He just kept apologizing: "I'm really sorry..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact, Er Ha can understand this feeling very well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, Li Huanran is the queen of a famous family. This is the biological son of Li Xiaokai, the most famous martial artist on the earth at that time! He has been working hard to chase and surpass his father all his life! But now he is practicing hard to better safeguard justice. The power he came from was actually used by illegal forces at such a critical moment. This is absolutely a shame for Li Huanran.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Join us. Let's avenge our shame." At this time, Xiao Yin was also cheering for Li Huanran.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Li Huanran's demonic shadow has no effect on them, it is obvious that the strength of this shadow is still very strong. If Li Huanran can join, their combat power will be even greater.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sorry...Actually, I have a grudge." After a moment, Li Huanran spoke.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You said."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Can you use the transformation technique to look like my father and hit me..." Li Huanran's face showed a look of anticipation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha and Xiao Yin were both shocked when they saw this scene.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hasn’t the effect of the bound man been lifted?!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The two looked at Wang Zhen. Wang Zhen's expression was also extremely horrifying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He swears!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The power of the shadow has indeed been released! Logically speaking, Li Huanran no longer has the attribute of "masochism"...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course. This is absolutely impossible to be the sequelae left by the "tied man".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So the only reasonable explanation is that Li Huanran himself is...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Brother Li...do you usually..." Er Ha stared at Li Huanran and asked cautiously.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Huanran's face was a little red. In fact, he was a little embarrassed about this matter. He had never mentioned it to outsiders. But now, for the sake of the overall situation, Li Huanran decided to speak out bravely: "In the past, when I was depressed, I I would ask my father to give me a slap in the face."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone took a breath of air.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">hiss!--</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Is this still possible?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Could this be the legendary...Dad hit me again?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen patted Li Huanran on the shoulder. He still felt a little emotional in his heart: "Don't worry, brother Li. Leave this matter to me. I'm a few years older than you. I actually understand this feeling very well... ."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You also asked your own father to slap you in order to get back on your feet?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No. It's not just my father who beats me. Sometimes my mother also..." Wang Zhen was speechless. But they had no time to continue discussing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He quickly transformed into the appearance of Master Li Xiaokai. Wang Zhen slapped Li Huanran unceremoniously on the face. Li Huanran's whole body was blown away. He was deeply embedded in the stone wall on the side and carved a humanoid figure. outline.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A few seconds later, Li Huanran slowly walked out, covering his red and swollen face with five fingerprints on the right side. After being slapped by Wang Zhen, his spirit was indeed lifted a lot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The slap looked very heavy, but Wang Zhen spared his hand. Li Huanran only suffered superficial injuries.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Thank you very much. Brother Wang Zhen." After the slap, Li Huanran became familiar with Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This feeling of heroes cherishing heroes. Er Ha feels that only Wang Zhen and Li Huanran can have this kind of synchronized feeling in the world...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When a masochist meets another masochist, it is truly speechless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After pulling Li Huanran into the chat room in the mental space, Wang Zhen used the ability of mental transmission to briefly explain some of the current situations and his own simple guesses.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">While everyone went deep into the third area, they fully exchanged opinions on the current issues.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I didn't expect such a big thing to happen..." Even Li Huanran himself would not have thought that during the period of his death, someone would plan such a large-scale illegal and criminal activity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The universe is made into an array. Use all the planets in the solar system to construct an array...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If the person behind the resurrection really came for this purpose, the opponent's strength is 100% higher than True Immortal!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the vacuum environment of the universe! Even the True Immortal level can only stay for a maximum of 5 minutes! If it exceeds 5 minutes, the blood all over the body will gradually freeze, and eventually turn into a huge piece of human ice, drifting in the universe forever. .</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How much memory do you have left?" Wang Zhen asked in the mental space at this time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Huanran joined their team. This not only brought them new combat power, but also brought new clues! As a resurrector, Wang Zhen earnestly hoped to learn relevant information from Li Huanran. intelligence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I seemed to have been dreaming for a long time. I dreamed that I was born from a flower. It grew rapidly from the embryo... When I landed, I saw a boy with white hair whose appearance was unclear."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Did he say anything to you?" Xiao Yin asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I didn't say anything. I just snapped my fingers and I lost consciousness." Li Huanran knew that from the moment the boy snapped his fingers, he had been controlled by powerful mind control techniques.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xiao Yin: "So. You have had face-to-face contact with the mastermind behind everything."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen shook his head: "No. It's not just Brother Li. I'm afraid all the resurrected people have had direct contact with this man behind the scenes."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm afraid so." Li Huanran nodded: "I remember it was an abandoned factory. There were many snow-white flowers planted on the ground."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Can you describe in detail what the flower looks like?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The rhizome of the flower is thick and long. The small stamens are as big as mochi and the big ones are like basketballs. There is a human-like embryo in the center of the stamen. It is surrounded by white petals. Just inject spiritual energy to quickly ripen the flower. Together with the embryo inside, it can grow rapidly."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Resurrection of life through spiritual grafting?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Zhen was stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had never heard of such a method of resurrection...</p>
