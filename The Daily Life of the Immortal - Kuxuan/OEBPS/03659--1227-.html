  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1227 Behind the Gate of Void</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After listening to Gu Shunzhi's analysis, everyone in the audience nodded. A person of order is a person of order after all. The reason why Gu Shunzhi was favored by Heavenly Dao seems to be reasonable. With just a few words, the clouds were cleared up. solved the mystery. This may be the experience accumulated by the Orderer who has been involved in the disputes between various races in the universe for many years and is responsible for mediating.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But obviously, these current inferences alone are not enough to speculate on the identity of the person behind the scenes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If we want to pretend to be one of them and perform a fierce jump, then we must at least confirm the identity of one of the seven identity cards..." Wang Zhen crossed his arms and stared at the list on the ground. He felt that he had no clue. No clue. Although the cultivation civilization on the earth is far less developed than in the divine realm. But this time being trapped on the earth by Heavenly Dao for experience seems to Wang Zhen to be in the right place.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wherever there are people, there are disputes. The disputes on the earth are no less than those in the divine realm. Although Wang Zhen felt a little aggrieved when he was first trapped here, after getting used to the life here, he even began to like the people on the earth a little bit. Life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Studying with Ling Zhenren is indeed a pleasure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What did Ling Zhenren say?" Wang Zhen then asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The little master is still doing his homework..." Er Ha said this. He couldn't help but glance at Wang Zhen, Gu Shunzhi and other people from the God Realm: "By the way, have you finished your homework?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No." Wang Zhen shook his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha: "Then you are so calm..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time Wang Zhen glanced at Gu Shunzhi: " Old Gu hired a man in the 60th. Every day at 22:00 on the dot, he'll send us the answers to all of the assignments on the paper via staples. Just follow and copy."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Er Ha took a deep breath. Couldn't help but frowned. This study attitude is so bad!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's not that he can't understand...the cultural knowledge on earth is very easy for these big guys from the gods. With Gu Shunzhi's IQ, I'm afraid he will develop solutions that have not yet been developed on earth. If they answer the question according to their habitual thinking, they may expose their true identity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So in this case, Gu Shunzhi chose to hire someone to do the homework, and then copied it himself. Copying the homework is the easiest thing to do... This was done by Gu Shunzhi after he came to Earth, together with Chen Chao and Guo Hao. They learned this from two old fritters who worked from dawn to dusk to copy homework.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course, Gu Shunzhi can only spend money to hire people. He is the orderer. Heavenly Dao pays the salary. Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi are just getting the glory. These two people have now experienced "poverty" "After my baptism, I became very sensitive to all kinds of expenses.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If they didn't know their true identities, who would have thought that one of these two people was the eldest son of the Wang family in the God's Domain, and the other was the eldest daughter of the Liu family?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, several people were staring at the list on the ground and lost in thought. Although they already had Gu Shunzhi's reasoning, they still had no clue about what was going to happen next.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, Zhuo Yi always had a feeling. He felt that the clues Lao Liang left for him should be more than this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, Li Huanran on the side said: "Can I take this list and take a look at it?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What did you find?" Zhuo Yi handed over the list. He could clearly feel that Li Huanran's body was shaking uncontrollably when he took the paper.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is just an ordinary piece of paper. It can actually make Li Huanran so scared.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sorry... I lost my temper..." Li Huanran suppressed the fear in his heart. He held the piece of paper and felt it carefully for a long time. His body was also shaking constantly. In less than a minute, he put his hand Let go. As the paper fell to the ground, Li Huanran also showed an expression of relief.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What's going on?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Everything is as I guessed. This piece of paper has that smell." Li Huanran said: "Everyone should know that I once wanted to forcefully open the door to the void..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What's the connection?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Although I didn't break through the Void Gate at that time, I actually opened a small invisible gap... Now, I can feel that this piece of paper has the same smell as the Void Gate."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everyone was stunned when they heard this. At the same time, Zhuo Yi also showed a surprised expression.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If you follow this statement, then the central breaking point of the incident seems to have been found... There is no doubt that it is the Gate of the Void!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for why Li Huanran couldn't help but tremble with fear when he received this list. This is probably also a symptom of "stress trauma response". Back then, Li Huanran broke through the gate of the void in an attempt to find his father and failed. Face to face The fear brought about by death may have been burned into the depths of his soul like a knife and an axe.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What did you sense and see when you broke down the door?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That should be a...spirit? I can feel an invisible spirit wrapped around my body like gluttons. There are so many of them like locusts. They swarm up, wrap me up, and then start to devour me. , gnawing, tearing my body apart..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Li Huanran's words made everyone here tremble.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Then let's name this creature Void Spirit."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, Zhuo Yi finally saw a clue to the incident. He turned his attention to Gu Shunzhi: "Does Senior Gu know about the Gate of the Void?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Gu Shunzhi is the Orderer. He bounces back and forth between the ten universes all year round. His breadth of knowledge is self-evident. Now that things have taken shape. Zhuo Yi The first thing I thought of was Gu Shunzhi. Get some information.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's a pity. Gu Shunzhi shrugged: "It's a pity. This Gate of the Void is not in the Dao. It is not under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Dao. I, the orderer, are of no use."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There are things in this world that those of order don't know about." Zhuo Yi clicked his tongue.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"To put it bluntly, the Orderer is the envoy sent by Heavenly Dao. In other words, he is just a handyman. The universe is huge. There are many things that are not within the Dao. As Orderers, we can only watch from a distance. We cannot intervene. Otherwise, it will be broken. Rules."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Gu Shunzhi said with a wry smile: "But thanks to the blessing of little friend Li Huanran, this matter finally has some clues. Judging from Li Daoyou's description, there should be something beyond the earth's cultivators behind this Void Gate. Powerful creature. If my guess is correct, the purpose of Keorn coming to Huaxiu 20 years ago was probably to investigate the Void Gate."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The Gate of the Void has only appeared twice in historical records. Once it was challenged by Li Daoyou's father, martial arts master Li Xiaokai. But unfortunately, Master Li only opened the gap that was half a punch away and was swallowed up. And the second time The second time was the second time Daoyou Li opened the door in order to find his father."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Opening the door twice. What does that mean?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I remember a famous scientist on Earth said: Human beings should never try to have equal dialogue with high-level civilizations. At the same time, they must do these four words [do not respond] to all signals sent by high-level civilizations. "</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is a chain of contempt between higher civilizations and lower civilizations. Just like the creatures in the Void Gate. They may not be interested in the earth at all. So the two sides have always been in a state of peaceful coexistence."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"But I guess. This state of peaceful coexistence may have been broken as early as the second time Li Daoyou attacked the door..." Gu Shunzhi said here. His voice gradually became deeper: "If these voids in the Void Gate Ling. began to show interest in the earth. This may be a disaster for human cultivators."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is there any evidence?" Wang Zhen asked at this time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Of course." Gu Shunzhi picked up the list and said, "The answer is in the list that Warden Liang left for us."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Gu Shunzhi gently touched each name on the famous list. At the same time, he was also distractedly observing Li Huanran's reaction. Li Huanran was now like a reaction vessel. He felt a sense of smell in the "Gate of the Void". Natural sensitivity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And when Gu Shunzhi's finger touched the word "judgment", he saw Li Huanran's whole body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's him." Gu Shunzhi said: "It turns out that there are already advanced beings from the Gate of the Void who have blended into the earth... If my guess is correct, this person whose code name is Judgment comes from the Gate of the Void. door."</p>
