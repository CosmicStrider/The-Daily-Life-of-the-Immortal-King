  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1271 100% Consecration Technique</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Remember in one second</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now, the death of Heavenly Dao has been confirmed. The appearance of these ancient Golden Men is definitely not due to any misunderstanding.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Obviously, this was a premeditated action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Outside the door. I don't know whose order you are under. But you dare to interfere with the master, Heavenly Dao. Have you thought about the consequences?" Death Heavenly Dao's voice was low.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was already very angry. Even the suspenders on his overalls were trembling with the anger radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi Fearing death, Heavenly Dao took out a basketball from his pocket the next second. He quickly protected Sun Rong and stepped back.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Heaven...Tao?" Sun Rong heard a word that was extremely familiar but also felt extremely strange.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Isn't this the existence that all cultivators are eager to pursue?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So the young man standing in front of her to protect him is the incarnation of Heavenly Dao?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl covered her mouth in disbelief.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There are six main messengers in Heavenly Dao. Life and death, spirit, space, time, power and soul. This one is sent by my master." Zhuo Yi explained on the side.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong was even more surprised: "Who is the master of senior Zhuo Yi..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi was silent for a moment: "That's Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Anyway, after the soul returns to the body, all memories will be cleared.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi thinks it doesn’t matter if I say it now.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the contrary, the girl's expression was not as surprised as Zhuo Yi imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So that's it. It seems...I owe my classmate Wang Ling another life."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, the girl's mood was particularly complicated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The confusion, emotion, and surprise after hearing the name were all intertwined together.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Sun Rong knows that now is not the time to sigh.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You don't look that surprised."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I should have thought of that!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong smiled and said: "We were attacked by the Shadow Stream Killer before. But for that memory, I always feel that the relationship between the past and the past is not connected. I once thought that there was something wrong with my memory... But why did Senior Zhuo Yi tell me this?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You will know later." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He thought it was a white lie.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If I tell the girl now, after she returns to the physical body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The memory of this out-of-body experience will all disappear.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I'm afraid. A little cruel.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao stood alone in front, holding only a chain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The power of the main messenger Heavenly Dao exerted a huge advantage at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even if the opponent is the ancient Golden Men. After all, it cannot be the opponent of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His previous questioning was a warning. Heavenly Dao hoped that these ancient Golden Men would be reined in in time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But now it seems that these Golden Men are here under orders from death. Negotiations are not working at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And now. There is not much time left for Heavenly Dao to die.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is the path you chose. Don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There were about forty seconds left. Heavenly Dao decided to die immediately. He put the chain in the "Death Immediate Letter".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In an instant, a shrill and shrill sound, like the screams of a resentful ghost, came from outside the ward door.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, these chains were quickly absorbed by the Book of Death!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Together with the ancient Golden Men who controlled the chains, they were all absorbed into the book!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Became a beautiful illustration...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at it in amazement.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is definitely a masterpiece at the level of p station...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi;"Is everything done?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao snorted: "Just a small ancient Golden Men. How dare you make a mistake in front of me."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the matter obviously didn't end there.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sir, do you think the other party will send someone else?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Definitely. They've noticed us. There was one seductress before. And now there's another one. There will definitely be more in the next wave."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao said: "But fortunately, we have something to do now. As long as we pry open the mouth of this ancient Golden Men before the next wave of seducers arrive, we may be able to know what happened."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After that. Death Heavenly Dao plans to go and see the situation of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, at this time, the {Death Talisman} took effect again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Same as before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl said "Ouch" and was sucked back into her own body again...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side. Zhuo Yi is typing quickly on his own.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao asked: "What are you doing?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I've prepared the questions and answers that Sun Rong's junior classmate will ask when she wakes up soon... I'll save myself a while and explain them later."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Below is the interrogation of an ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao opens the Book of Death and drops out the spirit body of an ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked shocked. These ancient Golden Men were too tall. One of them was as tall as one meter. More than half taller than the Heavenly Dao of Death...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"After all, they are the ancient Golden Men." Zhuo Yi looked at this scene and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He doesn't know now whether he should say that the ancient Golden Men were too well-nourished or that the current Heavenly Dao Golden Men are stunted...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And Death Heavenly Dao heard Zhuo Yi's voice and felt aggrieved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This actually has a lot to do with food...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Like them this time, what they eat the most are the expired snacks exchanged by Wang Ling!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Damn it if you can develop well!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">^0^ Remember in one second</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, after Lord Diu Lei sent a text message to Wang Ling, Wang Ling immediately teleported to the gate of Kaiguang Temple.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao is here to help produce the death talisman. And the quality is acceptable. So there is no need to worry in the short term.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ling had his trouser pockets inserted and looked at the ruined temple in front of him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Everything Lord Diu Lei experienced in the ruined temple. He saw it all with King's Eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This Zen Master Jin Deng is indeed not an ordinary person. Lord Diu Lei cannot handle it alone. So Wang Ling feels it is necessary to test it personally.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course. The most important thing is that Zen Master Jin Deng seems to know the ins and outs of the entire incident.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Inside the temple. Zen Master Jin Deng knocks on wooden fish.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Wang Ling appeared at the door of the temple, he had already noticed Wang Ling's aura.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Your friend is here." Zen Master Jin Deng smiled slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei sits aside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the next moment, Zen Master Jin Deng made a "thud" sound and hit the wooden fish hard.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In an instant, an extremely powerful spiritual energy wave spread from the wooden fish like ripples.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All the objects in the temple, including the door, are coated with a light golden light!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Poor monk, the consecration has been completed. Whether your friend can come in depends on your friend's ability."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Zen Master Jin Deng was tapping the wooden fish calmly, full of confidence.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The consecration spell for which he is famous is unrivaled in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even Dao Ancestor Wang would have to be extremely wary of his [Consecration Technique].</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng smiled heartily.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In this world, since Dao Ancestor Wang entered the infinite reincarnation like him and disappeared.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It has been a long time since he performed this 100% consecration technique.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Lord Diu Lei came in earlier.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He only used 5% of the consecration technique.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng knows it very well.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In this world, I am afraid that only the young man outside the door deserves to enjoy such treatment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I want to see how much effort it takes for your friend to open this door." Master Jin Deng smiled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the next moment, his smile quickly stiffened...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because there was a loud "boom" at the door!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng didn't have time to react.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The two doors had been shattered and turned into sawdust on the ground.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the door. Wang Ling raised his index finger and sighed slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He didn't expect that he only used 1% of his finger strength. The door would break...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You know, he usually does eye exercises at school. When he presses the Jingming and Sibai points, his finger strength is 100%...</p>
