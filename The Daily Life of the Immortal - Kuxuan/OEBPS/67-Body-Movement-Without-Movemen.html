  <h1>Chapter 67 Body Movement Without Movement </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>The system had converted everyone's strength into digital data and divided it into twenty levels. With each level upgrade, each person's strength would be unsealed by five percent.</p>

      <p>But Wang Ling had discovered that this data conversion didn't seem to work on him since he wasn't a Foundation Establishment cultivator to begin with. Up to now, he had been faking his realm at school...</p>

      <p>Foundation Establishment high schools would have Foundation Establishment students, so the system for this trial version of "Cultivator's Rift" would naturally set the range for the data conversion at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

      <p>In other words, Wang Ling wasn't like everyone else whose data had been converted in the genuine sense.</p>

      <p>Although his rank had been divided into twenty parts and he needed to accumulate experience in order to level up, this kind of upgrade was meaningless for him.</p>

      <p>So even if he was currently only at Level 1, right now on this map, his existence was that of a god.</p>

      <p>Forget the three people coming to capture the bot lane, even if it was an entire army division, he felt he could kill all of them with one slash of his sword.</p>

      <p>However, as a qualified support, there was no way he could act on his own; the income and lead of the bot lane should be entrusted to the carry <sup>1</sup> . Looking back at Guo Hao, who was already shaking as he withdrew into the turret, Wang Ling walked step by step out of the reed marsh.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Carry" is a term that is typically used to refer to the primary damage dealer/killer on a team.)</dfn>

      <p>He had decided to sacrifice his body by going out to "seduce" the enemy...</p>

      <p>Passing the opportunity on to other people was the best way he could think of to draw attention away from him.</p>

      <p>Even if he couldn't kill people, he could at least use some cheat moves on them.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze, Liang Zheng and Liang Fei lurked in the reed marsh on the red side.</p>

      <p>In the virtual game space, everyone had been transformed into data and their auras together with their spiritual senses had been sealed off by the system. Hence, there was no fear that their auras would be detected by the enemy.</p>

      <p>"Check it out, that pretty boy is coming out!"</p>

      <p>"This guy is only Level 1, where does his courage come from?"</p>

      <p>"Looking at his broke appearance, he definitely doesn't play games often. My guess is that it's a trap!"</p>

      <p>"Then are we going or not?"</p>

      <p>Several people squatted in the grass as they discussed the issue animatedly before finally fixing their eyes on Tang Jingze's face. "Senior, please say something!"</p>

      <p>To be honest, Tang Jingze's reaction was to reject going at first... after all, after two days' worth of encounters with Wang Ling, he had already reflected deeply on everything and was now profoundly aware of how poisonous this pretty boy with the crew cut was.</p>

      <p><em>Go!</em></p>

      <p><em>Or don't go...</em></p>

      <p><em>That is the question.</em></p>

      <p>In this type of MOBA game, it was quite a common tactic to gank someone <sup>2</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(To gank someone is to ambush them.)</dfn>

      <p>At the moment, they had more people and higher levels. Wang Ling, who was just at Level 1, was like a slab of plump pork in Tang Jingze's eyes, dripping with fresh soy sauce as well as caviar, and the aroma of the meat could be smelled from miles away!</p>

      <p>At last, Tang Jingze gnashed his teeth. "Go!"</p>

      <p><em>We have more people, what the fuck is there to be afraid of?!</em></p>

      <p>On the other side and holed up in the turret, Guo Hao saw from a distance something rustling ahead in the reed marsh. Then he saw three people, each one carrying a blank sword, descend upon Wang Ling. "Classmate Wang Ling, look out!"</p>

      <p>After data conversion, spirit energy was represented by blue bars. Before a spirit sword was formally built, whatever effect sword skills had was next to nothing and just exhausted blue bars in vain. Therefore, after extensive consideration, the three people who had jumped out chose a common attack strategy, planning to rely on numbers to beat Wang Ling to death.</p>

      <p>"Pegasus Meteor Sword!"</p>

      <p>"Embracing Beauty Kill!"</p>

      <p>"Star Burst Stream!"</p>

      <p>Although these sword skills weren't much, an ordinary attack still had a name which had to be shouted out loudly so that it looked mighty enough. After all, it was an eternal truth that the output all depended on the strength of their roars.</p>

      <p>Three people carrying blank swords struck hard at Wang Ling, as mighty and majestic as a man lassoing horses.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling stood there calmly and didn't do anything. He knew exactly what would happen if the three individuals managed to cut him. Although they were currently only in a game, there would still be a physical backlash from his immortal flesh. If these three people cut him with their swords... wouldn't they be destroyed by the backlash, without leaving behind even slag?</p>

      <p>This was completely not what he wanted to see happen.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, to win three kills was really too eye-catching.</p>

      <p>Then, now was the time to test his body movement.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was self-taught when it came to a lot of his skills, but growing up, he had rarely had the opportunity to fully use the truly lethal skills. Body movement was the only skill that he could practise at leisure.</p>

      <p>In the cultivation world, most body movement skills emphasized a solid foundation and advanced planning so that one could gauge an incoming attack and then avoid it.</p>

      <p>But Wang Ling wasn't able to do this because such body movements were too advanced and eye-catching. Hence, after practising for a long period of time, he had cobbled together a body movement skill that was the most suitable for him.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, the conclusion that he had come to was â€” the best evasion strategy was no strategy, the most heaven-defying body movement was no movement...</p>

      <p>"It looks like this ambush will succeed, first blood will be spilled on the bot lane," Headmaster Jin said with a grave face.</p>

      <p>The female host exclaimed, "Now Students Tang Jingze, Liang Zheng and Liang Fei from Number 59 High School have taken the initiative to strike at poor, helpless Student Wang Ling! What will the results be?!"</p>

      <p>Everyone held their breaths as they watched Tang Jingze and the other two strike suddenly and swiftly with their blank swords.</p>

      <p>The wind pressure ruffled Wang Ling's short hair...</p>

      <p>Ordinarily, they should have hit their mark!</p>

      <p>However, it became a scene that no one could have imagined.</p>

      <p>Facing an attack from three sides, Wang Ling, who had originally been standing still in one place, made a sudden and slight move.</p>

      <p>The average distance between these three swords and his body was just 0.01 centimeters. However! He sidestepped them, so though the tips of their swords were so close to his skin, they unexpectedly only cut air...</p>

      <p>"Bloody hell?! ...This, what type of body movement is this?" The female host, Headmaster Jin and his followers were all stunned.</p>

      <p>"We haven't started teaching body movement classes at our Number 60 High School. For Student Wang Ling to be able to dodge... maybe he just has good luck."</p>

      <p>"This boy must have taught himself! Dodging three swords with a sidestep, how is that possible!"</p>

      <p>"Headmaster Jin, don't get excited. The old Secretary is also sitting here, how about we ask him for his opinion?"</p>

      <p>On the stage, all the leaders watched a replay of the scene.</p>

      <p>The old Secretary stared at the replay, then shook his head slightly. "I also can't tell what body movement this student is using, it just looks purely like an ordinary sidestep for dodging."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Since even this old Secretary had said so, Headmaster Jin was immediately speechless. The old Secretary's prowess was unfathomable, so the authority in his remark was naturally beyond doubt.</p>

      <p>The female host glanced at the income disparity on the map and couldn't help sighing. "The students from Number 59 High School failed to capture the bot lane this time and also lost out on the income in the lane, so the students from Number 60 High School are leading with two thousand gold coins! Hopefully the students from Number 59 High School won't be discouraged and will continue fighting!"</p>

      <p>Hearing the female host's words, Headmaster Chen smiled complacently. "That's why for this kind of team game, my advice is to not make such a big deal of it in the early stages; steady development is the key."</p>

      <p>"Chen Tianxiang, don't be so pleased with yourself. I'll definitely pull ahead later!" Headmaster Jin puffed up his cheeks and glared at Headmaster Chen as he spoke to him telepathically.</p>

      <p>On the stage, the leaders were engaged in heated discussion. Only Zhuo Yi alone stared in deep silence at the image... because he was the only one who knew how unfathomable this youth really was.</p>

      <p>Six years ago, this type of terrifying strength that had killed the demon king with one blow... even the old Secretary might not necessarily have been able to do it.</p>

      <p>What surprised him was that he had been searching high and low for Wang Ling for so long, but the other party had seemed to be aware of it and had used various ways to avoid him. And when they finally, truly met again after six years, it turned out to be at this spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

      <p>Looking at Wang Ling's young face which had matured a little and at the same time recalling that small, boyish face from six years ago...</p>

      <p>At this moment, Zhuo Yi felt like a whole lifetime had passed him by.</p>
