  <h1>Chapter 81 Online Shopping for Cultivators </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was at least hundreds of millions of kilometers from the urban-rural fringe area where Wang Ling lived to the border of Huaxiu nation; he rarely used the Great Teleportation Spell over such a long distance.</p>

    <p>However, looking at the result... at least his favorite crispy noodle snacks were saved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling returned to his desk and stared contemplatively at the sun outside his bedroom skylight. He had deliberately avoided Uncle Black's line of sight the whole time; as long as Uncle Black didn't see his face directly, he could ensure that the "Great Shielding Spell" would continue to work. Luckily, that wuss hadn't dared to look at him at all, the pressure of Wang Ling's power almost frightening him into pissing his pants.</p>

    <p>He could now guarantee that this Magic Uncle Black wouldn't dare stir up trouble with him any longer. On the other hand, Zhuo Yi continued to be a big problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling let out a sigh. He really had to find a solution to this, otherwise it would become very troublesome sooner or later.</p>

    <p>But after recent events, he had also gained some inspiration.</p>

    <p>It was time he prepared himself a mask.</p>

    <p>The Great Shielding Spell was only effective if the people whose ambitions centered around Wang Ling had never seen his real face. Otherwise, even changing his appearance with the Great Transfiguration Spell would be no use. Wearing a mask thus would be relatively good protection.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that he hadn't considered it before, it was just that he had been reluctant to buy one. This was because his pocket money was very limited; Father Wang was like an autocratic shopkeeper who only gave him a pitiful amount every month. He would also think of all sorts of ways to deduct money.</p>

    <p>Deduct one hundred for breaking a spoon...</p>

    <p>Deduct fifty for snapping a chopstick...</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's elite class, there were fifteen students. As long as his exam grades put him at rank eight or above, five hundred would be directly deducted!</p>

    <p>Given the bowls, chopsticks and spoons that he accidentally broke every month, and the furniture he banged up when he wasn't careful... there wasn't time for his pocket money to grow warm in his hand before Father Wang used all kinds of reasons to take it away. Wang Ling even had to think of ways to save money to buy his crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>However, the new Dao talisman seal was at its strongest in the first three months after it was put on. In the short term, Father Wang wouldn't be able to find an excuse to dock Wang Ling's pocket money.</p>

    <p>Hence, these three months would be when he had the most pocket money.</p>

    <p>For things like masks, he felt that it would be fine to just simply buy one to wear as long as it could cover his face.</p>

    <p>But there was a huge range of masks and a variety of styles available online... this was tough for Wang Ling as someone who found it difficult to make choices.</p>

    <p>While he might have thought that he could simply buy any mask, he didn't dare use a poorly made one, otherwise it would split with just one puff of his breath.</p>

    <p>After struggling for a long while with the window tabs that he had opened for other online buyers, Wang Ling finally started searching for a mask.</p>

    <p>He chose two options, "bargain" and "best selling." Instantly, the number of available products in the online cultivation mall were sharply reduced.</p>

    <p>Next, he had to use his 24K gold titanium laser eyes <sup>1</sup> to pick out a mask from the wide variety on hand.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is probably adapted from the Chinese colloquial phrase 亮瞎我的鈦合金狗眼,"so bright it blinds my titanium dog eyes," referring to something that is extremely amazing or mind-boggling.)</dfn>

    <p>Images of all the masks sold in the online cultivation mall were available for perusal, so Wang Ling could use his Heavenly Eye to inspect the materials which the masks were made of.</p>

    <p>— <em>Ding dong!</em></p>

    <p>Just as he was sweeping his eyes over the mall's masks one by one, a private chat window suddenly popped up.</p>

    <p>He opened the window; the name at the top of the window was: "New Century Cultivation Mask Shop."</p>

    <p>It was very clear that this shop had installed some kind of software to automatically send a private message to customers browsing its products. Like some private hospitals that got into price wars online — as soon as you visited their websites, they would open private chat windows to boast about their medical skills and how brilliant they were. In the end, you spent money but still couldn't save your life.</p>

    <p>This kind of behavior really disgusted Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to close the window, a shop customer service employee quickly sent a smiling emoji with a rose in its mouth and a message. "This cultivation friend, please stay!"</p>

    <p>It was practically instinctive for Wang Ling to type out an ellipsis. <em>" </em>..."</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling's reply, the customer service employee seemed very enthusiastic and immediately replied, "It appears this cultivation friend is looking for a mask. I can assure you that the prices of the masks in our shop are the lowest online, and we guarantee their quality. What type of mask is this cultivation friend looking for? We have everything here! (This message has been typed out manually and is not an automatic reply, please don't doubt our sincerity!)"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling was a bit speechless, and before he could reply, the customer service employee sent another message. "Cultivation friend, I understand you might still be confused. Then let me quickly introduce some of our latest and most popular masks to you!"</p>

    <p>Very quickly, the customer service employee sent him the first picture, which was of a green mask that was a little strange. It had clear facial features and couldn't be considered ugly, but it also seemed to be glowing fluorescent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked, "What is this?"</p>

    <p>"Cultivation friend, are you mortified by your lover having affairs all over the place? Are you looking for first love? Are you looking for a way to regain your spouse's love? Our latest Green Light of Forgiveness mask can fundamentally help to restore self-confidence and regain your love!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Ah... if this is not to your liking, we have another one."</p>

    <p>Saying this, the customer service employee sent another picture.</p>

    <p>This mask was silver in color and very ordinary in all respects, except that the chin of the mask was unusually sharp.</p>

    <p>"Cultivation friend, are you still afraid of walking on the roads alone at night? Do you often work overtime until dawn? This Liu Baby brand Snake Spirit <sup>2</sup>male mask uses the latest integration technology, mixing hyaluronic acid with metal; this mask not only moisturizes and nourishes your face, the chin of the mask has a black diamond inset, and in a time of crisis can serve as a weapon!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to Liu Zichen, an infamous Chinese online personality who got plastic surgery that gave him a sharper chin and larger eyes like a doll. Netizens have given him the nickname 'Snake Spirit Boy,' based on a Chinese folktale.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a very long time, Wang Ling didn't reply.</p>

    <p>The customer service employee sent Wang Ling a question mark emoji. "Cultivation friend?"</p>

    <p>"...Is there a mask just for covering the face, made from reliable enough materials?"</p>

    <p>This time, it was the customer service employee's turn to send an ellipsis. "..."</p>

    <p>Nowadays, most masks were developed through a combination of cultivation spells and science and were mostly functional types. It was actually very rare to find shops in the whole of the online cultivation mall that sold masks as just face covers. Of course, it wasn't that there weren't any. However, these masks that didn't serve any function were mostly ornamental, and so were often sold at very expensive prices... but Wang Ling wanted something good for cheap...</p>

    <p>This obviously was a real headache for the customer service employee. After about ten minutes, the employee finally sent another picture. The image was of a slightly crude ghost mask with eyes that looked like they had been embellished with something like resin. While it looked a little old-fashioned, overall the mask seemed pretty decent.</p>

    <p>"Cultivation friend, a cheap mask just to cover the face... honestly speaking, it's hard to find such a thing, especially in the online cultivation mall. Our shop does not have many in stock that fit your requirements, but we did find this well-made, cheap... and not too ugly mask."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the picture which the customer service employee had sent him, and felt that this mask basically had everything he needed.</p>

    <p>The most crucial thing was that he had used his Heavenly Eye to look at the material which the stone ghost mask was made from...</p>

    <p>Although he couldn't know with absolute certainty without actually touching the real thing, Wang Ling was nonetheless sure that he had seen primordial black crystal in this stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>Discovered by the General Bureau of World Cultivation, this was the hardest material known to man!</p>
