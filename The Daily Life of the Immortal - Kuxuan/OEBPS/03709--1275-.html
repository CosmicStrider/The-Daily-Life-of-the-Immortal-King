  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1275 Experienced Monk</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just throw it away in one pot?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is indeed a very simple and crude answer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But regarding this matter, Jin Deng actually has something to say.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The unspeakable place. The poor monk actually tried to visit it many times. But he was never able to enter it." Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had the experience of visiting unspeakable places many times. However, he got lost all along the way. He never even stepped through the door.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How about using the technique of sending back?" Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knows. Death Heavenly Dao has captured the ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If he uses the {Return Technique} to teleport back with the ancient Golden Men, he feels that it is not difficult to enter the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhenren's thinking was too simple. The poor monk had also used this technique of sending back, but the situation was much more complicated than the poor monk imagined." The monk said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Unspeakable Land evolved from Chaos. It is difficult for an ordinary cultivator's body to walk in such a space for a long time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even the immortals from Zhenyuan, who have rich galactic roaming abilities, can't avoid it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Only cultivators in the divine realm can stay there for a while. The time cannot exceed 3 minutes at most."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Three minutes..." Lord Diu Lei fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This time is about the same as Ultraman's transformation time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's too short.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Same as Ku Xuan.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is no way. If you get lost in the chaos, you will never come back." Jin Deng shook his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In short. The structure of the Unspeakable Land is like an egg.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The egg shell is like a barrier. The egg white is the circle of chaos. The egg yolk is the unspeakable place.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even if a normal cultivator accidentally enters it, it will only enter the scope of "egg white".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You can only stay for three minutes at most.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is almost impossible to touch the yolk layer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk recalled the scene when he found the unspeakable place. He couldn't break into the core layer of egg yolk.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How long can the master stay in the egg white layer?" Lord Diu Lei asked curiously.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It won't take long. It will only take a little longer than a normal cultivator." The monk said modestly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How long? Three hours?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Thirty days."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Ling Zhenren, I'm afraid it will last longer," the monk said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He thinks Wang Ling can stay there for at least 300 years...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jin Deng: "But even the poor monk. The poor monk has not been able to touch the core layer so far."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is it because of the ban?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The only situation he could think of was this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Not bad." Jin Deng nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Unless Dao Ancestor Wang established a ban that year.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Otherwise {the technique of sending back} would not be effective.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the founder of Heavenly Dao, it is too easy to set up such a ban.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As long as the authority of {Great Teleportation} is turned off within the scope of the Unspeakable Land. No one can directly reach there through Heavenly Dao spells.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, Wang Ling's wish to use Lord Ma to teleport directly to an unspeakable place came to nothing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he always felt that there were other ways.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, I possess more than just the power of Heavenly Dao created by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao, Fate, Shadow...there is always one that suits him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"According to what the poor monk sees, if you want to enter the unspeakable place and completely destroy this place, breaking the restrictions is the key." The monk frowned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He opened his hand and gathered the memory fragments of his intrusion into the unspeakable place into a spiritual energy ball and concentrated it on his palm.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling and Diu Lei reached out and touched each other.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That memory burst into their minds like a three-dimensional movie.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In his memory, the monk is in a chaotic world where light and darkness intertwine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The spatial structure here is extremely complex. Everything is falling apart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk in those days accidentally entered here. His cassocks were all broken. When he entered the space, he was completely naked...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling and Diu Lei looked a bit irritated. They quickly retracted their hands.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm sorry, I'll take care of it for a moment..." Jin Deng blushed as he realized his gaffe.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He almost forgot that he mistakenly entered the circle of chaos in an unspeakable place.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The scene where the cassock was torn to pieces by the invasion of the power of chaos...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After reprocessing the memory ball. Wang Ling and Lord Diu Lei touched the memory ball again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling saw the monk in front of him. His whole body was covered with a thick layer of mosaic... Suddenly the whole scene became even stranger...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Afterwards, the monk kept wandering and walking in the circle of chaos.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It took him several days to finally touch the core.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The unspeakable place. Is that where it is?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the memory screen, Jin Deng looked ahead at a place that looked like a floating island in the universe, wrapped in a faint golden film of light.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There exudes the powerful power of Heavenly Dao. It is fascinating.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At that time, the monk already knew what he had broken into.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is the Heavenly Dao testing ground left behind by Dao Ancestor!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are countless sealed but powerful evil Heavenly Dao imprisoned inside!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Driven by curiosity, the monk instinctively wanted to take a look.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With his ability to shrink the ground to an inch and move thousands of miles in one step, it would not be difficult to break into the unspeakable land.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, that unspeakable place was clearly right in front of him, but he still couldn't get even half closer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk blushed. It seemed that he had tried his best, but he still could not move forward an inch.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The indescribable place so close at hand. It was so far away that he could hardly imagine...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the monk put away his memory ball and said with emotion: "The scene at that time, as Ling Zhenren and Zhenjun saw it, is still unforgettable to this poor monk. The unspeakable place is so clear to the poor monk. Close. But the poor monk is like a monkey trapped in Wuzhi Mountain. He has never been able to take that step and reach the hinterland..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I looked at the memory of the master. The master used a variety of moving methods. But in the end it seemed that no matter how he moved, he still stayed in the same place."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei said: "This unspeakable place. Could it be just an illusion? Like a mirage. It looks very close, but in fact it is still far away..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The poor monk understands what Zhenjun means. The poor monk had a similar idea at the beginning." Jin Deng said: "So, after I determined the location of the unspeakable place, I made full preparations again soon after. I plan to try again...it took me 20 days. The situation is still the same as before."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The concept of twenty days. The monk really cannot describe that feeling in words.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He used the method of shrinking the ground to an inch and traveled frantically for 20 days.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Calculated according to the normal journey, 20 days shrink into an inch. This extraterrestrial galactic road has been traveled back and forth twenty times.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Previously, the Zhenyuan Immortals traveled throughout the entire extraterrestrial galaxy. But it took a full thousand years.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Such a contrast is very obvious.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So. What exactly are the restrictions in the Unspeakable Land?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The poor monk thought that this should be some kind of restriction set by Dao Ancestor..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jin Deng said: "I wonder if Ling Zhenren and Zhenjun have ever played a keyword warning game?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Before the two people have a conversation, they first preset the forbidden words that cannot be mentioned. Then they have a conversation. Whoever mentions the forbidden words in the conversation loses."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"According to poor taoist's speculation for many years, the ban set up by Dao Ancestor should have the same effect as this game."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is it because the monks can't enter?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's not like the poor monk has never thought of this. So in the 3241st life, the poor monk deliberately left his flowing hair...but he still couldn't enter..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Men can't enter?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This. The poor monk tried it in his 3903rd life. In this life, the poor monk deliberately reincarnated himself into a woman. It was also the only life in which the poor monk changed his gender. Moreover, the poor monk was not used to it at the beginning. Always standing and peeing."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
