  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1230: Vain "confidence"</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Several parties were fighting for it. It ended with the unilateral crushing of Zhenyuan Immortals. Zhuo Yi used his spiritual sword to break the door of the prison car. Seeing that Keorn had passed out, he didn't think much about it. . He directly picked up Keorn and sprinted for 100 meters. He opened the back cabin of Wuling Hongguang and threw the person in. Then he drove away as if he was flying.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The progress is smoother than Zhuo Yi imagined. His next plan is to drive to the Office of Strategic Deception. The gate of the Office of Strategic Deception is outside Songhai City. Currently, the Office of Strategic Deception is relatively safe. It's a place where even if someone wants to come and ask for someone, it's not that easy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi has decided to pry Keorn's mouth open before anyone tracks his location!</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi walked there for about five or six minutes. The gravity suppression arranged by Zhenyuan Immortal people in front of the toll station unlocked the power of Venerated Immortal. That is, you can do whatever you want...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The three groups of people got up from the ground one after another. Their faces were covered with gravel. Some of them had blood marks from the pressure. They were all gray and gray. They were dizzy and felt a little dizzy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Long-term gravity suppression will block blood circulation. Therefore, the first thing a group of people feel after getting up is numbness in their legs...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">More than forty people got up from the ground. Everyone was wearing night clothes. They were so dazzled that they couldn't tell the difference between friend and foe. They immediately formed a circle around the prison transport vehicle...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who the hell are you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who are you..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The three groups of people asked each other. They all took out their magic weapons and threatened each other.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although they all spoke Mandarin, they obviously had accents from different places, making the scene even more confusing.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Everyone, the person we wanted to rob was snatched away by another group of people. Now if we start fighting among ourselves again, wouldn't it make the fourth group of people laugh at us?" At this time, the representative of one group of people suddenly said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's right! Brothers. I also think it's not wise for us to stand here right now...and the police are coming soon! The three of us might as well catch up. Each one depends on his ability!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Okay! Shall we withdraw then?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How to withdraw?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wherever it came from, go back there!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The more than 40 people gathered together and hit it off immediately. They scattered towards the direction where they had previously ambush.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The person who wanted to be robbed was kidnapped by others. Without knowing the origin of the other party, these people said they wanted to catch up. But in fact, they still had to ask for instructions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After the operation failed, the group of relatively burly men in black who fell from the sky were quickly picked up by an armed helicopter. A group of people discussed the follow-up plan on the helicopter.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The leader took off his mask and revealed his face. Like Keorn, he was a Western cultivator. He had dark blue eyes, a tall nose, and long sideburns. He was using the communication ball for assimilation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Them. From SBP Foundation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The team leader conversed with the judge in fluent Mandarin. They are all capable officers of the SBP Foundation lurking in the Huaxiu region.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Lord Judgment. I'm sorry. The operation failed. There were three people we robbed...Snake deserves death."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I already know about this. I don't blame you for this." The black shadow on the other side of the communication ball said: "And I already know. Those three groups of people. One is from the Huaguo Shui Lian Group. The other is from the Huaxiu AllianceGeneral Alliance. And finally All the way. Probably from the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The Office of Strategic Deception actually has such a powerful master?" Snake was shocked in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't panic. I will send someone to support you immediately. You just need to follow the instructions I will give you later. Go to the designated coordinates and wait."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes." Snake nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, the call between the two was interrupted.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the edge of the cliff in the lonely forest of Mixiu Country. In front of an old castle baptized by the moonlight. The owner of the old castle in a black cloak accepted the baptism of night. He stood on the edge of the cliff. He slowly stretched out his hands to embrace the moon. . A devout prayer to the great void in the name of judgment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Great Lord of the Void! Thank you for the Lord's salvation! Please ask the Lord to save the people of the Void. Restart the Void! We, the people of the Void lurking here, will definitely offer the most sincere gift of life to the Lord!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After the prayer, the owner of the cloak returned to the castle. The old woman standing silently by the door took off the cloak of the owner of the castle and hung it on a hanger. The owner of the castle finally revealed his pale face without a trace of blood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In front of the gorgeous long dining table, two tall candlesticks emitted firelight. The old woman pushed the dining cart: "Master Bai, the tonic is ready. Please use it slowly."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The young man coughed. He scooped up a spoonful of red medicinal soup. He came closer and savored the aroma of the medicinal soup... That beautiful feeling seemed to make him forget all his worries in a short period of time. Forget. His past. He even forgot for a moment the boy who he hated so much.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Countless nights. Those dead fish eyes seemed to torture him like a nightmare...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Before drinking the soup, the young man glanced at the old woman with his peripheral vision: "My name is Xu Bai. I am a citizen of the void... The Bai Zhe who used to be has nothing to do with me anymore."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes... please remember..." The old woman realized that she had just made a mistake. After bowing and bowing, she hurriedly left while pushing the dining cart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As the young man said, the great void gave him a third life. His second life was given by a white-haired boy whose face he couldn't see clearly...but it was a pity that the boy did not reuse him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was once a lord. But after he was resurrected, Bai Zhe found that he was not even as good as a dog.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In extreme grief and anger, Bai Zhe chose to end his life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His third life was given by the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The void gave him everything he wanted. It even helped him advance to become a higher-level life form "Void Spirit". After a period of time, he began to search for his host invisibly... and then... this Mr. "Judgement" of the SBP Foundation became his perfect host.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As his ethereal body began to merge with "Judgement", he took away everything from "Judgement".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Memory, realm, wealth, reputation...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These things that he had lost were now regained by him with the help of Void!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, he changed his name to Xubai!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is a devout citizen of the void!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">They are even higher beings that are superior to human cultivators!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With the nourishment of the medicinal decoction, he will be able to fully adapt to the body of "Judgement" within a few days.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he is now confident that he can kill Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he didn't want to act in such a hurry.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Letting someone die is not the greatest torture.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The greatest torture is to make a person lose everything he wants.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And Xu Bai thought very clearly. What he wanted to take away was the peaceful life that Wang Ling longed for most.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wang Ling. What should you do?" The young man put ladle after ladle of red medicinal soup into his mouth, showing a sneer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had finished praying into the night.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The great Lord of the Void will reopen the Gate of the Void. Once again, he will test the world...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">PS:</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Vote: Please guess. How many slaps can Xubai get from Wang Ling?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A:1-3 times</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">B:3-5 times</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">C:6-10 times</p>
