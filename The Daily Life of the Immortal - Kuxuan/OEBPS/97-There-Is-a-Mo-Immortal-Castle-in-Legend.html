  <h1>Chapter 97 There Is a Mo Immortal Castle in Legend </h1>

  <div>

    <p>A cursed mask?</p>

    <p>Could it be the stone ghost mask?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it was inconceivable. If there really was some old man hiding inside the stone ghost mask, there was no way his spiritual senses would have missed such a critical detail... he was now more firmly convinced of his previous assumption.</p>

    <p>That is, this stone ghost mask was a twin magic treasure.</p>

    <p>If what Teacher Wang said was true, this Devil Emperor Gua Pi had hidden inside the twin stone ghost mask in the other world, but could certainly remotely control the stone ghost mask in Wang Ling's possession.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he had gotten caught up in something troublesome; furthermore, it was quite the thorny problem.</p>

    <p>While he was still pondering this, Teacher Wang had finished with his gossip on Devil Emperor Gua Pi and had started to run through related knowledge points on "The Second Gua Pi War."</p>

    <p>"After the First Gua Pi War which we talked about earlier, the former commander of the Gua Pi Army, Devil Emperor Gua Pi, retreated to parts unknown. It was his disciple, Immortal She Pi, who took charge of the Gua Pi Army and continued to wreak havoc on the national economy. Furthermore, Immortal She Pi attempted to take advantage of a population addicted to melon rind in order to tear down the might of Huaxiu nation and then seize power over the country. Of course, in order to stabilize the situation during this period, the nation negotiated many times with this second generation leader of the Gua Pi Army, Immortal She Pi, and signed a number of unequal treaties. Since you will one hundred percent be tested on the contents of these treaties, I'll highlight the main points for you in brief..."</p>

    <p>The contents of these treaties were pretty much the same, and didn't contain anything out of the ordinary. At this point, Teacher Wang brought up something interesting again. "Does anyone know the outcome of the Second Gua Pi War?"</p>

    <p>Top students in the class would definitely have looked over the lesson in advance. After Teacher Wang asked this question, everyone saw Sun Rong immediately raise her hand, then stand up, her pretty figure capturing the attention of all the boys and girls in class.</p>

    <p>"In the Second Gua Pi War, three founding generals of Huaxiu nation, General Yi, General Shi and General Sun, joined forces to suppress and capture Immortal She Pi alive. General Lin burning all the melons in the Humen region was a turning point which brought an end to the Gua Pi Army's regime as well as its pyramid scheme and its heavy toll on the national economy. It was also a demonstration of the national cultivation spirit shown by Huaxiu nation's cultivators in their vigorous defense of the country!"</p>

    <p>"Well said!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Wang nodded with satisfaction, then narrowed his eyes. "But, does anyone know what happened to this Immortal She Pi in the end?"</p>

    <p>No one in class said anything; it appeared that Immortal She Pi's end wasn't a main test point, and had never appeared in the theory of history textbook.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully recalled the historical cultivation tales that he had read before, only to realize that he had very little memory of anything to do with Immortal She Pi; even then, most of it were trivial details. This only proved one thing â€” after the end of the Second Gua Pi War, Huaxiu nation as the victor had concealed a small, unrevealed part of history, and the tale of Immortal She Pi was clearly part of this...</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes were on the dais, where Teacher Wang smiled with a trace of cunning... once again, they were stunned.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Teacher Wang truly was Teacher Wang...</p>

    <p>Although they didn't know how he had learned this inside story in history, when it came to the wealth of historical knowledge he possessed, there was no one in class who would dare question it.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling found himself more and more curious about Teacher Wang's identity.</p>

    <p>Really, what kind of man was this?</p>

    <p>To know so much and still be alive... Wang Ling felt that it really was a fucking miracle!</p>

    <p>"Back then, after the Second Gua Pi War, Immortal She Pi had been sentenced to ten years of being struck by thunder and lightning for crimes against the national economy, treason, civil unrest and drug-trafficking. After that, Immortal She Pi was to be executed under Leifeng Pagoda."</p>

    <p>When Teacher Wang spoke up to this point, a lot of people in the class swallowed nervously and shivered in fear.</p>

    <p>"But as far as I know, right before Immortal She Pi's execution, the executioner discovered that the prisoner was pregnant... after that, following a discussion meeting held by Chief Hou of the National Execution Office, it was decided that Immortal She Pi would be allowed to give birth. After all, the child was innocent."</p>

    <p>Someone couldn't help asking for the conclusion to the whole story. "What happened after that?"</p>

    <p>"After that, Immortal She Pi gave up the hiding places of the last of the high-ranked Gua Pi Army officers who were still at large in exchange for a chance at redemption. Rumors are that Immortal She Pi could have avoided execution and be sentenced to life imprisonment instead, but in the end, Immortal She Pi refused this arrangement."</p>

    <p>"Why was that?"</p>

    <p>"Of course, it was because Immortal She Pi wanted to fight for the rights of the child. If the people knew that Immortal She Pi had a child, it would definitely be forced to endure cold eyes and censure. Therefore, before being executed under Leifeng Pagoda, Immortal She Pi kowtowed three times to Chief Hou of the National Execution Office and pleaded that he help hide the child's true identity."</p>

    <p>"..." Hearing this, everyone already had nothing else to say. <em>Since Immortal She Pi had already asked the nation to hide this secret, how the fuck did you know about it?!</em></p>

    <p>"Actually, this period in history isn't some sort of secret. The story of Immortal She Pi's three kowtows under Leifeng Pagoda can be found in university history textbooks, though most of them cover it very briefly. This isn't a compulsory test point, but as my students, I hope for everyone to have a little understanding of history."</p>

    <p>A grin split Teacher Wang's chubby face. "I wonder, after listening to this story, what has everyone learned from it?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao raised his hand diffidently. "Teacher wants to say... that a mother's love is great?"</p>

    <p>"Not really."</p>

    <p>Teacher Wang shook his head. "What I want to tell you is that Immortal She Pi was actually a man. But his physiology was different from a normal person's, and he was a hermaphrodite."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before long, the theory of history class was over and Teacher Wang's face glowed as he left to the sound of the students' cheers.</p>

    <p>And then, the whole class energetically started discussing the details of the theory of history lesson which they had just had.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was red-faced with excitement at what he had just heard. "When should we organize a trip to Leifeng Pagoda?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." <em>Are we going to visit Bai Suzhen <sup>1</sup> </em><em>?</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Leifeng Pagoda features famously in the classic Chinese folktale 'The Legend of the White Snake.' Bai Suzhen is the name of the white snake spirit who was able to take human form, and at one point was imprisoned in Leifeng Pagoda.)</dfn>

    <p>"If Immortal She Pi's child is still alive, calculating the age, he or she should be our grandfathers' age?" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"I don't care about that! What I really want to know is whether Immortal She Pi's kid is also a hermaphrodite!" Lin Xiaoyu had an excited expression on her face. This veteran fujoshi's brain was full of words like hermaphrodite, self-<em>gong </em>and self- <em>shou </em>, which frightened Wang Ling a little.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao shrugged, and gave his own opinion. "Hermaphrodite or not, most people nowadays call for gender equality. Do you know how many types of human genders there are?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao laughed "hehe" as he stretched out a palm and started counting carefully.</p>

    <p>"There are five types of human genders in all: man, man-oriented, bisexual, woman-oriented, and woman."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Tch, don't give me such weird looks! This is knowledge I picked up through my hard work in my extra-curricular studies." Guo Hao waved his hand. "Do you know Mo Immortal Castle?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled for a moment. If he wasn't mistaken, this was the name of a tuition center which had been enjoying widespread popularity in the last two years.</p>

    <p>"This is where I go for extra lessons. If you can learn and sing the theme song a day after entering the school, your school fees will be cut in half!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, Guo Hao cleared his throat and started to sing...</p>

    <p>"There is a Mo Immortal Castle in legend, with an extraordinary Lord of the Castle. Any Mo Immortal who receives his guidance can look forward to a better world..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this song, Wang Ling and the comrades around him fell into complete pandemonium.</p>
