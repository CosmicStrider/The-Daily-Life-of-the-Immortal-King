  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1220 Mr. Wang Zukang negotiates with Principal Chen</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">General Yi has retired on the surface, but in fact he still controls certain rights. When Principal Chen was at Qixing, General Yi was still his swordsmanship teacher. On the one hand, he was a teacher who was kind to him. On the other hand, he was the teacher of Number 60 High School today. Dad, the biggest financial backer. How to weigh the two put Principal Chen in a dilemma.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Helpless. Principal Chen had no choice but to call Mr. Wang Zukang here. Among all the teachers in the school, Mr. Wang Zukang is prudent and worthy of a big responsibility. He is also one of the people Principal Chen has always trusted most. If he is a hundred years later, Retire from this position. Principal Chen even had plans to let Mr. Wang Zukang take over as the next generation principal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Old Wang. What do you think we should do about this matter..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sun Yiyuan is a businessman. He may not agree to this matter, but he may put forward some conditions." Mr. Wang Zukang lowered his head and thought. As for what kind of conditions it is, it is difficult for Mr. Wang Zukang to guess. The Huaguo Shui Lian Group is as rich as any country. And Mr. Sun, the high-ranking Boss, has gotten almost everything he wants in his life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What such a man needs is really hard to predict.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What you said makes sense." Principal Chen strongly agreed with Mr. Wang Zukang's point of view.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There are no people who cannot be friends without their quirks. Even Mr. Sun must have something he wants but can't get."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang said deeply: "Not everything can be bought with money."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Principal Chen pondered for a moment. He stood up from his seat. He straightened his clothes and said, "As for this matter, I'd like you to come with me."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have classes this afternoon."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Find someone to take your place. Or just say that you are sick. The teachers in our school's physical education department get sick every day. How normal."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"When will we leave?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"now!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Songhai City. The weather suddenly darkened in the afternoon. Dark clouds rolled over the city in the sky. The glory and brightness of the whole world seemed to be obscured. During the storm, Principal Chen and Mr. Wang Zukang rode in the Principal's car of Number 60 High School. To Huaguo Shui Lian Group Building.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's rare to see such weather. It looks like the end of the world." Principal Chen turned his gaze to the window. The rain was so heavy that the car's wipers didn't work at all. The driver could only turn on the psychic barrier to block the rain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The psychic barrier is suitable for such extreme weather. It can also prevent car accidents. But the disadvantage is that it consumes a lot of fuel when turned on. In order to save gas money, Principal Chen usually does not get out of the way when going out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Remember to turn it off when the rain subsides later," Principal Chen said to the driver.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"eh..." the driver nodded helplessly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You are too fussy." Mr. Wang Zukang laughed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There's no way. You'll know when you sit in this position. We only have so much money in total. We still have to save some. We can't be extravagant and wasteful."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Huaguo Shui Lian Group Building. Boss Mr. Sun is appreciating some calligraphy paintings on his desk. The joy of the poor is money. The joy of the rich lies in literature and art. These calligraphy paintings are all written by Situ, a famous calligrapher in modern times. . The full name is "Ten Perfect Landscape Pictures". There are ten pictures in total!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Boss Sun spent a huge price to buy three of the ten pictures from other calligraphy collectors. Jiang Xiaoche stood aside and couldn't help sighing. He felt that Wang Ling likes to eat crispy noodles. Ji Ka. This personality is somewhat similar to that of my old man.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After looking at the time, Jiang Xiaoche decided to remind him: "Master, it is said that he is already on his way."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I knew that Chen Tianxiang would be unable to hold back and come to look for me." Sun Yiyuan smiled lightly, showing an expression as if he had everything under control. In Songhai City, the Huaguo Shui Lian Group has a lot of eyeliners, and there is no sign of any trouble. Under control. The old man sitting with pancakes and fruit in front of Number 60 High School is actually from the Huaguo Shui Lian Group.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Are you really going to help Yi Zhiyang?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That little guy is really pitiful. He was beaten into autism by Rongrong in a few rounds. Rongrong's attack was indeed a bit harsh. After this incident, didn't I immediately ask you to send someone to deliver the medicine? In order not to We have been responsible for the physical injuries. The psychological problems are also on our shoulders. I'm afraid this is a bit unjustifiable."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Yiyuan said this. Jiang Xiaoche nodded like a chicken pecking at rice: "That's what the master said."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some children today are indeed psychologically fragile. Perhaps it is due to the inferiority complex caused by differences in family environment. Or perhaps it is because their parents are spoiled and pampered. If they are a little wronged, they will die.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Obviously, Yi Zhiyang's situation today has something to do with General Yi's education.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This Yi Zhiyang has been called the invincible player in the world since he was a child. He also received the true inheritance of General Yi. He has never lost a game since he was a child..." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's not a good thing to be too smooth. When Rongrong was growing up, I also deliberately arranged for many Golden Core masters to pretend to be in the Foundation Building stage and fight her. She lost several times."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Master is wise..." Jiang Xiaoche knew this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These men are sent to fight with the lady. At the same time, they must ensure that the lady cannot be hurt during the fight. The pay for one hit is extremely high, comparable to his salary for a year!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, Jiang Xiaoche still didn't understand something about Yi Zhiyang: "Master, I have a question."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You said."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Since you can disguise yourself, why not let others use the transformation technique to pretend to be a lady and fight Yi Zhiyang?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is the most troublesome part." Sun Yiyuan said: "The little guy used the Wuji Sword Qi when he fought against Rongrong. It is said that anyone who has competed with the Wuji Sword Qi will have a special smell on his body. Only the Wuji Sword Qi Only the user of Qi can smell it. The transformation technique can't deceive that little guy at all."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoche understood instantly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He sighed in his heart that his master had a thorough view of things. He was able to sit at the head of the consortium and build the Huaguo Shui Lian Group so well. Without two brushes, he really couldn't sit in this position.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And Jiang Xiaoche knows that his old man is actually very advanced, but he has never shown it to outsiders. Even Jiang Xiaoche has been on the list of assistants for so many years and has never seen Mr. Boss Sun take action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A few minutes later, Jiang Xiaoche saw the prompt from the building security team.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sir, they have arrived. They are downstairs." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Ask them to come up."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Yiyuan waved his hand. He didn't even raise his eyes. He continued to stare at the several calligraphy paintings on his desk and appreciate them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Over there, Jiang Xiaoche was just about to arrange work. Boss Sun suddenly stopped him: "Wait a minute."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Do you have any other instructions, sir?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I've seen enough of these calligraphy treasures. Take them out and ask someone to copy a few of them and give them away for me."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Who are you giving it to?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's the same people. Keep it secret."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes, sir."</p>
