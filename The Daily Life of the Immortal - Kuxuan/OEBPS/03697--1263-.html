  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1263 Magical Expert Consultation</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facts have proved that Guo Hao's intelligence does not contain any exaggeration.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Songhai City Qixing First Military Medical Hospital. Domestic experts gathered together.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Boss Sun has activated almost all his connections.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Within Songhai City alone, the first group of 17 experts was quickly assembled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These are all Taishan and Beidou-level figures in the world of cultivation medicine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Outside Songhai City, more experts from other places were invited. Anyone with free hands was called.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That night, Mr. Boss Sun launched twenty private immortal ships under the group, which were specially responsible for picking up and dropping off experts from other cities.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This movement was so huge that it was unprecedented.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The conference room on the top floor. Picture projected on the big screen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the left is Sun Rong lying in the medical cabin.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl's face was rosy. She closed her eyes quietly. She looked very peaceful. She didn't look sick at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the right side of the screen are real-time monitoring data from the medical cabin and scan results of the internal environment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The experts present frowned, pushed up their glasses, and stared deeply at the densely packed data panels in front of them.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Boss Sun was sitting in the center of the conference room. He crossed his fingers and said very nervously: "You are all the Big Dippers in the medical field. I don't know what everyone here has to say about my granddaughter..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In one night, Mr. Boss Sun seemed to have aged a lot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had just used up his family's strength to help the front line and assist in investigating the "Void Invasion".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Unexpectedly, after the void incident ended, there would be another wave.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Next to him, Liu Ping, the director of the military hospital, said: "Everyone has seen the current situation. Miss Sun has no obvious external or internal injuries. Her face is calm and her breathing is smooth."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"However, for some unknown reason, Ms. Sun's heartbeat and brain wave activity would stop abnormally, and then gradually recover...At first, the attacks occurred every one hour. Now the onset time is getting shorter and shorter. As of now Judging from the observation data, Miss Sun may be suffering from a neurological disease."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Dean Liu Ping turned his attention to an old doctor with gray hair and beard and a mole on his chin: "Dr. Zhao, you are an expert in cultivation neurology in China."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Back then, a Soul Formation cultivator was in love with a Foundation Building cultivator. As a result, due to the difference in strength, when the two were kissing, the Soul Formation master used too much force and sucked the tongue of the Foundation Building cultivator. Come out...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If it hadn't been for Dr. Zhao's nerve-wracking efforts to turn the tide, this female nun would have lost her tongue forever. Regarding this disease, please tell me your opinion first."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Dr. Zhao turned the pen in his hand and shook his head helplessly: "I have tested Miss Sun's nerves. Everything is stable. It does not look like a sick person at all. I have been practicing medicine for hundreds of years and have never seen such symptoms."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, Dr. Zhao turned his attention to a slightly rich female doctor and said: "Dr. Qian is a famous gynecological surgeon. He used only a scalpel to cut into the Nascent Soul stage. He took out the fetus that had a physical conflict with the Nascent Soul in the nun's belly...I don't know. From the perspective of a gynecologist, how does Dr. Qian view this matter?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is no need to mention what happened back then."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Dr. Qian smiled modestly: "I have fully understood Miss Sun's condition and believe that the disease Miss Sun suffers from is not a gynecological disease."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have been exposed to thousands of strange gynecological cases over the years. But they are all caused by the unclean lifestyle of female cultivators. Ms. Sun Rong has always been clean and tidy, which further rules out gynecological diseases. possibility."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The female doctor named Qian sighed slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, she turned her gaze to Boss Sun: "I don't know. Is Mr. Sun hiding something?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hearing this, Mr. Boss Sun's hole shrank.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He indeed hid something about the "Yin Yang Death Tribulation".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As early as the time when Sun Rong came to the hospital for examination after the Jiulong Mountain Competition, he had already found countless fortune tellers to calculate the curse.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, no one has deduced that Sun Rong was cursed...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But if this matter is related to the "Yin and Yang Death Tribulation".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then the only way is to find the person who cast the curse and solve the problem from the root.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And if we tell the whole story here, if this matter spreads, it will undoubtedly be an attempt to alert the enemy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Boss Sun could not imagine the consequences.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the daze, Jiang Xiaoche who was standing next to him suddenly listened and muttered softly: "Lord Diu Lei, please see me. He is already waiting in another conference room."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I know. I'll go right away."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boss Sun nodded.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm sorry. Everyone."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, Mr. Boss Sun stood up, faced all the doctors, and bowed deeply: "I would like to ask you all to work together to find out the cause and save my granddaughter..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He stood up and left the meeting room. Boss Sun's expression was obviously melancholy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He didn't know if he was right to conceal the "Yin Yang Death Tribulation".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I don’t even know if Lord Diu Lei can bring him any new opportunities.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although no evidence was found, he still firmly believed that this matter must be related to the "Yin Yang Death Tribulation".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Mr. Sun, please stay."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just when Mr. Boss Sun was about to meet Lord Diu Lei, a female doctor walked out of the Number 1 conference room quickly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Boss Sun took a look at the identity plate on the female doctor's chest. He saw the word "Liu Min" written on it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The origin of this female doctor suddenly came to mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He remembered that Dr. Liu Min was an expert in respiratory medicine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Dr. Liu, do you have anything to say?" Boss Sun asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I think this matter may not be solved from a medical perspective."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Dr. Liu said: "I'll make a long story short. I treated a boy more than ten years ago. This boy also had unexplained fever. The fever didn't go away. But no symptoms were found. I became suspicious. This boy might be... He's been cursed."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"But the experts from the Curse Relief Department have also consulted. They didn't see the problem either." Boss Sun's haggard face showed a bit of despair.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There are all kinds of strange spells and powerful spells. Even experts may not be able to see them. Let's take the boy who came to me for treatment as an example. Our hospital did not have a curse-breaking department at that time. But later this matter came to my attention. With the recommendation, it was properly resolved." Dr. Liu Min said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How to solve it?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I don't know. Mr. Sun, have you ever heard of a Zen master named Jin Deng?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">PS: (For a review of Zen Master Jin Deng’s past. Please see Chapter 968 {The origin of Chen Chao’s opening of the mouth})</p>
