  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1272 Bricks made of reincarnation and memory</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He broke the door with just one finger...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk originally thought that he and the boy would be evenly matched opponents.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, when he saw Wang Ling break the goal with just one finger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The shocking feeling that made the pupils tremble. It can no longer be described in words.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei sits aside.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He never had any doubts about the young man's strength.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Brother, you are still as strong as ever...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">From the time he met him to now. It's the same as always.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest, when Wang Ling's fingers touched the door of the temple, he was actually a little surprised in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There has never been an opponent in this world that could make him serious.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And the Zen Master Jin Deng in the Kaiguang Temple may be one.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But after breaking the door, the hint of surprise that arose in Wang Ling's heart was immediately extinguished...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I have heard the name of Ling Zhenren for a long time. If Ling Zhenren can successfully enter my great palace, I will tell you everything I know!" At this time, Jin Deng, who had closed his eyes and knocked on the wooden fish, finally opened his eyes. Open your own eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei had never had the opportunity to meet the monk's eyes before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now, he saw this Zen Master Jin Deng and opened his eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Those are a pair of stunning golden eyes. They seem to have the power to wash away all the bad karma in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But there is one thing to say.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei felt that it was still far from the shocking feeling he had when he first saw King's Eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Swastika..." Wang Ling only saw the back of Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he already knew that the other party had opened the "Swastika" which is known as the sage of Buddhism and Taoism.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Master Jin Deng is the sage of Buddhism. He condensed the energy of each reincarnation into his own pupils.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now, he has gone through 3910 reincarnations.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are 3910 pupils over there.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now. Wang Ling seems to understand why Zen Master Jin Deng is so interested in his "King's Eyes".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a serious contact lens enthusiast.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This "Swastika" is the natal object that Zen Master Jin Deng is proud of.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It can wash away all malice in the world, gain insight into human reincarnation, and detect human weaknesses.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He condensed his 3910 reincarnation experiences into this small "Swastika".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And his swastika is a collection of mistakes he has made in these reincarnations, like a collection of wrong questions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Those mistakes in decision-making in battle, mistakes in positioning...all kinds of wrong battle experiences turned into the torrent of history and gathered in the eyes of Zen Master Jin Deng. He kept these mistakes firmly in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The purpose is to avoid making mistakes in the next reincarnation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now. The moment Wang Ling steps into the threshold.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The "Swastika" that had not bloomed for a long time exerted its magical power at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It starts to resonate with every floor tile in the atrium!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stepped on the first floor tile of the atrium.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is the pressure of Zen Master Jin Deng’s first reincarnation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling saw the memory fragment of the monk's first life cycle...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this clip is just a flashback.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I only saw one person in Le. He was knocking on wooden fish...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moreover, this close-up shot is placed on this wooden fish.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling doesn’t understand its meaning.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He took another step forward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Step 2. The pressure is indeed greater than before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These floor tiles in the atrium. The further you go, the greater the pressure will be.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The samsara pressure contained in the floor tiles behind you will continue to accumulate upwards.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is impossible for one person to accept such a huge amount of information in a short period of time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"No matter how powerful a person is, it is impossible for him to bear the memory of thousands of reincarnations in a short period of time." Zen Master Jin Deng smiled slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Lord Diu Lei came in, it was just a formality.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now that Wang Ling is here, he naturally receives him with the "highest standard".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Swastika. Concentrates the mental stress caused by all his reincarnations. It is spread out by these floor tiles in the atrium...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">No one can withstand such terrifying power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lord Diu Lei looked outside the court.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he did not doubt the power of Wang Ling, the young man in front of him seemed to be really in trouble.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He walked step by step in the atrium. He walked very slowly...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"True Lord, if your friend refuses to admit defeat for the sake of face, you can communicate and finally convey it to the poor monk. The poor monk will not laugh." Zen Master Jin Deng looked like he was winning.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The mental pressure brought by the swastika is so great. How could he not know?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now the young man has just walked one-tenth of the way.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This one-tenth of the road is covered by the mental pressure of 391 reincarnations!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In one reincarnation, he lived for at least a hundred years, and at most for thousands of years. Only those who have experienced this kind of pressure can truly understand. Zen Master Jin Deng sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's a pity. This young man is not Dao Ancestor Wang after all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If it were Dao Ancestor Wang himself, it would never be so difficult.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling admits. I walk really slowly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in fact, he didn't feel much mental pressure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This can be seen from his thick hair.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He walked very slowly, deliberately stepping on every floor tile. Partly for fun.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other hand, I also want to investigate the origin of the monk through the memory flashback triggered by stepping on the floor tiles.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's a pity. He stepped on hundreds of floor tiles. Those fragmented flashbacks cannot be pieced together into a complete memory.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I can only say that the origins of the monks in the Main Hall are indeed extraordinary.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it seems. It's not as powerful as Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He walked leisurely on every floor tile, peeking at the flashbacks of each life of the monk. The headache he felt was not even as much as the pressure brought to him before the final exam of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This makes Wang Ling sincerely disappointed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He opened his hand. There was a gathering of earth-colored spiritual energy on his palm.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zen Master Jin Deng noticed this scene in the atrium.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Soon he discovered that the young man was actually using his spiritual power to absorb elements from the world and imitate the floor tiles in his atrium, creating an identical adobe brick.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The monk suddenly laughed: "Want to imitate the poor monk and integrate the experience of reincarnation into bricks?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling has no answer.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He has no reincarnation experience.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because this life is his first life experience... He has not yet caught up with reincarnation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What he did was just integrate his sixteen years of experience into this brick.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If he could live to be 1,600 years old, then the experience contained in this brick would be the experience of one hundredth lifetime.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If he can live to be sixteen thousand years old, then the experience in this brick is the experience of one thousandth of his life...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course. Wang Ling doesn’t know how long he can live.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But compared to his long life, the experiences he has in his hands are definitely a drop in the ocean.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Comparing the various experiences of Zen Master Jin Deng in 3910 reincarnations, they are just a drop in the bucket.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, he didn't mind sharing what he had experienced over the years with this Zen master.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After gathering the bricks in his hand, Wang Ling threw them towards Zen Master Jin Deng from a distance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's a small trick..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Zen master didn't even look at it. He raised his hand and caught it directly with his hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then there is no more.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The memory brick thrown by Wang Ling. The huge mental pressure contained in it was poured directly into the mind of Zen Master Jin Deng.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It only lasted a moment. The Zen master's whole body twitched. At the same time, he was bleeding from all his orifices. He was shaking like crazy as if he had been electrocuted...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jin Deng couldn't believe the torrent of horrific memories flooding into his mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That's right...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is the function...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His mind was filled with functions...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And overwhelming...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just noodles...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And... raccoons...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What has this young man experienced?</p>
