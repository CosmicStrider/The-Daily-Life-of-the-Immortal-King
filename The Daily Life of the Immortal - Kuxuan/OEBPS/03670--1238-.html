  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1238 The Frightening Fool</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Half an hour before the foundation meeting starts.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Book of Sage Immortal has deduced the identity of the "Fool" messenger among the seven messengers.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It is also recommended that Wang Ling use the "temporary body seizing technique" to enter the body of this fool.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This kind of seizure is temporary. A short-term soul exchange can be achieved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The advantage is that you can infiltrate seamlessly without being discovered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Therefore. Wang Ling is not a real fool.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But what Wang Ling didn't expect was.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His habit of stealing snacks raised questions among several other messengers at the scene.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But fortunately, he hasn't been completely exposed yet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The most important reason is that Xubai does not believe that the person who is the Fool is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There's no way it's this person...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For a moment, the three words "impossible" were displayed back and forth in Xu Bai's mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Based on the information he investigated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The Fool's true identity is a woodcutter living in the deep mountains and forests. His name is Joyce Tanlang.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Joyce Tanlang is very powerful, but has a miserable life experience.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I have a sister who has been possessed by an evil spirit since childhood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This overbearing evil spirit has been entrenched in his sister's body all year round and refuses to come out.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In addition to working hard to practice, Joyce became stronger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, he is also looking for a way to rid his sister of the evil spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But unfortunately, Joyce took too long.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The evil spirit and his sister have merged spiritually. Now they are indistinguishable from each other.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Joyce wanted to keep her sister alive.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had to live with his sister in the deep mountains where there is abundant spiritual energy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because of this, Joyce's mental space signal has always been unstable.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And this is the reason why this messenger of the Fool often leaves the meeting in the middle of the meeting.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. Let’s ask a woodcutter who lives in the mountains all year round with his sister who is possessed by an evil spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Why do you suddenly have the habit of eating snacks?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Xu Bai had doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But he didn't believe the woodcutter in the Fool position.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is the man whom he longs for revenge.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He has carefully planned everything. This plan has not yet been officially launched.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All actions should be seamless.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That man couldn't have imagined that he was the mastermind behind it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So. There must be a mistake somewhere.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Or maybe Lord of the Void missed some of Joyce's habits...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If this is a woodcutter who loves snacks, it seems to make sense.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Joyce sacrificed so much for her sister.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Visited so many powerful beings and sought out secret recipes in remote places to relieve evil spirits.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">You must have your own pressure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some people relieve stress by typing on the keyboard;</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some people drink whiskey;</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Some people rely on recommendation votes and monthly votes;</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are also people who shamelessly rely on dragging to relieve stress;</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course, it is not ruled out that some people rely on snacks to relieve stress.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nervously swallowing the saliva accumulated in his mouth, Xu Bai spoke at this time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Fool. Don't you... have nothing to say?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He still firmly believed in the Lord of the Void's judgment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was confirmed that the messenger sitting in seat 7 was the old woodcutter Joyce.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Not the man he wants revenge on.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is vain. He is not vain at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the best time for revenge has not yet come.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He just needs a little more time to prepare.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I agree. Chariot's opinion."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Finally, a voice came from the Fool's position.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This slightly rough voice made Xu Bai let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was sure it was Joyce's voice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And his tone of voice was exactly the same as Joyce's.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Then. Six votes for Chariot and one vote for the Sun. The foundation will formulate follow-up plans based on Chariot's suggestions."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Speaking of this, in the spiritual space, Xu Bai made the final decision.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This meeting has come to an end.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the bedroom of the Wang family's small villa. Wang Ling opened his eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the last moment of the meeting just now, Wang Ling canceled his "Temporary Body Seizing Technique".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The body was returned to its original owner Joyce Tanlon.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a good brother who knows how to cherish his sister.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling doesn’t want to get Joyce in trouble because of his own reasons.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He has signed a soul contract with Joyce, retaining the right to come to him at any time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In return. Wang Ling will agree to help Joyce cure his sister.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although the evil ghost has soul-fused with his sister.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But for Wang Ling, peeling off the evil spirit is just a snap of the finger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Facing the upper body of Wang Ling, Joyce was of course moved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt that his perseverance in abandoning his sister over the years had moved God and received God's salvation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After Wang Ling releases the upper body state.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Joyce knelt on his knees, looked up at the sky with his hands in prayer, and thanked God for Shengze with the most pious eyes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Joyce: "Lord! Thank you Lord! If the Lord would use my body! You're welcome to call me anytime.!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Is it done?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time Wang Ling turned his attention to the tablet on the desktop.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although Wang Ling already had the idea of giving it away.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">so.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Send it. It must be sent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Apple Aid is still useful for the time being.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"During the time when I was in the Lord's body, I had figured out the identities of several people in the spiritual space."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The book of Sage Immortal states the results of its own deductions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The seven people in the foundation are all foreign cultivators.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these foreign cultivators may be colluding with the General Alliance.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Among them, the collusion probability of tanks is as high as 87%. It is the object of key observation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling clicked on the tank’s information.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The true full name of the chariot envoy was discovered: Toy Delray.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is the boss of a multinational spirit sword production company. He controls more than twenty giant spirit sword production and processing factories.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Every year, some of the mass-produced spirit swords in the Huaxiu Kingdom are obtained from Toy Delray.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What surprised Wang Ling even more.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This Toy Del Rey actually seems to be related by blood to a person Wang Ling knows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Inferred based on bloodline analysis in the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Toy Del Rey's DNA is highly similar to Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Two people. Actually have a father-son relationship?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Yi Zhiyang has been alone since he was a child.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was after General Yi took a fancy to his talent and accepted him as his disciple.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Life is gradually getting better.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest, without this bloodline data.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang LingIt’s hard to imagine that Yi Zhiyang has foreign ancestry.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seems that Yi Zhiyang may have inherited a little more of his mother's genes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And his mother is definitely an authentic oriental beauty.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Continue investigating."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling continues to give orders to the Book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He needs to know who Yi Zhiyang's mother is.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As long as his mother is within the scope of the earth, through comparison with large databases, there are always possible clues to be found.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It may take a while to find it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But Wang Ling has plenty of time now.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In fact. In this information currently provided by the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling also found another interesting set of data.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That is the inference about the identity of Judgment Messenger Number 4.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although the Sage Immortal Book gave a 76% probability to a person named "Michelle".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But there is still a probability of 24 shown.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This "Michelle" has most likely been transferred.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Bai Zhe."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling stared at this familiar name. He smiled in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He didn't expect that Xiaoqiang's vitality would be so tenacious.</p>
