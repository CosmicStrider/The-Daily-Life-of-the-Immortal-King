  <h1>Chapter 94 The Most Horrifying Thing </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Lie Mengmeng left, Father Wang rummaged around in the store room at home and found a vintage rosewood box. This was a burial object which the old man had prepared for himself in advance and which he had asked Father Wang to bury with him once his time was up.</p>

    <p>Father Wang knew that the box contained a lot of the old man's secrets. After the latter had started suffering from dementia, he had left the rosewood box with Father Wang in case he forgot about it one day, with repeated warnings to not open it. But now, for the sake of curing the old man's dementia, Father Wang really had no other choice.</p>

    <p>"You, like a drop of rain, nourish my heart; you, like a rainbow, capture my gaze; you, like a bright moon, seep radiantly into my heart, like a torrential stream that falls into a beautiful waterfall; I wish to take your hand, to run and jump beneath the setting sun, to execute a graceful bicycle kick.</p>

    <p>"Ah~ I like you. I like your cool attitude toward my small tricks; I like how quickly you speak; when I go shopping for clothes with you, I like it when you act small and confused. Crossing the road hand in hand with you, we don't have to go too far, since our next stop is happiness."</p>

    <p>In the study, Father Wang read this love letter aloud. The old man had written this on a sheet of oil paper in his youth; the immature handwriting could only just be made out on it.</p>

    <p>Both Father Wang and Wang Ling shuddered in unison, and even Er Ha's fur stood on end... fuck, this type of love letter, which mixed together sentences from the compositions of primary school students and popular song lyrics â€” could someone really confess with this?!</p>

    <p>Er Ha sincerely doubted how effective this love letter could have been.</p>

    <p>Father Wang pointed at the stack of letters inside the box. Every single one of them had been penned by the old man in a variety of styles. Everyone knew that in his youth, the old man had been a patron saint of love whose history of love affairs was much richer than Father Wang's. Moreover, the old man was good at matching the solution to the problem, and would change his writing style in his love letters according to his lovers' personalities and tastes.</p>

    <p>After going through several letters, Father Wang had finally found this letter to first love written in a fresh, literary style.</p>

    <p>Apart from it, there were letters in a demure and nostalgic style, such as:</p>

    <p>"You are the white clouds and I am the black dirt. Whether you are seventy-one years old or I'm seventy-five years old... I will take your hand and grow old with you. When I'm old, I will still board your worn ship with my old boat ticket..."</p>

    <p>There were letters in a nerdish style, such as:</p>

    <p>"I will forever be, the lonely square root of three <sup>1</sup> . The three is as beautiful a number as can be. But under the ugly square root sign, how I wish I were a nine. For with a little arithmetic, nine could thwart this evil trick. But if this square root sign were you, I would agree to be a two, so that you could divide me endlessly..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from a poem written by computer science teacher David Feinberg. The square room of three is an irrational number, and the poem ponders on loneliness by using irrational numbers as a framework ..)</dfn>

    <p>Finally, there were letters in a flirtatious and forceful style, such as:</p>

    <p>"I hope one day, you can teach me a lesson on my round bottom with your gentle hands; I hope you can kiss my red-hot biceps with your sexy red lips..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After reading these love letters, Father Wang finally understood why the old man had already sorted out his burial object and solemnly told him not to open it. After all, these things were really shameful. The old man could never have imagined that before his dark history could be buried with him, it would be uncovered and read one by one by his son and grandson.</p>

    <p>Closing the box, Father Wang passed the letter to first love to Wang Ling. "Is there a way to track down your grandfather's first love?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned with some hesitation.</p>

    <p>Currently, the only people who had touched this letter were Wang Ling himself, Father Wang, the old man and that slightly green girl.</p>

    <p>Out of the Three Thousand Great Spells, the Great Recollection Spell could use an object to track down the location of an individual who had touched it before. But it had two conditions. First, the person who touched it must still be alive. Second, Wang Ling must have seen the person before.</p>

    <p>Putting the first condition aside, the second one was a big problem. If this was a normal situation, Wang Ling could definitely use his memory retrieval ability to search the old man's memory for the slightly green girl's features, and in reverse order, track her down to her current location.</p>

    <p>But the old man's memory was now muddled by his dementia. If Wang Ling used the memory retrieval skill, he would only see something similar to the white noise on TV. And even if he pushed forward searching for clues, after so many years, no one could say for sure how much of that "slightly green" girl was left in the old man's memory. Conversely, there was the risk that it could aggravate his dementia.</p>

    <p>Father Wang again thrust the letter under Wang Ling's nose. "How about sniffing it out? Most likely some of that slightly green girl's scent is still on the letter."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." <em>There is an actual fucking dog here, why the hell are you asking me to do the sniffing?!</em></p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched, but because he was afraid that Father Wang would unfairly dock his pocket money again, he stifled the urge to argue with him. Instead, he dodged the letter so that it got passed to Er Ha. Given the current situation, he could only rely on this guy. After all, Er Ha had been learning to be a dog for so long and Wang Ling felt it was now necessary to test the results of its training.</p>

    <p>Previously, when it had still been a toad, it had practiced mouth techniques, and was best at tongue skills.</p>

    <p>Now that it had turned into a dog, Er Ha's cultivation path had naturally changed.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that a dog's nose was very sharp. As a demon king, Er Ha was trying hard to adapt to its current body.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling passed it the letter, Er Ha sniffed it carefully, and suddenly felt that the scent on it seemed familiar somehow.</p>

    <p>Was there really a result already?</p>

    <p>Too amazing!</p>

    <p>Seeing Er Ha's reaction, Father Wang felt sincerely moved in his heart.</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha understood human language, this current body was still a hindrance in the end, and it hadn't yet cultivated to the point that it could speak. Everything had to go through Wang Ling's Mind-Reading Ability before Wang Ling could pass word on to Father Wang. After he had heard Er Ha's reply, slight surprise flashed across Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's eyebrow twitched involuntarily as he looked at Wang Ling. "You're saying... Er Ha said that it's smelled the scent on the letter before at Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded, and Father Wang's expression cleared as he instantly slapped his hands together. "Your grandfather did mention, back then, that girl graduated with a teaching major. True, there's a real chance she has continued teaching in school! But who on earth is that female teacher?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang's curiosity had been completely aroused.</p>

    <p>His family's old man had a first love who unexpectedly turned out to be a teacher at his son's school?</p>

    <p>To be able to catch the old man's eye, the girl must have been an enchanting beauty when she was young! Furthermore, from the fresh, literary style in that letter to first love, Father Wang could almost immediately picture a pure and lovely maiden with long and elegant hair in his mind... even if she was old now, she still at least had to be an attractive existence for her age!</p>

    <p>But this was just Father Wang's assumption. Wang Ling had seen almost all the teachers at Number 60 High School; if you were looking for a mature, attractive person...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that Teacher Wang could be counted as one... as for other people...</p>

    <p>He shuddered in spite of himself, and didn't dare to continue this line of thinking.</p>

    <p>No matter how he thought about it, it made him feel indescribably flustered.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was late at night. Under the cover of darkness, Wang Ling instantly teleported to Number 60 High School with Er Ha. Following its lead, he drew up in front of the door to one of the teachers' offices, which was for teachers of the elite classes. Wang Ling had seen most of them; there were many female teachers, but as for those who were mature and attractive... he blanked on who it could be.</p>

    <p>Then he instantly teleported inside the office with Er Ha. Huddled in Wang Ling's clothes, it lifted its nose and sniffed...</p>

    <p>It was over there...</p>

    <p>It directed Wang Ling toward an office desk.</p>

    <p>Right after that, Wang Ling felt like he had encountered the most horrifying thing ever in his life so far.</p>

    <p>Because this office desk... actually fucking belonged to Teacher Pan!</p>
