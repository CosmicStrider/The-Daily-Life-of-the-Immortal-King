  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling and Sun Rong basically experienced all the equipment in the arcade on the third floor.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Whack-a-mole machine. The contraction frequency of the mole was modified by Jiang Xiaoche. After the machine was turned on, the mole's head shrank back and forth like a ghost video. Wang Ling held a small hammer. Unexpectedly, he kept up. The speed at which the gopher shrank set a record in the history of the gopher machine.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This... why can a man's hand move up and down so fast? This is unscientific!" Jiang Xiaoche was furious when he saw it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This kid's hand speed is just like my style back then!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Why did I intentionally shrink the frame of the shooting machine? He can still shoot in!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wonderful! This is probably a condensed version of the legendary shot on earth. Through the extremely short-distance acceleration of gravity, the power of the basketball when it falls is greatly increased. This achieves the purpose of throwing the ball in while the basket is not paying attention! "</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Master, wake up! The machines in the medical boxing room seem to have been damaged! This machine is very expensive!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This machine has been beaten by so many people. It is normal for it to be in disrepair! The young man may have just added the last blow. This not only proves his luck. It is also obviously very manly! It has the demeanor of my old man. ..To deal with the kind of medical troublemakers who are just looking for trouble, you should teach them a lesson like this!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Master..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Okay. Stop talking! You are an upright man. You are doing things behind your back. Everyone gets through the difficulties like others. What is wrong here? Why are you pretending to be pitiful?" Mr. Boss Sun looked at Wang Ling. The more I watch it, the more I find Wang Ling cute. The more I watch it, the more I like it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jiang Xiaoche: "???"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I said goodbye to Sun Rong and returned home. It was already 7pm.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling I didn’t expect that it would take me so long to play a video game.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's not entirely without gain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At least I got a lot of points Wang Ling from the arcade.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This afternoon, he successively climbed to the top of the list of various devices.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The points for these rewards. Wang Ling can be redeemed for snack rewards at any similar arcade in Songhai City.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are quite a few chain stores of this arcade. They are found in various areas of Songhai City. There is one on the student street next to Number 60 High School. Wang Ling plans to check it out after school this week.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wang Ling knew that he was a bit high-profile when he topped the video game arcade rankings. This was not in line with his style. But there was no way.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">People. There are always things they cannot control.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Especially when Wang Ling knew that points can be redeemed for snacks. He was instantly attracted to it!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, Wang Ling did not leave his real name on the video arcade ranking list. He gave himself a pseudonym: Aqian...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And what Wang Ling never expected was.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His nickname "Aqian" soon became a legend in the arcade...</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Wednesday, November 25th. It’s finally Wang Ling’s turn to go to school normally.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After two days of adjustment, the other people's mental state was obviously much better. But Wang Ling still looked like he was tired.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wang LingAh. Your face doesn't seem to be very good?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's okay..." Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There is no other reason. Mainly because I was tired yesterday.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Following the map planned by Mother Wang and Father Wang, he traveled around the entire earth as quickly as possible. Using his ability to self-purify human flesh, he basically eliminated the new influenza virus that was prevalent recently.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Not only that. Wang Ling also speculates that one day in the future, some people in the world of cultivation began to develop curiosity about the outside of the universe. They over-exploited unknown ores from other planets and attempted to bring them back to Earth for research. Thus, I accidentally unblocked these viruses hidden in the cosmic ore...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So Wang Ling took another trip outside the Earth and purified hundreds of galaxies near the Earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">By the time Wang Ling rushed back to Earth, it was already morning.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He directly changed into his school uniform and ran to class seamlessly. He didn't even have time to rest.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, Wang Ling is also very capable of adjustment. He only needs to sit down and calm down for ten minutes to regain his energy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, it is still early self-study time. There is enough time for Wang Ling to rest.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As for learning matters, although Teacher Pan compiled and reissued the class videos during their two days of vacation, Wang Ling did not watch even a second.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even watching videos at 2x speed is a waste of time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For Wang Ling, the fastest way to learn is to use his {Quantum Wave Speed Reading Technique}.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The first class on Wednesday was a history class. Mr. Wang Zukang walked into the classroom. He wanted Sun Rong to help pass out the review outline. Only then did he find that Sun Rong's seat was empty. .</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Has classmate Sun Rong not recovered yet?" Mr. Wang Zukang asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It seems like I'm still observing." Su Xiao raised her hand and replied.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Are you still observing..." Mr. Wang Zukang frowned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had actually checked Sun Rong's injury before. In fact, it was not that serious.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Intuition told Mr. Wang Zukang. Huaguo Shui Lian that the group might be worried about something and kept Sun Rong in the hospital.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nominally for observation. Actually for protection.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After all, Sun Rong has attracted shadow stream killers before. But this time she became famous through the battle with Yi Zhiyang in the national competition. There is indeed a certain probability of arousing the jealousy of some people. Taking advantage of Sun RongThe "injured" opportunity strikes again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the problem is that there hasn't been much movement in the killer world recently.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang was puzzled.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Ever since he and Taotie Taoist reconciled, under their unified coordination, there has never been any trouble in the world of killers.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Nowadays, the entire world of professional killers is about to become a professional team that fights crime and exposes fraud!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even helping the old lady cross the street, there were people rushing to do it!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So...maybe there are other reasons for this?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Putting this issue aside for the time being, Mr. Wang Zukang decided to go to class first.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He picked a brand new piece of chalk from the podium. He turned around his plump body and wrote today's class content on the blackboard.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And these four words. Wang Ling are actually familiar.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Ghost Ax Spirit Mother."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mr. Wang Zukang played with the chalk tip in his hand. He introduced the four words on the blackboard with some pride on his face: "Does anyone know who the Ghost Ax Spirit Mother is? For those who know, the teacher can reward spicy strips. ."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As soon as he finished speaking, the whole class fell silent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">According to the normal class process, Mr. Wang Zukang began to call the roll and asked people to answer: "Guo Hao. Do you know?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To be honest, this question really stumped Guo Hao.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When he saw Mr. Wang Zukang writing four words, he was about to send a text message to his uncle for help.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Guo Hao: "Teacher...I don't know."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That Gu Shunzhi. Do you know?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Teacher, I don't know either..." Gu Shunzhi shook his head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"...".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Wang Ling really wanted to answer "that's my mother".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But even if you say it out loud, someone has to believe it!</p>
