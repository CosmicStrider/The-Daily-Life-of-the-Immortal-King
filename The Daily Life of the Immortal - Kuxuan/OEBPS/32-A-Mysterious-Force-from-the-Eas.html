  <h1>Chapter 32 A Mysterious Force from the East </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Located behind the teaching building, Number 59 High School's dormitory was also newly-built with four stories and could accommodate four people in each room. Each floor had one washroom and ten bedrooms, and the building could hold up to one hundred and sixty students.</p>

      <p>Walking ahead of them, Tang Jingze led the team from Number 60 High School inside.</p>

      <p>So the spirit gathering arrays in the teaching building weren't working — no matter! The ones in the new dormitory were also newly-built! They were laid in the same structure as the ones in the teaching building, four circular spirit gathering arrays with one on each floor. The higher the floor, the more powerful the array!</p>

      <p>No matter what, he had to show these bumpkins from Number 60 High School the joint might of the circular spirit gathering arrays!</p>

      <p>Lost in thought, Tang Jingze stepped past the school dormitory's automatic gate, then rapidly activated spirit energy and cycled it once through his body.</p>

      <p>Soon after, he heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>

      <p>He could clearly sense the vast reserves of spirit energy around them, which meant that the spirit gathering arrays were functioning at the moment! Very good, there should be no problems after this...</p>

      <p>Delighted, Tang Jingze waved the team from Number 60 High School inside with fully undisguised pomposity.</p>

      <p>It was at this moment that Wang Ling, at the back of the group, walked through the gate...</p>

      <p>At the same time, a heavy thud resounded throughout the building.</p>

      <p>Then.</p>

      <p>The spirit gathering arrays at Number 59 High School's dormitory...</p>

      <p>Exploded, just like that...</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>At that moment, Tang Jingze could no longer hold back his impulse to curse.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze had to be supported by the three young masters of the Liang Family as they returned to the Student Union Office.</p>

      <p>"President..." No one had ever seen Tang Jingze dazed like this.</p>

      <p>They had adopted the same strategy with those people from Number 58 High School a few weeks ago. When they had entered the dormitory to register, Tang Jingze had played a little trick on them which they hadn't been able to resolve.</p>

      <p>But the situation now was upside down. Tang Jingze thumped the table furiously. "The senior who set up the school's new spirit gathering arrays previously said that they would last ten years or so. It hasn't even been one year, how can they all blow up in one day?"</p>

      <p>"..." Fang Huaqing, Liang Wei and the others also felt it was a little strange.</p>

      <p>"There's something unusual about the Number 60 High School team... President, how about we just leave it be?" Liang Wei suggested softly.</p>

      <p>"Leave it be??" Tang Jingze sneered. How could he leave it be?! He had been completely slapped in the face three times today! Once at the entrance to the teaching building, another time in the teaching building itself, and yet another time in the school dormitory!</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze had never felt this useless and vexed in his whole life; from primary school to middle school, he had always been the class leader and president of the student union, the top dog in social circles inside and outside the school — they were just a bunch of country bumpkins, he would definitely find some way to deal with them!</p>

      <p>He consoled himself with this thought.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Although the school dormitory was new, Number 59 High School was only going to officially open it next year. At present, there were only six students, including Wang Ling, staying in this massive four-story school dorm.</p>

      <p>A room had been arranged for the two girls Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu at the end of the corridor. Wang Ling, the other three people, and a parrot, would be staying next door.</p>

      <p>It was Wang Ling's first time sharing a room and space with other people for the night — and it was going to be for three whole nights...</p>

      <p>Just thinking about it gave Wang Ling a real headache. Previously, in case of something unforeseen happening, Wang Ling had always done his utmost to avoid this sort of situation.</p>

      <p>"What happened today was really a little strange; was it really by chance?" The dorm was equipped with loft beds that had tables underneath them. Chen Chao casually jumped up onto a bed, swinging his swarthy legs back and forth as he asked the question.</p>

      <p>"It was beyond explanation." Teacher Wang shook his head.</p>

      <p>Although it was the scientific age of cultivation, there were still some things that science couldn't explain.</p>

      <p>Like what happened today... who could have predicted that the twelve new spirit gathering arrays which Number 59 High School had set up less than a year ago would all blow up?</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Teacher Wang didn't think that these arrays had been shoddily built at all, since in the last few years, Huaxiu nation had been cracking down heavily on poor workmanship.</p>

      <p>For example, shortly after well-known international brand Nike had released their newest limited-edition flying sword, a public complaint had been filed in Chaoyang district of Songhai city that the sword's hilt didn't contain the shock-absorbing air cushion as advertised!</p>

      <p>In the end, Nike had been fined a billion yuan by the Consumer Product Safety Office as a severe warning to others.</p>

      <p>There were plenty of companies which specialized in laying down spirit gathering arrays in schools. Compared with manufacturing limited-edition flying swords, the overall costs for setting up a spirit gathering array were way lower. Yet if they truly received a fine, Teacher Wang felt that no company would be able to bear the huge penalty.</p>

      <p>Who would dare challenge the government on its "shut down and eliminate counterfeits" stance during this critical time?</p>

      <p>"Does Student Wang Ling have an opinion on this?" Teacher Wang looked at Wang Ling and asked.</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ling hadn't expected Teacher Wang to pass the question to him.</p>

      <p>He had been feeling a little guilty, and in this situation, if he didn't say something... wouldn't that obviously look a little strange?</p>

      <p>Therefore, after calmly giving it careful consideration, Wang Ling said what was likely the longest sentence he had ever spoken in his life, "Maybe it was a mysterious force from the east <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is like a catchphrase used to describe something unique or amazing to come out of China.)</dfn>

      <p>After that, everyone was lost in enigmatic thought. "..."</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>It was the third week of school, and half past one on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong knocked gently on the door of the adjacent room; she had specially come to inform them of a student union exchange activity at two o'clock.</p>

      <p>As the teacher-in-charge, Teacher Wang was mainly responsible for their safety and that important spirit sword exchange meet. As the class monitor, Sun Rong would handle everything else.</p>

      <p>It was worth mentioning that she was fairly efficient at getting things done. Whatever arrangements she made would definitely be carried out flawlessly. Because of that, the team didn't have to worry, and could leave everything to her.</p>

      <p>"Is everyone resting?" Sun Rong whispered.</p>

      <p>Teacher Wang, who was normally lazy outside of office hours, had actually decided not to take a nap, and instead was making a lot of plans for the grand finale, the spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

      <p>He jerked a thumb at the three sleeping boys and gestured for her to be quiet. "You can let me know what's going on."</p>

      <p>"The first student union exchange activity will take place in Room 2002 at two o'clock," Sun Rong whispered.</p>

      <p>"Alright, Student Sun Rong, I'll wake them up in a bit." Teacher Wang nodded.</p>

      <p>"Mm!" She blinked and glanced curiously around the guys' dormitory; the bed closest to the door was Wang Ling's.</p>

      <p>Right then, Wang Ling was lying supine on the bed with one arm under his head as he slept peacefully. His long eyelashes, steady breathing, and the slight tilt to the corners of his mouth... it looked like he was having a good dream.</p>

      <p>It was the first time that Sun Rong had seen Wang Ling's sleeping face, and it was completely different from his normally serious and taciturn expression in class.</p>

      <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is so cute!" Sun Rong's thoughts were sweet.</p>
