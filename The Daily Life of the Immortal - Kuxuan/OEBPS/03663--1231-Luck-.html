  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1231 The Scavenger of the Foundation</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"People have always been pursuing a higher level of evolution... Cultivators are struggling to pursue a higher level of realm. This is also the reason. Countless cultivators are pursuing a higher level of realm. It is for strength and longevity. It is also to pursue a higher level of life..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Inside the Office of Strategic Deception. Keorn is holding a cup of hot coffee and explaining what he knows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Apparently, he seems to be planning to start from the origin of human beings and cultivation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, time is running out now. Zhuo Yi can only provide guidance from the side. Let Keorn answer the key points.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In order to win Keorn's trust, Zhuo Yi even unlocked Keorn's soul-binding lock. But Keorn knew very well that the powerful man with long red hair was here. It made no difference whether he wore the lock or not. .</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You refused to say it before. Why are you willing to say it now?" Faced with Keorn's sudden change, Zhuo Yi felt suspicious.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Keorn looked at Zhuo Yi: "My purpose of joining the SBP Foundation is to enable the human world to develop in a more peaceful and orderly manner. The investigations I have done over the years are also based on this purpose. I will only choose. I think it's the right thing. In fact, I was still hesitating when I was sent to the prison car. But after the few waves of people fighting, I immediately understood it."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What did you understand?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I understand. The right direction." Keorn's voice gradually became deeper: "The Foundation has changed. It is no longer the Foundation I knew before. We originally existed to reveal the truth. Now the Foundation actually exists to hide The truth. Even at the cost of killing the investigators..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You mean that the real purpose of the group from the Foundation was not to kidnap you?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Even though they are disguised, I also know them. They are the scavengers of the Foundation." Keorn said: "The role of the scavengers is to assist in the investigation. They will cooperate with the investigators to perform specific tasks."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"For example, we sometimes kidnap specific insiders in order to investigate things. At the same time, in order to protect the identity of the insider, we will fake their suicide and take Zhenren away for investigation. In this way, in the eyes of the outside world, this The person is dead. However, in fact, once we have enough evidence, the dead person will come back as a key witness..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So. The scavenger's mission was originally to help you fake suicide?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's understandable."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Keorn nodded. He held the coffee cup and smiled bitterly: "But I don't know when it started. This scavenger began to change. I don't know when the foundation that originally exposed the truth became a lackey of some chaebols." . They sent investigators to investigate. Let the investigators collect all the witnesses and evidence, and then sent scavengers to destroy them all..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's a perfect fit."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi sighed: "When did they become like this? And when did you become aware of this?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"A long time ago... In my memory, it seems that it started 20 years ago... They started to corrupt 20 years ago... It's just that I had no concrete evidence before."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Keorn frowned. As if he was trying to recall every detail of the past few decades: "From the moment my first friend who was also an investigator died, I actually had doubts. And it wasn't until just now that I Officially confirmed. The scavengers in the Foundation have indeed changed."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Having said this, Keorn lowered his head. He cast a simple {impression spell} and projected the appearance of a blue-eyed foreigner on the drawing paper: "This man's name is Snake. The captain of the scavenger. Maybe even he can I don't know. I started to notice him after my first fellow investigator died. The moment he jumped out, I could clearly sense that he wanted to kill me."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"He is very strong? Even if you don't wear the spirit-binding chain, his level is not bad, right?" Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"We are all elites selected and cultivated by the foundation. Our level is not much different, but the focus of our cultivation is different."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Scavengers are killing machines cultivated by the Foundation...and most of us investigators focus on perception and auxiliary spells."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point, Zhuo Yi has a general understanding of the whole incident. When he was in Songhai Number 1 Prison, Keorn refused to let go. That was because he still had a glimmer of hope for the existence of the SBP Foundation. hope.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He firmly believed that the faith he once believed in would not collapse like that...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But after cutting off four people halfway, Keorn understood in an instant. The lofty foundation in his heart had been completely destroyed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I chose your Office of Strategic Deception because you don't have any interests involved with the Foundation. Remember, the other two people on the road..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You mean Huawei Shui Lian Group and General Alliance?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"If my inference is correct, they should have been infiltrated by the Foundation. In comparison, only the Office of Strategic Deception has a lower risk." Keorn said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo YiHearing this, I feel that the situation that was already clear seems to have become a little complicated again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The SBP Foundation has been established for so many years. It enjoys a good reputation internationally. I can understand that General Alliance may cooperate with it. But what about the Huaguo Shui Lian Group?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I'm not particularly clear about this matter. I've only heard a colleague mention relevant files about the Huaguo Shui Lian Group. This matter seems to be related to the female candidate of the Huaguo Shui Lian Group..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Sun Rong?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yes... that should be the name... but I don't know the specific content of the investigation." The expression on Keorn's face was particularly complicated: "Because this investigator... is rumored to have died in a scavenger. In hand..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Boom!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, as the conversation ended, a huge roar suddenly erupted outside the mountain gate of the Office of Strategic Deception. The True Venerated Immortal Hall of Lord Diu Lei also shook slightly with the huge earthquake.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"There is a report that a group of foreigners are preparing to attack the mountain!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A disciple from the Office of Strategic Deception ran in in a panic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's the scavenger! Snake and the others are coming!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Keorn became nervous: "They know you have experts here. They can't attack easily without complete preparation...Snake is very strong! He will definitely kill me!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't panic."Zhuo Yi tried to calm Keorn's emotions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He checked his eyes with the Immortal from Zhenyuan. The Immortal from Zhenyuan was about to go out to see the situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a result, at this time, another disciple from the Office of Strategic Deception ran in in a panic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The foreigner who took the lead is dead!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Dead???"Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said it was a needle. It came from a distance. It passed by like a meteor. It stabbed him directly to death... and then flew away into the distance..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"..."Zhuo Yi heard this and took a breath of air.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Are today’s villains so hopeless?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There was no chance to appear as a monster. Just die like that?</p>
