  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1270 Death Heavenly Dao’s exclusive magic weapon</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A hook full of vicious energy came through the air. The huge pressure made people's hearts tremble.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The girl was shocked by the scene in front of her. She stood there and did not dare to move even half a step.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She saw herself lying in the medical cabin. She immediately had the answer in her heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So I'm already dead?" The girl couldn't believe what she saw.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But. How did she die?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong can't remember all this.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi immediately broke the girl's thoughts: "Sun Rong Junior sister, please calm down. My master will not let you die! This senior was specially invited by my master!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Senior Zhuo's...master?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong is even more confused.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi held his forehead. He was also carried away by the situation. He almost let it slip: "Well, my master was only willing to go out because of Mr. Sun's face. Other things Sun Rong school girl You will know later."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, these words finally dispelled the girl's suspicion.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"You two just hide behind me. Don't move! Leave the rest to me!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The situation was critical. Heavenly Dao stepped forward and directly grabbed the hook that was originally trying to lock the girl.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This hook is very accurate. If you are not present, Sun Rong's soul will 100% be pulled over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It seems that he is already an "old Thresh".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this point in time, the {Death Talisman} mass-produced in the Wang family's villa should have taken effect.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, it still takes time for it to take effect.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This onset of action is usually about 2 minutes.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And what Heavenly Dao has to do is to catch the thing that seduces Sun Rong's soul within these 2 minutes!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's obvious that Heavenly Dao didn't realize that this seducer was so tyrannical.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He had always thought that some Heavenly Dao Golden Men fished in troubled waters and concealed the incident.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But now it seems that the origin of this seducer may be unusual.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao stood firmly on the hook and pulled hard in his direction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The "Educator" obviously also realized that his hook fell into the hands of someone else and did not hit the target.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So the hook lock was recycled as soon as possible.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just like that, the two forces inside and outside the ward began to compete.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In this contest, 2 minutes passed quickly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The death talisman took effect. Sun Rong said "Hey".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Her body seemed to have generated a strong magnetic force, which directly sucked her soul in.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, the seducer outside the ward disappeared directly. Along with the chain that missed, it turned into golden powder on the spot...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What on earth is going on?"Zhuo Yi looked horrified.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"In short, I can be sure now... This is definitely not what our Heavenly Dao did... Now the quality of Heavenly Dao's little Golden Men is increasing year by year. Such a violent method of seducing people. It was not used a thousand years ago..." Death Heavenly Dao wiped his sweat. The unexpected encounter just now also surprised him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Fortunately, Heavenly Dao finally figured out what was going on.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "Sir, it's not what your Heavenly Dao calls this. It means..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao: "It can't be wrong! Those who were against me just now are the ancient Heavenly DaoGolden Men! They are the ancestors of our generation of Heavenly DaoGolden Men... Only the old Golden Men can have such powerful oppression. force."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Ancient Golden Men? Where did they come from?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The little Golden Men of Heavenly Dao are constantly reincarnated as time goes by. The reincarnation time of each Heavenly Dao is different."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"For example, I have only been reincarnated forty-six times. Among our six main figures, Heavenly Dao, the powerful Heavenly Dao has the most reincarnations. He has been reincarnated 262 times..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao said: "The Heavenly Dao after reincarnation will inherit the power of the previous Heavenly Dao's little Golden Men."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The last Heavenly Dao little Golden Men has essentially disappeared."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"So this ancient Heavenly DaoGolden Men can appear here. I also find it incredible."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi: "What now?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao: "The breakthrough has been found. As long as we can capture this ancient Golden Men, we will know the situation once we ask. But we have to capture him. We can only use the two-minute gap when the death talisman takes effect. I just made the first round I didn’t use all my strength. I was just testing his strength. In this second round, I will definitely be able to take him down!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi understood. Nodding slightly: "That's all we can do."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Right now, they have to wait for the next sudden sudden death of the girl before they can continue their action...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And in order to ensure that he can catch this ancient Heavenly DaoGolden Men in his next action.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao also sacrificed his own Heavenly Dao magic weapon: the Book of Immediate Death!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at the black-covered book. His pupils shrank: "This is..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"That's right! This is my exclusive Heavenly Dao weapon: the Book of Immediate Death!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Does it mean that as long as you write your name in a book, someone will die?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Haha. That was the most original version. It has been upgraded now! In addition to writing the name, as long as there is anything related to that person, such as hair, nails, or used items. Clip these things to In the book! The owner of the item will die immediately! And his soul will be absorbed into the book!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Death Heavenly Dao's plan is clear.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Later, as soon as the hook appears, he will open the "Book of Immediate Death" and put the hook into the book!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At that time, no matter what monsters and monsters are outside the door, his soul will be collected into the book!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Of course, an immediate death certificate will not work for everyone.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Heavenly Dao whitelist users. As well as the dead Heavenly Dao himself. They are all invalid objects.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After waiting for about half an hour, the sound of heavy chains was heard again outside the ward.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When the girl's soul heard the sound of the chains, she sat up in shock while dying of illness, and left her body again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, she still can't remember what happened before...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi Senior?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She looked surprised.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi had experienced this look half an hour ago.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi had no choice but to repeat what he had said before: "Sun Rong Junior sister, don't worry. I will explain to you later. This senior and I are here to save you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sun Rong looked at himself on the hospital bed with an unbelievable expression: "So, am I already dead?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Now. Zhuo Yi is found.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The scariest thing about people is not being a repeater during their lifetime.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But after death, it is still a repeater...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo YiIt is clear that now is not the time to explain the problem.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And even if I explain it clearly to the girl, if the girl returns to the physical body, this memory will still disappear.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Buzz!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Outside the ward, everything was as predicted by Death Heavenly Dao. The soul-locking hook came through the ward again!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Only this time. Death once again exceeded Heavenly Dao's expectations!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because this time the hook lock is not one!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But three in total!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These shameless people actually went to shake people!</p>
