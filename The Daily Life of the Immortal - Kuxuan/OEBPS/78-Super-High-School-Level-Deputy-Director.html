  <h1>Chapter 78 Super High School Level Deputy Director </h1>

  <div>

    <p>At last, Sun Yu was forcibly dragged away by the old butler.</p>

    <p>The butlers of Huaguo Water Curtain Group were not people to be trifled with, and this was true of Old Butler Lin, Lin San. He had watched these two young ladies grow up. Back then, Huaguo Water Curtain Group hadn't yet had the world-renowned success which it enjoyed in the cultivation world today.</p>

    <p>Lin San was already an old man in the group and had seen so much of the world; it was because of his years of experience that this old butler could still remain with Huaguo Water Curtain Group despite the fact that he wasn't very strong.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Lin! Let me go! Let me fight it out with these two brothers!"</p>

    <p>This was the last thing the girl said as Lin San dragged her away before she could let loose her lethal "Maiden's Adorable Fist" <sup>1</sup> skill.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Maiden's Adorable Fist" comes from a Chinese comedy sketch performed by an actor named Wensong, whose shifu is popular skit and sitcom actor Zhao Benshan.)</dfn>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. His Second Miss was still too young and naïve.</p>

    <p>Based on his years of experience, Old Butler Lin felt that there was definitely some terrible person living in this small villa in the outskirts.</p>

    <p>By the roadside, two baldies in aprons respectfully saw Lin San off in the grey commercial Chuanjianguo limousine and watched until it disappeared at the end of the road.</p>

    <p>"Did we go overboard? The Lord likes to keep a low profile. If they investigate him..."</p>

    <p>Before he finished speaking, the rubber man was interrupted. "Did you forget our Lord's Great Shielding Spell?"</p>

    <p>"That's right!" The rubber man suddenly remembered this fact.</p>

    <p>"It has nothing to do with us now... our Lord has more or less finished reviewing the materials. Now we can go help him with his homework."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It took Wang Ling a full half an hour to learn all the content for this week which he had missed out on. At the same time, he also looked at the next two months' worth of study material. He enjoyed the learning process very much, but he hated that it took him so little time to study; it wasn't difficult for him to master these knowledge points at all.</p>

    <p>However, while he could master all the relevant knowledge, he also needed to learn how to read the atmosphere in class, find the position that suited him the most and then try his best to attain average grades. Implementing the "be mediocre" education policy which Father and Mother Wang had instilled in him since he was young... this was the hardest thing to do!</p>

    <p>At his desk, he held his head in his hands and heaved a long sigh of relief. It was fine to leave the written work to the two gremlins, the monster pen and goblin eraser.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling had been reviewing his homework, Father Wang hadn't been idle. After a phone call with Lie Mengmeng, he quickly continued writing his novel.</p>

    <p>He was a very swift and decisive person, especially when he was in the throes of inspiration; the rhythm of his fingers on the keyboard was so fast that they flew, like a live tentacle monster.</p>

    <p>Just as he was brimming with inspiration and writing freely to his heart's content, his wristwatch suddenly rang.</p>

    <p>He frowned slightly — he really hated the feeling of being interrupted. But when he gave the caller ID on the wristwatch a look and realized that it was Lie Mengmeng, his mood changed and he picked up the call.</p>

    <p>"Hey Near Expert <sup>2</sup> , is there something wrong, I'm writing at the moment." Other authors liked to call Lie Shou "Lie Mengmeng," but Father Wang had a special nickname for him and preferred to call him "Near Expert."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The people in northeastern China call people who are good at something 'da shou zi' or 'da shou.')</dfn>

    <p>When Wang Ling lay back on his bed and took out his earplugs, the sounds nearby poured steadily back into his ears. Even before he opened his eyes, he happened to hear the conversation between Father Wang and Lie Mengmeng as the voices of the two men flowed into his mind.</p>

    <p>"Brother Situ... your book is going to knock them dead!!" On the other end of the line came Lie Mengmeng's loud, excited voice.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was certainly happy when he heard the news, but given his character, he would never be too obvious about it. "What use are lots of clicks, the way of the king is good sales."</p>

    <p>"Brother Situ, don't be so modest... tell me the truth, are you from the future?!" This question that Lie Mengmeng asked was very mysterious.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was stunned when he heard it. "Huh?!"</p>

    <p>"First, it was Let Go of that Wet Nurse , now your book The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King will probably also be a big hit and may once again break website records! I've read a few books before about plagiarists from the future coming back to the past! Don't tell me you're one of them?!" Lie Mengmeng said in astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Near Expert, if you make this kind of joke again... I'll quit writing!"</p>

    <p>"Don't, don't! I was just kidding!"</p>

    <p>Zhu Ge had already left; if Wang Situ was driven away, the website wouldn't be able to afford the loss.</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone call, Lie Mengmeng smiled secretively. "There's another piece of good news for you."</p>

    <p>"That's strange... our website investigated this ID and discovered that this VIP reader account actually had been inactive for a very long time. But at two or three o'clock this morning, someone suddenly logged into this account and changed the ID. We suspect that this account wasn't passed down in the family, but was bought through other channels."</p>

    <p>Father Wang frowned. Two or three o'clock in the morning? He remembered that at the time, he had been in Little Xuan's live stream gathering audience intelligence in order to come up with a theme for his new novel.</p>

    <p>Then... could this person have been some audience member from the live stream?</p>

    <p>Fuck! These days, even a web novelist had sasaeng fans <sup>3</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A "sasaeng" or "sasaeng fan" in South Korea refers to an overly obsessed fan, usually of a celebrity figure, who engages in stalking or other behavior that constitutes an invasion of privacy.)</dfn>

    <p>On the other side, Lie Mengmeng calmed down and said, "Brother Situ, do you know how much this reader gave you today? It's a whole hundred million cultivation reading coins!"</p>

    <p>"So much..." While writing the latter part of Let Go of that Wet Nurse all this time, Father Wang had never encountered such an extravagant reader before. A hundred million cultivation reading coins was a million HNY <sup>4</sup> . After splitting it with the website, he would be able to keep five hundred thousand HNY!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The author has introduced the currency of Huaxiu nation here as "Hua nation yuan," so we will be adopting it as HNY whenever it's mentioned from now on ..)</dfn>

    <p>Hearing that someone had gifted him with so much money, Father Wang sighed with deep feeling in his heart. "What's the reader ID?"</p>

    <p>"It's... Super High School Level Deputy Director," Lie Mengmeng replied.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Father Wang's face suddenly darkened and his intense gaze shot toward Wang Ling's room. "Hm... I think I've figured something out, I'll call you back later."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Father Wang ended the call on his wristwatch. "Wang Ling! Come here!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
