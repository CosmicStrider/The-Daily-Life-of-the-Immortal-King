  <h1>Chapter 52 An Official Counterfeit Is the Most Deadly </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>At the moment, however, the old uncle didn't have any evidence to disprove Wang Ming's claim that he was a cultivator. Today's society was a lawful one where evidence was required in all things. After many years in the criminal investigation department, this was naturally something that he understood.</p>

      <p>After ruminating for a moment, he stretched out his hand to Wang Ming. "Sir, lend me your ID card for a bit. If you are a guardian, our school has to verify your identity."</p>

      <p>Wang Ming didn't think much of it and straightaway took out his ID card from his pocket.</p>

      <p>With the ID card in hand, the old uncle turned back to the guard room to retrieve a portable card scanner and insert the ID card into it.</p>

      <p>In order to make sure that the spirit sword exchange meet between the two schools would proceed smoothly, Number 59 High School had been on alert these two days. This portable scanner was used to inspect suspicious characters; usually, it was only taken out during the college entrance examination.</p>

      <p>The ID card only needed to be inserted into it for the scanner to instantly verify what was true and what was false.</p>

      <p>This old uncle, who was a veteran criminal investigator, thought that if this person had really been dispatched by criminal elements, his ID card most likely wouldn't be genuine...</p>

      <p>It had to be said that the old uncle's deductive reasoning was truly spot-on... Wang Ming's ID card was indeed fake, but it had been made by Huaxiu nation's Cultivation Academy of Science...</p>

      <p>An official counterfeit was the most deadly of all...</p>

      <p>Wang Ming's identity had always been a state secret protected by Huaxiu nation. No one could get any real information on him. All the information on this fake ID card, for example, was basically all false except for his age. What place of birth, what ID card number, even the profile image had been filtered and touched up. This could be considered special treatment for the youngest academic in the history of Huaxiu nation.</p>

      <p>Forget this single old school guard, even if the cultivation police personally came to investigate him, he had no reason to be nervous.</p>

      <p>Finally, as Wang Ming had expected, the ID card passed the card scanner's inspection without a hitch.</p>

      <p>Like a POS machine issuing an invoice, the card scanner printed out a long list, startling the old school guard when he saw it.</p>

      <p>Name: Wang Xiaoer</p>

      <p>Gender: Male</p>

      <p>Age: 22</p>

      <p>Place of birth: Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace, Tianba city, Huaxiu nation</p>

      <p>Character Experience: Wang Xiaoer is from a poor family, but has unique talent and is a very rare existence on the whole of the cultivation continent. He has a little sister called Wang Xiaohua, though it's a pity they are not biological siblings. The places he frequents most commonly are auction houses and underground transaction venues. He is known to have a close female confidante who was born with an evil spirit inside her and isn't capable of taking care of herself. At the age of sixteen, he wasn't careful and lost his virginity to the legendary demoness Medusa...</p>

      <p>(The above information has been verified by the National Cultivation Police Department of Huaxiu nation.)</p><p>"..." This was such unrealistic character experience, it made the old uncle loudly shout "fuck you!" in his heart. This description was more fucking mysterious than the ones in online novels!</p>

      <p>However, the most inconceivable thing for the old uncle was that this weird and mystical description had actually been verified by the cultivation police. Surely some damn PY trade <sup>1</sup> must have happened behind the scenes!</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(There are a few meanings for PY trade, one of them referring to 'dirty' or illicit activities that don't see the light of day.)</dfn>

      <p>This unreliable biography had in fact been written by Wang Ming himself. Back then, the President of the Cultivation Academy of Science had repeatedly asked him to revise it... but in the end, he hadn't been able to win against Wang Ming's persistence.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming had always regretted the fact that he couldn't cultivate despite being a genius, so he took these sorts of details very seriously.</p>

      <p>He was not a cultivator, but he wanted to pretend to be one no matter what. He had to have whatever other cultivators had. The biography of the character on his ID card was based on summaries of cultivation novels which he had read. No matter how inconceivable it appeared, at least he was very satisfied with it.</p>

      <p>And as for the long sword weighing one hundred jin on his back, it was a real immortal sword. He had named the heavy sword Xuanzhong. Although he didn't have spirit energy to control it, he still braced himself to carry it with him wherever he went.</p>

      <p>To sum everything up in one sentence, Wang Ming tended to bite off more than he could chew and liked to go all out in acting pretentiously... this was also the reason why Wang Ling detested him.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming's idiocy was reflected in many aspects... it definitely wasn't just Wang Ling who felt this way.</p>

      <p>With his watertight ID card, Wang Ming entered Number 59 High School as planned. However, instead of looking for Wang Ling, he turned to enter the woods by the tree-lined path. Finding a corner with no one around, he put down the long sword he had been carrying.</p>

      <p>The instant the immortal sword touched the ground, it created a shallow grassy indentation in the lawn...</p>

      <p>Damn it, this sword was too heavy!</p>

      <p>His forehead was covered with sweat.</p>

      <p>An immortal sword weighing one hundred jin was like a toy in the hands of any Foundation Establishment cultivator. But Wang Ming was an ordinary person, and he had been carrying the sword for so long that he felt that he would dislocate his shoulder if he didn't take a break.</p>

      <p>"I should pass the Dao talisman to Wang Ling as soon as possible." Despite his posturing, he actually hadn't forgotten his current task.</p>

      <p>Coming here with the Dao talisman was his mission first and foremost; after all, it currently was the only way to rein in Wang Ling's strength. He had to pass it to Wang Ling before the present Dao talisman expired.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, it would be a crisis for all mankind...</p>

      <p>Thinking about this, Wang Ming decided to set out, but just as he was about to lift his Xuanzhong sword, he saw a pretty girl in the Number 59 High School uniform slowly walking toward him from afar.</p>

      <p>This was a tall girl, and even Number 59 High School's ugly uniform was unable to take away from her pretty face. From her slightly opened school uniform jacket, Wang Ming could even faintly see her sexy collarbone, and underneath it, those plump...</p>

      <p>Bloody hell! She was a black long straight <sup>2</sup> ! And also... a 36D! Excited, Wang Ming gasped and instantly lifted that one hundred-jin Xuanzhong sword off the ground like it was nothing and placed it on his back.</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Black long straight" is a literal translation of heichangzhi 黑长直 and is an online colloquial term to describe the particular image of an Asian beauty with long and straight black hair à la the style in anime, comics and games.)</dfn>

      <p>Obviously, the hormones that his adrenal glands were secreting like crazy had numbed his sensory nerves.</p>

      <p>Originally, he had had to squat a little in order to lift the sword and place it on his back; now, it didn't require the slightest bit of effort to pick it up with just one hand...</p>

      <p>"Hello, excuse me...can you do me a favor?" The maiden with long hair came over, her head lowered a little shyly. The sound of her voice was too beautiful, like the clear chime of windbells, and it made Wang Ming feel relaxed and happy in his heart.</p>

      <p>He had been confined to the research institute for really too long; this time, it hadn't been easy for him to take two days off to deliver the Dao talisman to Wang Ling. He had never imagined that luck in love would be waiting for him here... he looked at the maiden and his imagination instantly started to run wild. He couldn't even feel the weight of the Xuanzhong sword on his back anymore.</p>

      <p>"Of course... no problem! What can I help you with?" As a gentleman, Wang Ming felt that he really had no reason to refuse a beauty's request.</p>

      <p>"Well, when I was training in the gym, I accidentally thrust my sword into a rock, and I can't pull it out. Now my teacher's about to finish for the day. Can you help me?" As the girl spoke, she stretched out white and slender fingers to Wang Ming. "Let's get to know each other better, my name is Jiang Liuying."</p>
