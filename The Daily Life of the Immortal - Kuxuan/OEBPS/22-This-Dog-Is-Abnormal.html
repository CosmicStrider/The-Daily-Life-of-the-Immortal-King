  <h1>Chapter 22 This Dog Is Abnormal! </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>A dog?</p>

      <p>Furthermore, it was an akita with green fur.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian had recognized the breed of the dog in front of him almost at first glance. He found it strange, though, that an akita would actually have spiritual sense.</p>

      <p>Akitas were not on the list of typical spirit dogs.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian thus quickly deduced — this dog was definitely not a purebred! And it obviously wasn't a normal dog, since it had green fur!</p>

      <p>Staring at the dog in front of him, Xu Jian lightly brushed his bangs aside.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian, who was the third of the Three Young Masters of Burying Love, and number seventeen on the international list of killers, absolutely wouldn't be distracted because of a mongrel spirit dog.</p>

      <p>It was just a mongrel spirit dog. How strong could it be?</p>

      <p>If he just intimidated it a little, wouldn't he scare the shit out of it?</p>

      <p>Xu Jian thus slowly released his spiritual pressure.</p>

      <p>An invisible power fell from the sky to bombard Er Ha!</p>

      <p>However, things happened far out of Xu Jian's expectations.</p>

      <p>He was sure that under normal circumstances, his spiritual pressure was potent enough to crush pork into dried pork slices.</p>

      <p>However, it unexpectedly had no effect whatsoever on this dog.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, instead of being scared away, it unleashed its aura in a stand-off against him.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian responded very quickly. It wasn't a coincidence that this dog had appeared here, it was a watchdog that someone in the school had put here to guard the garden!</p>

      <p>They had actually arranged for such a mongrel spirit dog to guard the garden?</p>

      <p>Xu Jian felt that the whole of Shadow Stream was seriously being looked down upon.</p>

      <p>What kind of attitude did this mediocre high school have, in the face of a challenge from a world-class killer organization?</p>

      <p>Very well...</p>

      <p>Facing this unexpected dog, Xu Jian heaved a deep sigh. As a first-class Shadow Stream Red Ribbon killer, he would make this group of people who had underestimated Shadow Stream pay the price.</p>

      <p>There was nothing more to be said; in the next moment, a piercing cold light streaked through the air!</p>

      <p>— Yet another flying knife!</p>

      <p>To a regular person, this knife would be flying at lightning speed, but in Er Ha's eyes, it was very, very slow. Before becoming a dog, any fly it caught in the Gate Between Worlds had been far faster than this flying knife. Despite being a dog, it still kept the perfect, dynamic vision of a toad.</p>

      <p>This person wanted to kill it with a lousy knife? How childish!</p>

      <p>Er Ha only turned its head slightly, and the knife whistled over its fur to firmly embed itself into a stone pillar behind it. So tremendous was the power used that the knife was buried to the hilt.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian had never imagined that a mongrel spirit dog could have such a quick reaction. While he was feeling surprised, the dog suddenly became an afterimage, and like thunder on the plains, it swiftly and aggressively pounced on him! — It had been so fast that he hadn't been able to catch its movements!</p>

      <p>"— Go to hell!" He quickly pulled out a dagger and slashed at the flowing light which had rushed at him.</p>

      <p><em>Crack </em>! There was the ringing sound of something breaking.</p>

      <p>Then he realized that the dog had bitten down on the dagger and fucking broken it!</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the dog unrestrainedly chewed the fragments down to nothing right in front of him.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian couldn't help swearing. "...Fuck!" The dog's teeth seemed ten thousand times sharper than those of any assassin spirit dog specially trained by Shadow Stream. Were its fucking teeth made of titanium?</p>

      <p>In that moment, Xu Jian's face darkened as he faced a mongrel spirit dog that should have been very easy to deal with. He had carried out a lot of difficult missions before, but had never imagined that the biggest opponent that he would ever encounter in his life... would actually be a dog?</p>

      <p>Assessing its strength, Xu Jian was shocked again. "...This school actually has a mongrel watchdog at the late Golden Core stage?"</p>

      <p>The words were said very quietly, but Er Ha still heard it.</p>

      <p><em>...This guy doesn't just have bad spiritual perception , he's also a fool! I'm clearly a valiant, outstanding, charming and handsome dog that lives a pure and virtuous life and can't help spending the whole day enjoying the scenery of the little school garden! Actually challenging my bottom line over and over again?! — Fuck, is this punk simply tired of living?!</em></p>

      <p>"Qingliu! Come out!"</p>

      <p>Xu Jian shouted when he realized that this dog wouldn't be easy to deal with. Instantly, a brilliant light glowed in his hand as a scarlet spirit sword emerged, the image of a huge red hook imprinted on its blade.</p>

      <p>Er Ha had already been on earth for six years, so it recognized the brand of the immortal sword at a glance — it was a first-class spirit sword made by Nike, and could only be wielded by users at the Golden Core stage! And the "Qingliu" which Xu Jian had shouted was the name of the spirit in the sword.</p>

      <p>How powerful was a first-class spirit sword? It was powerful enough to destroy the body of a Golden Core expert! It could even puncture a person's golden core, and cause completely irreversible harm!</p>

      <p>If Er Ha had been in its original body, forget a spirit sword, even a more powerful immortal or holy weapon wouldn't be able to injure it. However, its current dog body was void of refinement; even a common kitchen knife could cut it apart, let alone a spirit sword.</p>

      <p>But...</p>

      <p>That was only if this lousy sword could come near enough to slash it.</p>

      <p>"Qingliu, go! Kill it!"</p>

      <p>At Xu Jian's cry, Er Ha immediately saw a spirit light emerge from the sword, and a faint figure was projected into the air.</p>

      <p>This appearance of a boy less than ten years old was the spirit of the Qingliu sword.</p>

      <p><em>Hum </em>! The little sword spirit raised his fingers and took a fighting stance. A bare second later, countless sword points shot out like a thousand arrows.</p>

      <p>Tremble, foolish dog!</p>

      <p>Kneel and surrender!</p>

      <p>It was as if Xu Jian had already seen this mongrel's gruesome death.</p>

      <p>It was just a mongrel dog with a bit of spirit energy, and it wanted to challenge his spirit sword at its level? Dream on!</p>

      <p>However, as a seasoned demon king, what manner of weapon hadn't Er Ha seen?</p>

      <p>In the end, it was just a petty spirit sword, and this assassin wanted to use it to fight Er Ha? He was really too young...</p>

      <p>Er Ha looked at the sword spirit, then looked up into the air at a forty-five degree angle.</p>

      <p>And then, ferociously...</p>

      <p><em>Woof </em>!</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Xu Jian thought the dog was about to demonstrate an ultimate move, but in the end, it only gave a clear and loud howl. He was completely confused.</p>

      <p>"What the heck is it doing?"</p>

      <p>To Xu Jian, there was nothing out of the ordinary about this howl, but to the ears of the sword spirit, it was a completely different matter.</p>

      <p>A weapon spirit's five senses were stronger than that of an ordinary cultivator. Even if it was just a subtle aura, it would be able to sense it.</p>

      <p>Mixed into that howl were traces of the demon king's power, and at last the sword spirit saw the true nature of the dog... behind it, he saw a giant shadow of a demon king!</p>

      <p>This colossal figure enveloped Qingliu, making him instantly break out in a cold sweat. He could clearly feel the tremendous pressure of a demon king!</p>

      <p>Fuck fighting! There was no way he could challenge it at all!</p>

      <p>Qingliu instantly waved at Xu Jian and smiled. "— See — ya!"</p>

      <p>Then, this sword spirit with no moral integrity retreated directly back into the sword, and the sword's light instantly faded. All this happened with less warning than Ultraman's color timer blinking red <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(When Ultraman starts to lose strength, the color timer on his chest starts to blink red in warning.)</dfn>

      <p>It was an embarrassing scene.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian: "..."</p>

      <p>Instinctively, Xu Jian knew — this dog was definitely abnormal!</p>

      <p>The whole time, Xu Jian felt that the dog had been staring at him as if he was some kind of prey!</p>

      <p>Pushing off with his feet, he flew backwards swiftly to put some distance between them.</p>

      <p>"Tch, you still want to run? Where can you run to?" Er Ha sneered, not planning to let this person go.</p>

      <p>Since the start of the fight, it had been gathering its strength. After a long delay, it finally felt the accumulated spirit strength in its body reach its saturation point, and a cyan light surged forth with a hum!</p>

      <p>"Not good!" Xu Jian could smell something dangerous in the air, but it was too late.</p>

      <p>In that moment, a great pressure suddenly fell from the sky, completely freezing him in place and making him immobile!</p>

      <p>Then.</p>

      <p>He saw a great shadow in the air, enveloping him completely and blocking out the bright sun in the little garden...</p>

      <p>He stared blankly at this indistinct huge shadow, and felt that it was somehow familiar.</p>

      <p>His memories started spinning rapidly...</p>

      <p>Suddenly, he remembered the powerful demon king which had emerged from the Gate Between Worlds in the sky six years ago, and which had the strength to swallow souls!</p>

      <p>This huge demon king shadow deftly stretched out its long tongue and ruthlessly swept up Xu Jian's soul.</p>

      <p>At the moment his soul was being swallowed, Xu Jian's heart was full of despair.</p>

      <p>Someone tell him... why the fuck had this demon king become a dog?!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</p>

      <p>Xu Jian died miserably, his soul a snack for Er Ha.</p>

      <p>The clouds dispersed, the shadow disappeared, and the sun shone brightly on the garden once more.</p>

      <p>Er Ha burped and found a good place in the sun to continue sleeping lazily on its stomach, as if nothing had happened.</p>

      <p>A rip-roaring wind blew through the little garden and ruffled its short, green fur...</p>
