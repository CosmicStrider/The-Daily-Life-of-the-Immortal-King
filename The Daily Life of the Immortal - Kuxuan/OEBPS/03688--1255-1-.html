  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1255: Under 1 spirit. Above all spirits</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi I believe that there are few magical weapons in the world that can ignore the sword energy. Let alone the sword energy emanating from Jingke.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The blow to his waist was really painful, but luckily it didn't directly hurt his vitals.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the sword energy of the Taomu Sword gently poured into the wound, repairing Zhuo Yi's injury.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The kidney is the key to a man. This messenger of destiny is vicious. But fortunately, he has the protection of Jingke's sword energy. Zhuo Yi feels that he will still have happiness in the second half of his life.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Buzz!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Jingke and Bai Qiao merged into one again, an astonishing sense of oppression swept over the place.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The young man in the snow-colored fur coat seems to have come from the Milky Way beyond the sky. His body is dotted with stars. He is clean without a trace of dust or dirt. He is as majestic as a king.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is... Lord Jingbai...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at the figure in front of him in surprise.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the young man's feet were off the ground, slightly suspended in the air, and he stared at the messenger of fate in front of him with a blank expression.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He snorted and said, "Such a waste deserves to see my king's lineup."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"I didn't expect that I would force you out after all."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was beyond Zhuo Yi's expectation. This messenger of destiny seemed to know Jingbai's identity.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the moment when he saw Jingbai appear, the pressure was obviously on the side of fate. But for some reason, Zhuo Yi felt that the messenger of fate seemed to be a little excited.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Boom!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, the aura of destiny suddenly increased!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There seemed to be a source of energy bursting out of his body like a volcano!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This is..."Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What surprised him was not the surge of aura. It was the Sword method behind the surge of aura!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If his judgment is correct.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">What fate cast was none other than General Yi’s famous skill {Wuji Sword}!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The true identity of the whole person. Is he a sword master?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Although he felt that this person looked familiar from the beginning, he still felt that this was not like the Juggernaut's behavior.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the Messenger of Destiny, who had activated the {Wuji Sword}, laughed wildly and forced his way up despite the pressure.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, he used the Sword of Destiny in his hand to predict the direction of his next attack.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Zhuo Yi! Next sword. I will pierce your heart directly! This is all destiny!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Next. Ben’s fate while moving at high speed.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His figure disappeared in front of Zhuo Yi again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is a sword technique that Zhuo Yi has never seen before.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Preview first. Then implement the content of the preview accurately.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Another extremely mysterious angle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The bamboo known as the Sword of Destiny was cut from an angle that made Zhuo Yi unexpected.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Just like the previous sword. Ignoring the defensive barrier of the sword energy, it aimed at the heart of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai shook his head. His speed was faster than fate.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The bamboo sword was less than a few millimeters away from Zhuo Yi's chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He took action directly, reaching the back of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Use an index finger to hold the bamboo sword against it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">There are only a handful of swords that can ignore one's own sword energy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai could only think of one sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This envoy kept calling his bamboo sword the "Sword of Destiny".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in fact, the real name of the sword spirit of this bamboo sword is: Pre.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Prophecy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Pre. The sword spirit was born in the same place as him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He even competed with him for the position of the Lord of Sword Spirits.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in the end, he won the throne with an overwhelming advantage.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even Shibai didn't expect that this second meeting would be here.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Preliminary. Is this the new master you have found?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai's face was expressionless. He ruthlessly criticized the messenger of destiny in front of him: "It's too bad!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the other side, after Destiny stabbed out the sword, he wanted to pull the bamboo sword away, but found that his sword was firmly attracted by a huge force.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The disparity in power makes it impossible for the Sword of Destiny to escape Jingbai's control.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Go away. This is fate.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Jingbai sneered.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He returned the previous lines of the Messenger of Destiny intact.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A ray of sword light shot out from the white fingertips. It was transmitted along the bamboo sword!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This sword light was only one billionth of the power of Jingbai.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But the speed is so fast and the strength is far beyond what fate imagined.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"not good!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, fate gritted its teeth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He realized he had to let go of the bamboo sword!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However it was too late.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sword light was transmitted so fast that it quickly poured into his right hand holding the sword like an electric shock.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The crushing sword intent poured in directly from the fingertips of Destiny's right hand. Along his fingers, everything was reduced to dust!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Destiny reacts quickly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He knew that he could not resist such a fierce sword intent.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The next moment, he gritted his teeth suddenly and pointed with the sword in his left hand to cut off his entire arm along his right shoulder!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">To prevent this sword intent from spreading to the rest of his body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It was only then that fate began to fear Jingbai.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sword spirit in front of me is too powerful!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At the same time, he was also deeply aware of it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He couldn't bear such a sword attack a second time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">As a swordsman, I lost my arm. This kind of pain is very painful for people to understand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Damn..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this moment, he was staring at the bamboo sword snatched away by Jingbai. His heart was filled with hatred!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This damn liar!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The sword spirit of the Sword of Destiny clearly told him that as long as he got him, he would win every battle!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was actually deceived by a sword spirit!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"The promise of victory in all battles...is all a lie!" At this time, fate roared in pain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Hearing this made Bai SiZhi laugh in shock.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He held the bamboo he had snatched from Destiny's hand. The expression on his face was also quite surprising: "Previously, you actually told him that you are victorious in all battles?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Obviously, even Jingbai thinks this is Chi Guoguo's fraud.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">During this period of life on earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai knows that there are phone scams and text message scams on the planet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This Sword Spirit scam...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This was actually the first time he had heard of it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The bamboo trembled slightly in Jingbai's hand, as if responding to Jingbai's question.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi felt that after this "Sword of Destiny" fell into Jingbai's hands.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is really very well-behaved.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It takes about a few seconds.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After learning the truth.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai raised his head and stared at the messenger of destiny in front of him who was dizzy with anger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"He didn't lie to you."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Jingbai said: "From the beginning, I have made it very clear. He is under one spirit and above all spirits. He is victorious in all battles."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">These words made Zhuo Yi suddenly realize.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I bet this messenger of destiny was so excited when he picked up this heaven-defying bamboo sword. He only heard the last four words "Ten thousand battles, ten thousand victories".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">If you listen to the whole sentence together, it is indeed not a scam...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Above all spirits...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">With this as the prerequisite, it can indeed be described as victorious in all battles.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But maybe even Zhujian himself wouldn't think of it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The new master he recognized.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He actually led him directly to find the only man he couldn't beat...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">All of this is indeed an arrangement of fate.</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Take off your mask. Destiny." At this time, Zhuo Yi looked at the man in front of him who was deeply involved in the "Sword Spirit Scam" tragedy and spoke.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He felt the true identity of the messenger of destiny.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Or "Juggernaut".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Or he is someone very close to the Sword Master.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Is it the evil god?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But this guy is still fighting the landlord in the cell...</p>
