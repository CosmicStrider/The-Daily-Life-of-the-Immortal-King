  <h1 class="calibre1" dir="auto" lang="en">Chapter 1253 Zhuo Yi’s right hand</h1>

  <div class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Number 60 High School On top of a tall building dozens of meters away from the battlefield.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The beautiful and dignified nun covered her veil and looked at the battle before her.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She was brought here 3 minutes after the chariot arrived.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">I wanted to go directly to Zhuo Yi to declare war. But I saw that the battle between the chariot and Zhuo Yi had already begun.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So Yue Yue decided to stay on the sidelines and watch. By the way, she wanted to collect information about Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, a young male voice sounded from behind the moon: "Mother Teresa, you are indeed the messenger of the moon."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Mother Teresa wanted to turn around, but was stopped by the voice.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Don't look back. I don't want others to know what I look like."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The young male voice said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Judging from the sexy and magnetic voice, this should be a pretty good-looking young man.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Teresa obeyed the order without turning her head.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She smiled slightly: "Let me guess. You are the star. Only you can figure out who I am."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Smart woman." The voice behind said.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, the messenger of the star position hides himself in the shadows.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was the third person to arrive.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After calculating the position of the moon, he took the initiative to come here and watch the battle ahead with the moon.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moon: "Chariot said. You estimate his winning rate to be 95%?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xingxing: "That's right."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Moon shook her head: "But I think his battle is not easy. Now he has even used his trump card. The half-void magic weapon formed by fusing the Void Spirit with the Sword Spirit. This is something that the Foundation is still in the experimental stage. ."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Someone has to practice it. I still think there will be no problem."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Xingxing's expression remained calm and composed: "Let's do this. I will deduce the winning rate for him again."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"How long will it take?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's quick. Just 2 minutes."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Abandoning his wife and son, he experimented on the sword spirit he had given birth to and who had absolute trust in him, even his own son.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After Chariot finished speaking his lines, Zhuo Yi already felt very angry.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He is trying to suppress his anger.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Don't let your emotions affect the battle in front of you.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">For a scum like Chariot, it would be too easy to kill him with one sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And Zhuo Yi is still thinking about how to save "Silver God".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Affected by the invasion of void creatures. Although Xue Qilin gained unparalleled power at this moment, this power also caused him to experience tremendous pain.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xue Qilin is now like a balloon that has reached its limit. There is a possibility of exploding and dying at any time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, the meaning of this silver god sword to Chariot may be just like the women he has played with.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's broken, it's broken. It's just a matter of replacing it.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Open the gate."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time. Zhuo Yi exhaled slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In the morning, he had already used the spiritual energy from 6 reservoirs to improve his level.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And now he's doing it again.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Improving the realm is also to improve the strength of one's physical body. To ensure that one's physical body will not be affected by the huge impact and collapse during the next offensive.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It turns out to be the Heavenly Dao technique." An excited smile appeared under Chariot's heavy helmet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi did not disappoint him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And now he also knows the reason why the sun died at the hands of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">However, this level of improvement is only temporary. The most taboo thing is to fight a delaying war.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">So when Chariot saw Zhuo Yi offering {Thirty-Three Little Paths of Vitality}, he also made his own plans in mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">That is to fight first. If the situation is not good, choose delaying tactics. Wait for the temporary improvement effect of Zhuo Yi to disappear before you counterattack.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it's a pity. Such wishful thinking.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi is not intended to be reserved for tanks at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time, Zhuo Yi unfolded his right hand. A brown spiritual light lit up from the mahogany sword in his right hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then it attached to his entire body bit by bit!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When Jingke's sword energy enveloped Zhuo Yi's body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The coat made of sword energy is like the iron scales of a battle armor. One piece after another appears on the coat of his suit. This sword...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Looking at this scene, Chariot couldn't help but sweat.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The peach wood sword that he looked down on before actually brought him a huge pressure at this time.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Chariot couldn't help but feel that the armor on his body began to become heavier.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It's not because the armor has become heavier. It's because his mental pressure has increased!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is like the stress response of a natural spirit animal encountering a natural enemy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The mind will become tense in an instant.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Then, breathing will become heavier.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Sweat began to leak out from the body surface.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Even. Incontinence...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">And Zhuo Yi was walking toward him step by step, carrying this mind-shaking mahogany sword. It was like a Da Luo Jin immortal falling from the sky.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">When he came to his senses, Zhuo Yi was already less than three meters in front of the chariot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Because of the fear in his soul, Chariot was surprised to find that he actually had a blank period in his mind... which made him fragmented!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is impossible!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was a majestic chariot. How could he die here!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The messenger from the star position had clearly calculated it for him!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His winning rate is as high as 95%!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Yin Shen! Hit them to death!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In panic, Chariot began to command Xue Qilin behind him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But what shocked Chariot was...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Xue Qilin just roared. He didn't follow his instructions.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo YiYou can tell just by thinking about how much Xue Qilin is struggling in his heart at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Its true will is obviously still fighting fiercely against the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In addition, Xue Qilin has already sensed that the "enemy" it faces...is the Lord of Sword Spirits!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">How could it, a little sword spirit, attack the master of the great sword spirit?</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The strong desire to survive caused Xue Qilin's mental state to fall into an even more collapsed situation. It began to struggle with the will of the mental space with the virtual spirits that invaded its body.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">roar!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">After the earth-shattering roar, Xue Qilin stepped out!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it’s not for Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Its front hooves pressed hard on the top of the chariot's head!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Damn...damn thing! I am your master! Aren't you afraid of the backlash of the contract?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Tuoyi Delei never dreamed that such a thing would happen.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He couldn't figure out why his sword spirit didn't listen to him.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He would never have imagined why the sword spirit of the Silver God Sword would turn against his master.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's your own fault."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">At this time. Zhuo Yi slightly raised the corners of his lips.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In front of the Sword Spirit Master, any identity of the Sword Master is invalid.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Those so-called sword spirit contracts are just a piece of waste paper!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"It's time for you to be relieved. Silver God."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi looked at the manic Xue Qilin. He lifted up Jingke and waved gently towards the void.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">In just a moment, the sword spirit contract between Silver God and Chariot was cut off directly.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The roaring stopped immediately. The whole world became quiet.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Lost the contract. Xue Qilin instantly turned into particles of light. It is no longer anyone's "slave".</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Instead, it returns to become the spirit of all things, waiting for a new master worthy of its wholehearted trust to appear.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This sword of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The contract became a waste of paper. He also destroyed the virtual spirit attached to Xue Qilin's body with one sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Kill the contract by force.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The astonishing counterattack force instantly returned to Chariot himself, causing him to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The condition of the chariot at this time was extremely tragic.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was trampled by Xue Qilin, and half of his body was sunk into the soil. Now his body has suffered internal injuries.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The outcome of the battle is already very clear.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi sneered. He looked at the miserable state of the chariot. He still didn't have any sympathy in his heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He slashed with sword energy.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">It only used the slightest bit of Jingke's power.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The indestructible sword energy completely disintegrated the armor of the chariot on the spot.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"This layer of armor is your shame. Now you, even your underwear has been torn off by me."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">Zhuo Yi stared at the frightened chariot on the ground. His words were calm and calm: "By the way, let me tell you, this sword of mine also cut off your spiritual roots."</p>

    <p class="calibre3">...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The whole process took less than 2 minutes in total. The battle was over.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">On the high building on the other side, the messenger from the star position exclaimed: "This is impossible! What the hell is this!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He was frightened by the huge variables in the deduction.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"What did you calculate..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The moon messenger was also surprised at this moment.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">She saw that Zhuo Yi only used two swords to resolve the battle.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The star messenger also spat out a mouthful of blood at this time: "I saw the peach wood sword in Zhuo Yi's hand... and the scabbard of this sword..."</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">He saw the previous scene of Zhuo Yi entering Number 60 High School holding Jingke in his left hand and Bai Qiao in his right hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">But it was just a peek.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">A flashback time!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">His whole spirit suffered a terrible backlash. One eye went blind!</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"Peach wood sword. And the scabbard? What on earth are you talking about?"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">"These two things have greatly reversed the situation. Increased the winning rate of Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">The star messenger couldn't believe the data he had calculated.</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">20000% winning rate...</p>

    <p class="calibre3" dir="auto" lang="en">This is like holding a father in my left hand and a mother in my right hand. There is a grass (a kind of plant) lying in my heart...</p>
