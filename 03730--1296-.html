  <h1>Chapter 1296 It was clearly arranged</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Eh? So you're going to die?" After hearing the monk's words, the Ajuan girl showed a surprised expression.</p>

    <p>"The fall of Dao God is different from the fall of ordinary cultivators." The monk said.</p>

    <p>After all, he has become Dao God.</p>

    <p>A person of this level will fall.</p>

    <p>You can also exchange your life by deducting your cultivation.</p>

    <p>But even if he doesn't die in the end.</p>

    <p>This time the attack of the six Dao Gods, no matter how you calculate it, will end with a loss of blood.</p>

    <p>Using the cultivation you have spent in seclusion for decades to pay for your own impulses doesn't really sound like what the Dao God should do.</p>

    <p>The monk was sighing and feeling regretful in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, it is God's Domain's superior cultivation resources that make these upper-level cultivators too arrogant.</p>

    <p>Even Dao God is not immune to vulgarity.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, these two people from the Wang family and the Gu family.</p>

    <p>That kind of state where the mind is like still water is the magnanimity that upper-level cultivators should have.</p>

    <p>Able to consistently rank among the top two</p>

    <p>This makes sense.</p>

    <p>"It's all fate."</p>

    <p>The monk looked at the picture projected on the screen and sighed secretly.</p>

    <p>The scripts of the Six Dao Gods have actually been clearly arranged.</p>

    <p>As a cultivator, if you are too impetuous, you are destined not to achieve much.</p>

    <p>Even if you are lucky and achieve great success for a while, if you fall, you will be shattered into pieces.</p>

    <p>At this time, Death Heavenly Dao has also arrived in the True Venerated Immortal Hall.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi holds the Golden Lotus of Buddha. Released from the core world by the death of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Hello brother!"</p>

    <p>"Hello, General Administration Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>Everyone inside the Office of Strategic Deception clasped their hands.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the scene in front of him. He scratched his head and said: "Senior Heavenly Dao, who just died, took me and Sun Rong to the God's Domain to watch. I thought the battle was over... I didn't expect it. It started again so soon."</p>

    <p>Although before leaving God's Realm. Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi heard about death Heavenly Dao's analysis of the ten major families in God's Realm.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect it to come true so quickly.</p>

    <p>"How is classmate Sun Rong doing?" At this time, Fang Xing asked, staring at the Buddha Golden Lotus in Zhuo Yi's hand.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Yixiao: "Let her speak for herself."</p>

    <p>Seeing Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan immortal all in the True Venerated Immortal hall. Sun Rong also had a very surprised expression on his face.</p>

    <p>On the way back to Earth, Zhuo Yi almost introduced the Office of Strategic Deception to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And he deliberately gave Sun Rong a pass, saying that there were several classmates she knew in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling excluded. There are multiple guesses for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She guessed Wang Zhen, she guessed Liu Qingyi, she guessed the Zhenyuan immortal who goes by the pseudonym "Zhen Yuan." She also guessed Gu Shunzhi...</p>

    <p>Because these are transfer students who are very good at studying.</p>

    <p>And as soon as he entered Number 60 High School, he seemed to be very close to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong never guessed that Fang Xing was actually with this group of people!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang Xing. It turns out you are too..."</p>

    <p>The girl was shocked.</p>

    <p>Now she finally understands.</p>

    <p>Why were Fang Xing and others accidentally eliminated in the Jiulong Mountain Physical Martial Arts Competition the night before the final battle!</p>

    <p>Because if these people participate, the others won't have to play at all!</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior..."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with Sun Rong school girl?"</p>

    <p>"I found out that Number 60 High School is full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. It's so scary!" Sun Rong felt very complicated.</p>

    <p>"I'm so sorry for hiding it from classmate Sun Rong for so long." Fang Xing said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"It's okay...I won't be surprised by anything I see now..." After these few days of experience, Sun Rong feels that his eyesight has been greatly improved.</p>

    <p>She feels that the world of cultivation is very small.</p>

    <p>Because it turns out there are so many dormant masters around her!</p>

    <p>She also felt that the world of cultivation was very big.</p>

    <p>It is as vast and boundless as the divine realm. It makes people yearn for it...</p>

    <p>"Are you taking notes?" At this time, Fang Xing noticed that Sun Rong was working hard to record things in the "small notebook."</p>

    <p>"Senior Death Heavenly Dao said. If I return to the physical body.</p>

    <p>Memories will be forgotten. That's why I have to write it down!" Sun Rong said with a smile: "I am currently sketching classmate Fang Xing! We will be good friends from now on!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing shrugged: "It doesn't matter if you want to be good sisters with me."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "???"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Return to the gate of Liucheng in God's Domain.</p>

    <p>It's beyond everyone's expectation.</p>

    <p>Faced with the aggressive questioning from the head of the Sheng family.</p>

    <p>The elder of the Liu family showed no fear at all.</p>

    <p>"Lord Dao God came to my Liu family's dungeon. We treated each other with courtesy. But Lord Dao God was aggressive. I wonder who is more shameless?"</p>

    <p>The elder of the Liu family smiled and said: "My family has always been in seclusion with no distractions. I don't think the six Dao God masters will make trouble because the Liu family didn't take action before, right?"</p>

    <p>After saying this, the expressions of the Six Dao Gods changed slightly on the spot.</p>

    <p>The elders of the Liu family actually knew the purpose of their trip...</p>

    <p>This is a little bit intriguing.</p>

    <p>It was as if he had anticipated this incident.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the Liu family knows everything. I think there is no need for everyone to pretend to be confused."</p>

    <p>At this time, the head of the Li family snorted and laughed: "The seven of us families are fighting for the divine domain. You, the Liu family, took the lead and stayed at home. In the end, we were defeated and returned."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family never mentioned anything about the Gu family and the Wang family. Instead, he threw the blame directly on the Liu family...</p>

    <p>Such rogue behavior really made the Liu family's elders feel a bit dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"If you want to accuse me, why bother?"</p>

    <p>The elder of the Liu family smiled bitterly and shook his head: "So, what do you gentlemen want to do?"</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. Since you are unwilling to contribute to the maintenance of God's Domain, then it is always necessary to contribute some money."</p>

    <p>The head of the Li family said: "The compensation for our family is 10 billion divine crystals. But if your Liu family can't get it out, then you have to weigh the consequences."</p>

    <p>"What are the consequences?"</p>

    <p>"You have to think about the citizens behind you and the many children of the Liu family."</p>

    <p>That's all.</p>

    <p>The elder of the Liu family's face darkened.</p>

    <p>Although I have long known that the tenth position in this family is not easy to achieve.</p>

    <p>However, he never expected that he would be openly bullied to this extent.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. I will make a bet with you Dao God. If I lose, the Liu family will do whatever you want." At this time, the elder of the Liu family said.</p>

    <p>"Oh? What bet?" The head of the Sheng family became interested.</p>

    <p>"You are all Dao Gods. You are bullying me, a little Dao Supreme. It would be a joke to say it out loud. In terms of combat power, I am willing to be defeated."</p>

    <p>The elder of the Liu family bowed and said: "In a moment, I will take the first step. With the land of God as the limit, you will take action again after 3 minutes. If you can find me, count me as a loser! Otherwise, all Dao God masters, please leave immediately."</p>

    <p>"Do you know the difference between Dao God and Dao Supreme?"</p>

    <p>The head of the Sheng family couldn't believe that the elder of the Liu family said something like this: "It's enough for me to find you by myself. If the six of us join forces, we can dig you out no matter where you go."</p>

    <p>"I think adults should not talk too much."</p>

    <p>"Then we'll see." In the void, the six Dao Gods all nodded.</p>

    <p>The vastness of the divine realm.</p>

    <p>3 minutes. Even if the Liu family is always in the realm of Supreme.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to rush to the Wang family or the Gu family to ask for help.</p>

    <p>They wanted to see what this wealthy elder of the Liu family wanted to do.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On Earth, everyone watching was also surprised.</p>

    <p>"Hey! Monk! What does this wealthy Liu family want to do? Can Dao Supreme escape the God of Thieves?" Miss Ajuan asked with her hands on her hips in confusion.</p>

    <p>"Well, of course you can't."</p>

    <p>The monk burst out laughing on the spot. He had already guessed the intention of the elder of the Liu family: "This rich man of the Liu family is always a smart man... He will be struck down by Ling Zhenren later. The aftermath will affect the people in the city. That's why he used this technique."</p>

    <p>"Wow! Then isn't this the legendary flash tomb relocation!"</p>

    <p>Ajuan girl shows her starry eyes!</p>

    <p>This TV series is so good!</p>

    <p>She can't wait!</p>
