  <h1>Chapter 1291 1 child</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the forbidden area, the head of the Zhou family spurted blood on the spot.</p>

    <p>He didn't have time to respond to what happened.</p>

    <p>The brain of Dao God that I condensed using the will of Dao God.</p>

    <p>A big hole was poked out in an instant!</p>

    <p>The backlash pain from the forcible decomposition of Dao God's brain was fed back to him.</p>

    <p>Just this one moment ruined his 100 lifetimes of hard work...</p>

    <p>The retreat is in vain.</p>

    <p>"Damn..."</p>

    <p>The head of the Zhou family stood up. His Dao God body bloomed with spiritual energy, and condensed spiritual mist to repair his injured body.</p>

    <p>Not for long.</p>

    <p>Boom! A sound!</p>

    <p>The aura of the head of the Zhou family has skyrocketed again!</p>

    <p>Some chaotic talismans crawled all over his body. They were very dense!</p>

    <p>At this crucial moment, the head of the Zhou family formed his own Dao God Seal!</p>

    <p>And cover the whole body with Dao God seal!</p>

    <p>"No one can challenge the supreme divine realm..."</p>

    <p>This seal of Dao God condensed his cultivation for 200 lifetimes. It is all his dignity!</p>

    <p>The powerful spiritual energy spread out, making the head of the Zhou family shine with light all over his body.</p>

    <p>The earth trembled deep in the forbidden area of the Zhou family. The head of the Zhou family no longer condensed the will of Dao God. Instead, he planned to break out of the position and take the field himself!</p>

    <p>However, just when he was about to leave.</p>

    <p>A figure shining with Buddha's light, bald head facing down, descended from the sky!</p>

    <p>The monk is here.</p>

    <p>He was like a golden meteorite that fell from the universe. He was not polite. He hit the head of the Zhou family head first and turned into a beam of fire and rushed towards the forbidden area of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>After a big explosion that shook the earth.</p>

    <p>The monk's smooth forehead hit the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>Two heads collided. The head of the Zhou family split open on the spot...</p>

    <p>Passed out directly.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the Dao God. First he suffered the backlash from Ling Zhenren, and then he received a headbutt from you, Monk. He didn't die!" Miss Ajuan followed the monk, like a little follower.</p>

    <p>She squatted next to the head of the Zhou family who was lying dead. She pinched the head of the Zhou family and said, "Wow! Dao God's face is so soft!"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "..."</p>

    <p>"So. Do you want a last hit?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Miss Ajuan took out her feather sword. The entire Zhou family's forbidden area was filled with golden angel feathers again.</p>

    <p>"No need."</p>

    <p>The monk shook his head: "I didn't intend to kill him in the first place."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan was shocked: "How ruthless are you?"</p>

    <p>Monk: "This is just the right amount of force. It can make him unconscious for a while without causing him to die."</p>

    <p>Miss Ajuan: "But I still don't understand. Monk, why did you hit him?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng shook his head and laughed: "I'm trying to save him, poor monk. If I don't knock him out, I'm looking for death if I rush out."</p>

    <p>Makes sense!</p>

    <p>Girl Ajuan suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, all the cultivators in the divine realm were stunned.</p>

    <p>"Which family leader joined the battle again?"</p>

    <p>The seven Dao Gods were alarmed by this extraterrestrial hand.</p>

    <p>Because they clearly felt that this extraterrestrial hand did not come directly from the divine realm...</p>

    <p>They gathered their Dao God will and groped through.</p>

    <p>Finally, I was surprised to find that this extraterrestrial hand actually came from the direction of the earth...</p>

    <p>"It actually stretched out from such a distance..."</p>

    <p>The remaining six Dao God were shocked.</p>

    <p>"Isn't that monk the number one person on earth?"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"Where did the owner of these hands escape from?"</p>

    <p>The conversation between the six Dao Gods made the monk who was currently in the forbidden area of the Zhou family smile.</p>

    <p>The most powerful person on earth?</p>

    <p>He never said that...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling disintegrated the Dao God brain of the head of the Zhou family with just his middle finger.</p>

    <p>This is something people never expected.</p>

    <p>In the sky, the remaining six Dao God brains have all condensed and formed.</p>

    <p>Even if one of the heads of the Zhou family is missing, the will of the six Dao Gods gathered together still burst out with shocking spiritual pressure!</p>

    <p>The heads of the six Dao Gods are like six rounds of divine sun. They hang high in the sky.</p>

    <p>"Won't this master on Earth reveal his true form?"</p>

    <p>A voice sounded again in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>The tone was calm, but it deafened the listeners. Soon, the virtual bodies of the six family heads appeared in the sky.</p>

    <p>This is a virtual image condensed by the will of Dao God. The specific face cannot be seen clearly, but it is connected to the souls of the six Dao Gods.</p>

    <p>They are waiting.</p>

    <p>At this time, the hand from the sky in front of me dispersed into large particles of light and scattered in the divine realm...</p>

    <p>When the light particles reunited, they formed the figure of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, the six Dao Ancestors didn't show their real bodies to others. Wang Ling didn't bother to send their real bodies.</p>

    <p>They also condensed their wills into virtual images to meet each other. This can be regarded as the greatest courtesy on my part.</p>

    <p>Although the virtual image of Wang Ling's will is also unclear.</p>

    <p>But the Six Dao God can feel it. This is the figure of a young man.</p>

    <p>"It's classmate Wang Ling!" Sun Rong also saw it.</p>

    <p>She did not see the front face of Wang Ling. She could only recognize the outline of Wang Ling from the back of the virtual image.</p>

    <p>First he appeared and destroyed a Dao God brain. Then he appeared as a virtual image and planned to fight the six gods alone...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is so powerful. It's beyond the girl's imagination.</p>

    <p>"Is classmate Wang Ling born to be so powerful..." Sun Rong stared at the scene of the confrontation with the immortal god in the air. The expression on her face could no longer be described as surprise.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren is so powerful that it can be described as more than just awesome." The scene in front of him made Heavenly Dao breathtaking.</p>

    <p>I can't help but recall those primitive days...</p>

    <p>I just feel that the figure of Wang Ling at this time is so familiar. Yet so strange.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next moment, all six virtual images of Dao God took action!</p>

    <p>Their bodies moved sideways. They were incredibly fast. They shrunk to an inch and traveled through space.</p>

    <p>One step forward and one step back is a thousand feet away.</p>

    <p>A silver bolt came from a tricky direction and locked onto the virtual body of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"He's caught." Accompanied by the shouts of the head of the family, the other five Dao Gods immediately surrounded and suppressed him from all directions. They collided with Wang Ling with their own bodies, showing full murderous intent.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Shadows collide. Heaven and earth shake.</p>

    <p>The mighty will of Dao God swept across the entire divine realm. The vast divine realm was instantly enveloped under the pressure of annihilation.</p>

    <p>The cultivators in the divine realm have been unable to bear it. Some have hid in the core world. Some have simply chosen to escape.</p>

    <p>"You actually used your virtual body to lay a trap..."</p>

    <p>In the sky, after the virtual bodies collided, they were suddenly shrouded in an invisible spiritual mist.</p>

    <p>With the cultivation of Heavenly Dao, it is impossible to break through the spiritual mist of Dao God.</p>

    <p>But the clues have already been seen.</p>

    <p>Dao God used his virtual body to lay a trap.</p>

    <p>They seemed to be desperately trying to crash into the virtual body of Wang Ling. In fact, this was a means of jointly sealing it.</p>

    <p>The virtual body carries part of their Dao God Seal power.</p>

    <p>Each person can condense a powerful sealing power by sacrificing several lifetimes of cultivation!</p>

    <p>After this virtual body trap collided with Wang Ling's virtual body, the power of the Dao God Seal was like a reptile. In an instant, Wang Ling's virtual image spread all over the body, and a bright divine light burst out!</p>

    <p>"Every rune gathered in the Dao God Seal weighs ten thousand trillions. This is the weight of God..." The six Dao Gods were secretly even more proud.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect it to be suppressed so easily.</p>

    <p>After all. This is God's weight.</p>

    <p>It's impossible for anyone to break free.</p>

    <p>But at the next moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling twisted his shoulders.</p>

    <p>He stamped his foot violently.</p>

    <p>Those Dao God seals bound to the virtual image were like divided fish scales. They disintegrated instantly! They were shattered to pieces!</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>The battle is over.</p>

    <p>In the sky, the brains of the six Dao Gods disappeared.</p>

    <p>The oppressive red clouds dispersed instantly. The sun emerged. It was cloudless!</p>

    <p>Bang bang bang bang bang...</p>

    <p>The six Dao Gods were all shocked to the point of vomiting blood in their respective family sanctuaries.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>However, this battle is not over yet...</p>

    <p>The next thing that greets the Six Dao Gods is the monk's head hammer falling from the sky!</p>

    <p>The monk has divided himself into six clones and targeted the six Dao God's family forbidden areas.</p>

    <p>I plan to have one child at a time.</p>

    <p>Completely block the possibility of these Dao God counterattacks.</p>
