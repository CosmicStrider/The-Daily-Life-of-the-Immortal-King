  <h1>Chapter 1306 Little Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>A basin of refreshing water was poured on Zhao Qingxian's body.</p>

    <p>He woke up from a coma and felt a huge pain in his head.</p>

    <p>The cold water seeped into his wound. The pain made Zhao Qingxian grin and scream.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian woke up and found that his hands were handcuffed.</p>

    <p>Facing him were two police officers responsible for interrogation.</p>

    <p>Something seems wrong...</p>

    <p>He remembered that after he boarded the teleportation array in God's Realm, he lost consciousness during the teleportation process... This may be the "motion sickness" phenomenon caused by the too-fast teleportation speed.</p>

    <p>But the question is. How did he get this injury?</p>

    <p>Why did I appear in this police station?</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian couldn't understand these things at all.</p>

    <p>"This is the earth, right..." Zhao Qingxian stared at the two police officers in front of him and asked with a serious face.</p>

    <p>The police officers were stunned. One of the police officers stared at Zhao Qingxian speechlessly: "Although you were beaten like an alien, there is no use pretending to be an alien here. Do you understand? Now we are We are establishing diplomatic relations with the Heavenly Dao planet. All aliens have information files. So, honestly explain the facts of your crime. Otherwise, you will suffer."</p>

    <p>"Crime facts..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian's mouth twitched. He wanted to cry but had no tears.</p>

    <p>He just came to earth. Why did he become a criminal suspect...</p>

    <p>"You are in big trouble!!!"</p>

    <p>The police officer looked at Zhao Qingxian very seriously: "You know, your behavior of beating yourself up like an alien and then hiding in the toilet and squatting to scare people is very shameful! Very and extremely shameful!"</p>

    <p>"What the hell?" Zhao Qingxian was confused.</p>

    <p>"Jiang Xiaoche, the secretary-general of Huaguo Shuilian Group, was so frightened by you that he is unconscious now! The situation is much more serious than you think!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian couldn't laugh or cry: "Officer... I understand the truth! But do you think anyone can be so boring? Beat yourself up like a pig's head to scare others..."</p>

    <p>"It's hard to say. Maybe there are really such boring people."</p>

    <p>The police officer chuckled: "We have already tested the scene. There is no trace of a third person. That's why we made this inference. And... we have reason to doubt your orientation!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "???"</p>

    <p>Police officer: "According to the statement provided by the security personnel at the scene, when they found you, your hand had already been inserted into Secretary Jiang's crotch!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "???"</p>

    <p>"So we basically restored the scene based on the facts."</p>

    <p>The police officer turned the pen in his hand and expressed his reasoning.</p>

    <p>"First, you have coveted Secretary Jiang for a long time. So you beat yourself into a pig's head and hid in the toilet to try to scare Secretary Jiang. After trying to scare Secretary Jiang unconscious, you carried out ill-intentioned actions against him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Second, Secretary Jiang was frightened and accidentally collided with your head, causing you to fall to the ground at the same time. Then the security personnel on the scene rushed into the toilet. They happened to encounter the dirty hand you extended..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the police officer was filled with indignation and slammed the table.</p>

    <p>He thought of the "Room N" incident that happened not long ago. The anger on his face was even more obvious!</p>

    <p>These Heaven-Slaying Swordsmen who can't restrain their desires should get out of here. They should all be severely punished by Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also felt sorry for Secretary Jiang, who had not recovered yet.</p>

    <p>When you go out, whether you are a girl or a boy, you must protect yourself!</p>

    <p>This good secretary-general is crazy even if he is crazy...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal Hall. With the second kidnapped Jiang Xiaoche being teleported here by Lord Ma, the entire package swap plan has been successfully implemented.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was in a coma when he was sent here. He was transported here in a very strange posture with his butt stuck out.</p>

    <p>"They do things neatly." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord smiled slightly and took the initiative to take a step forward and turned Jiang Xiaoche's face over.</p>

    <p>Later, it was discovered that the zipper of Jiang Xiaoche's pants was wide open and unknown liquid leaked out...</p>

    <p>This scene forced Crispy Noodles Dao Lord to quickly take back his hand. He was not prepared to touch Jiang Xiaoche again.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's "real alter ego" Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, he also has his own distinctive personality.</p>

    <p>For example: mysophobia.</p>

    <p>Take the matter of eating crispy noodles as an example. Wang Ling doesn't mind grabbing the crumbs in the bag with his bare hands. His fingers are covered with seasoning powder.</p>

    <p>But Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is different. He must wear gloves. Or use magic to guide the broken noodles inside into his mouth...</p>

    <p>If he directly grabbed it, he would not be able to accept it psychologically.</p>

    <p>"I'll do it." Immortal Zhenyuan saw this and took the initiative to step forward and help Crispy Noodles Dao Lord out of the siege.</p>

    <p>He saw Crispy Noodles Dao Lord condensing the moisture in the air to clean his hands. He couldn't help laughing and said: "Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's mysophobia is a bit powerful. Is it that exaggerated?"</p>

    <p>"This is not a matter of exaggeration or not."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord shook his head: "I feel like after I touched him, my whole body was unclean!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time. In the underground retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception. In the retreat room Number 328. Zhuo Yi, the Death Heavenly Dao and Sun Rong. are receiving shelter from the Office of Strategic Deception here.</p>

    <p>The underground retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception is designed for all disciples who need retreat. There are a total of 3,000 secret rooms.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche and Yi Zhiyang will also be sent to a separate secret room here for protection later.</p>

    <p>These two are like time bombs.</p>

    <p>One of them may awaken and become a son of the void at any time. Therefore, the task of monitoring these two people is indeed arduous and has a long way to go.</p>

    <p>However, there are two generals from the Office of Strategic Deception, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Zhenyuan Immortal, guarding this place. I believe that even if we encounter trouble, we can easily solve it.</p>

    <p>In secret room Number 328, Sun Rong looked at the feedback from the True Venerated Immortal Hall. He was slightly startled: "Zhuo Yi Senior. I didn't expect that Brother Jiang might be the Son of the Void..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Are you surprised?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head: "Actually, I'm even more surprised. Why is there someone in the hall who looks so similar to classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"You mean Crispy Noodles Dao Lord?"</p>

    <p>"Is this senior called Crispy Noodles Dao Lord?"</p>

    <p>The girl was stunned: "I'm just saying it's not classmate Wang Ling... classmate Wang Ling would never say so many words in a row in one chapter!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "That was the master's real clone. It was split from his body. You can understand it as the 'son' born to the master. That is, little Wang Ling? So of course it's like La!"</p>

    <p>LittleWang Ling...</p>

    <p>The girl seemed to have thought of something and blushed.</p>

    <p>"Then what is the real clone?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Ordinary clones usually dissipate immediately after receiving a heavy blow and do not have intelligence. Instead, they act according to the instructions of the main body. But the real clone is different. It not only has lasting combat capabilities. It also has self-awareness."Zhuo YiAnswered briefly.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, senior. I probably understand."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She looked at Crispy Noodles Dao Lord on the screen. She was slightly absent-minded.</p>

    <p>It's a wonderful feeling</p>
