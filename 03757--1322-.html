  <h1>Chapter 1322 The mysterious egg</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It's not a big deal to watch the excitement. It has always been one of the labels of people who eat melon.</p>

    <p>Comrade Zhuo Yi went deep into the enemy's camp, risked his life alone, and cared about his master's life events. Pretending to be stupid in secret was actually a test. The method was shocking.</p>

    <p>Of course. This road obviously still has a long way to go.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is not in a hurry. He has many plans in his mind, and most of them are plans that he wanted to realize but failed to realize when he was a student...</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, if you don't have a chance, then create one.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is waiting for the incident to end. Invite Sun Rong into the working group of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Then he can legitimately take his elementary school girl to do trouble in the name of work!</p>

    <p>Hey hey hey!</p>

    <p>At this point. There are 3 hours left before Tuesday, December 1st.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that in the Desert of Bones, Monk Jin Deng had almost finished the decoration.</p>

    <p>Everything is ready now. All we need is the east wind.</p>

    <p>The center of the dense installation. Wang Ling saw the monk's egg.</p>

    <p>The eggshell has regular purple patterns. It has a crystal texture all over its body. It exudes an aura of chaos.</p>

    <p>And the concentration is amazing.</p>

    <p>After fighting against the groundhog, Wang Ling also gained a deeper understanding of the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also understood how powerful the power of chaos is.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the layer of chaotic gray mist around him, the groundhog would have died a long time ago! He didn't need to use any serious palm skills to get rid of it easily.</p>

    <p>But if there is this layer of gray fog, Wang Ling's ordinary palm power really can't hurt the groundhog.</p>

    <p>So in theory, if you always use the ordinary palm method to slap the groundhog.</p>

    <p>Without considering the consumption of the power of chaos, the woodchuck should be able to survive infinite times...</p>

    <p>But it's a pity.</p>

    <p>There is no if.</p>

    <p>Because no one can receive so many slaps from Wang Ling in his lifetime.</p>

    <p>This monk's ten slaps is already the highest record.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it will be difficult for anyone to break through in the coming days.</p>

    <p>"The wait has finally come for today." The monk looked at the masterpiece he had decorated and was filled with emotion.</p>

    <p>It has not hatched successfully in 300 lives. Now it finally has a chance to break out of its shell while taking advantage of the Earth's Tribulation Transcendence!</p>

    <p>"Can't be sure what can be hatched?" Wang Ling also asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Ling Zhenren." The monk nodded. He looked at the chaos egg in front of him with squinted eyes: "It's impossible to guess what can be born from chaos before it officially breaks out of its shell. And this is it. The strangeness of the Chaos Egg. No one knows the final combination of the Chaos Sequence before it breaks out of its shell."</p>

    <p>The monk finished speaking. Wang Ling fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Because I have already seen what is in this chaotic egg...</p>

    <p>And this look caught the monk quickly: "Zhenren? Did you... see something?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said nothing. He just patted the monk on the shoulder. The expression on his face seemed somewhat meaningful.</p>

    <p>Secrets cannot be revealed.</p>

    <p>He uses the King's Eyes to peek into secrets. There are rules for that too.</p>

    <p>Although he already knows the answer, he will never tell the monk. Otherwise, it may change the law of cause and effect... leading to some unnecessary disasters.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk understands. Zhenren doesn't want to say anything. The poor monk doesn't ask any more questions."</p>

    <p>The monk is an open-minded person.</p>

    <p>When he saw Wang Ling's eyes flashing, he knew that it would be inconvenient to disclose this matter.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was filled with surprise.</p>

    <p>The power of Wang Ling's King's Eyes was beyond his imagination after all.</p>

    <p>After all, it is a divine object that is "not within the Tao!"</p>

    <p>Even the chaotic gene sequence can penetrate...</p>

    <p>It should be noted that before the Chaos Egg officially breaks out of its shell, there may be hundreds of trillions of combinations of Chaos Sequences.</p>

    <p>This is definitely not something that normal humans can calculate.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling. actually saw through it at a glance.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>The monk felt ashamed.</p>

    <p>He really wanted to know the result. But in fact, he didn't care that much about the result itself.</p>

    <p>No matter what is in this egg, the monk will accept it.</p>

    <p>After all, he has invested three hundred years of hard work in it...</p>

    <p>In itself, the monk felt that what he did was not very authentic when it came to using the Earth's Tribulation Transcendence to hatch eggs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't blame him. It already made him feel grateful.</p>

    <p>The monk just hopes that what pops out of the egg won't be too weird...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception. Retreat Cellar. Room 331.</p>

    <p>The girl in the Golden Lotus looked at the picture coming back from the screen and asked: "Zhuo Yi Senior. What is in the egg?"</p>

    <p>Because the original room 328 was damaged and is currently being repaired, Zhuo Yi had no choice but to move to a new room with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"It's hard to say. After all, senior Jin Deng spent 300 lifetimes without being able to hatch it." Zhuo Yi touched his chin and said, "Can senior Heavenly Dao know what's inside?"</p>

    <p>"Before this secret is officially broken, I'm afraid only Ling Zhenren knows about it."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao said: "This is like Schr√∂dinger's cat. What is inside the egg can only be known the moment it is born. For example, when Miss Sun gives birth to a child in the future, she will only know it the moment the child is born. Male is female. Otherwise everything would be possible."</p>

    <p>"Don't use me as an example!" Sun Rong protested online.</p>

    <p>"Ahem. Senior Heavenly Dao's words are right!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi cleared his throat and said: "But judging from the look in my master's eyes... I think it might be a treasure. I can clearly see that there is something in my master's eyes. A surprised look."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Surprised look? You mean classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has three questions: "But why? I only see the dead eyes of classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey! Sun Rong school girls are usually embarrassed to look directly into my master's eyes!" Zhuo Yi smirked.</p>

    <p>"Where...where is there..."</p>

    <p>The girl didn't expect that she would be exposed in one word.</p>

    <p>The face that had just calmed down started to get hot again.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong School girl! If you want to know about my master, you can start from me! My intelligence agent is free! Anyway, you are in the soul state now. When you return to the body, you will not be able to remember everything. You can ask me anything you want!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior Zhuo...I found out. You have become bad..."</p>

    <p>"It's not that I have become bad. It's the road to education. You should not be ashamed to ask questions. This is what I have always preached to the children as the General Administration of Hundreds of Schools. Don't be afraid when you encounter difficulties. You must ask the teacher! Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi finished speaking. Hehehehehehehe again: "You only see my master's dead fish eyes. This proves that you are still too young. You have to distinguish what kind of meaning is expressed in my master's eyes and express it." No matter what kind of feelings you have, you must start with the details."</p>

    <p>The girl did not reply. But in fact, she was secretly recording it in her "little notebook."</p>

    <p>"For example, when my master is surprised, his right eyebrow will twitch unconsciously."</p>

    <p>"For example, when my master is angry, his face will darken, his eyebrows on both sides will be lowered, and some hair on his head will float slightly."</p>

    <p>"Besides, it's when my master expresses his love..."</p>

    <p>"like?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Zhuo Yi said: "The only way to express love is to express love. I haven't been able to figure it out yet. For example, when Master eats his favorite crispy noodles, his face is always expressionless. Not even a micro-expression."</p>

    <p>"Eh. Is that so?" Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>She felt that she had learned a lot of useful information.</p>

    <p>"This emotional expression is very vague and difficult to define. It also requires the Sun Rong school girls to work hard on their own. Hehehe." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"I?"</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
