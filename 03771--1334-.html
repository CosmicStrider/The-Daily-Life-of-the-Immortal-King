  <h1>Chapter 1334 Is the earth going to explode again?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The power of the Lord of the Void flourishes...</p>

    <p>The huge pressure of the vast sea of stars has suffocated the entire earth.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord was injured. His body could no longer hold up under such tremendous pressure.</p>

    <p>The whole situation seems to have truly reached a point of collapse.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The golden light shield constructed by Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao shattered like glass.</p>

    <p>The two of them screamed, coughed up blood, and fell to their knees.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was above the void. She raised her hand gently and rolled up Heavenly Dao from the ground.</p>

    <p>The power of the void breaks through the gate of the core world and forcibly pulls the Buddha Golden Lotus out of the belly of the Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>This huge pain of forcibly breaking through the core world and snatching it caused Death Heavenly Dao to scream in agony.</p>

    <p>His face turned pale. It felt like his body was almost torn apart by Sun Ying'er...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's goal is only the Buddha's Golden Lotus. After getting the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>She waved her hand and threw Death Heavenly Dao casually into the distance.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao's body passed through several mountains one after another.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>For a moment, the mud flow collapsed, sending out earth-shattering vibrations.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. We can finally be together."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er held the Golden Lotus in her hand and looked at the girl inside.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a curious look appeared on his face: "Huh? You don't seem to be afraid at all? Are you ready to become one with me?"</p>

    <p>"You won't succeed." Sun Rong pursed her lips.</p>

    <p>"They actually trapped you in the Golden Lotus. That's too much! Rongrong, just wait. I will free you right now."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Sun Ying'er used a strong force and completely crushed the Golden Lotus with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>The girl's soul immediately turned into a stream of light and returned to her body.</p>

    <p>This is the first step towards returning to the void.</p>

    <p>Only by returning to the physical body can the inheritance ceremony of the Son of the Void be officially started.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Wang Ying finds a way to stop the split body, it is already too late...</p>

    <p>"I'm already angry. I hope you're ready to pay the price."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord tried his best to stand in front of the girl.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord was trembling all over.</p>

    <p>The blood gushing out from his injured right arm had wet his clothes.</p>

    <p>"Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Lord..."</p>

    <p>"Don't come here! Miss Sun! Just stand behind me. No one can get close to you!"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is at the front, firmly protecting the girl behind him.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect it. Can you still dance?"</p>

    <p>The expression on Sun Ying'er's face was still relaxed and proud: "It's just a trick. This is the final blow."</p>

    <p>The void energy in the universe has been gathered.</p>

    <p>Next. Just summon the Void Gate. Point the gate at Earth.</p>

    <p>With one ultimate void world-destroying cannon, the entire earth can be easily defeated!</p>

    <p>But now, she saw a clone trying to save this destined situation.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Ying'er feel funny from the bottom of his heart: "You are just a real clone. Even if you have part of that man's power, you cannot be my opponent. And that man is already trapped in an unspeakable place. I won't be able to come back anytime soon."</p>

    <p>While speaking, Sun Ying'er was also admiring Crispy Noodles Dao Lord's expression as he withstood her tremendous pressure.</p>

    <p>She knows.</p>

    <p>This man can hardly hold on any longer.</p>

    <p>This huge pressure from the Lord of the Void is acting on all cultivators on earth at the same time.</p>

    <p>Only Sun Rong is not affected at all.</p>

    <p>After her soul returned to her body, her body was already transforming into a child of the void. She was naturally immune to this pressure.</p>

    <p>"Don't hold on anymore. Kneel down." Sun Ying'er's iconic expression of a hidden knife in his smile became even more eye-catching after he became the Lord of the Void.</p>

    <p>She stretched out her finger and pressed it down through the air!</p>

    <p>I want to see Crispy Noodles Dao Lord surrender and kneel down in front of her.</p>

    <p>But at the next moment.</p>

    <p>An unexpected scene happened to Sun Ying'er...</p>

    <p>The knee was already extremely bent.</p>

    <p>The man who was about to fall to his knees straightened his back and stood up again as if ignoring the pressure.</p>

    <p>"Eh?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er frowned. Something seemed wrong about the situation.</p>

    <p>She couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>A clone that has been seriously injured. Why can it stand up again?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Is the earth... going to explode again?"</p>

    <p>In the dark core world of Sun Ying'er, Lord Diulei felt a strong energy fluctuation coming from the outside world.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that you know it.</p>

    <p>Something big happened on Earth!</p>

    <p>But what's worse is that he can't escape from this inner world at all. Sun Ying'er's ten clones are too difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>Although he has awakened Jingke and Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>With the strength of "Jingbai", he can naturally kill a child with one sword.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er's unlimited division gave Lord Diulei and Jingbai a headache at the same time.</p>

    <p>Why do they feel like they are playing unlimited Fruit Ninja!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, shocked and roaring in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Give up. The earth is about to be destroyed. Everything will turn into ashes." The ten split-body Sun Ying'er said in unison.</p>

    <p>They are proud of having succeeded in their goals.</p>

    <p>"Don't be happy too early."</p>

    <p>At this time, a familiar voice suddenly sounded from this core world.</p>

    <p>Just behind the ten Sun Ying'ers, ten split body Wang Ying suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>One by one, they held Sun Ying'er's head.</p>

    <p>"You..." The split body Sun Ying'er was shocked and turned pale.</p>

    <p>I don't understand how Wang Ying managed to appear in his core world.</p>

    <p>And what surprised Split Body Sun Ying'er even more was that Wang Ying also learned to split!</p>

    <p>"Goodbye." Ten Wang Ying's movements were uniform.</p>

    <p>There was almost no time left for Sun Ying'er to react.</p>

    <p>Bang bang bang bang bang bang...</p>

    <p>He showed no mercy at all. He crushed the heads of ten split-body Sun Ying'ers like watermelons.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei swallowed his saliva. He was surprised in his heart.</p>

    <p>He thought this might be the legendary domestic violence scene...</p>

    <p>To Lord Diulei's surprise, Sun Ying'er, who had ten divisions, did not continue to complete the division.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei himself also quickly returned to reality from the disappearing dark core world with ten splinter bodies Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"How did Lord Wang Ying do it?" Lord Diulei was curious.</p>

    <p>"Of course you have to use some special methods when dealing with a woman who plays with fire."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying raised the corners of her lips slightly: "I copied her Shadow ability. Naturally, I learned to split. As for the ability to prevent splitting, Ah Nuan gave it to me."</p>

    <p>"Did Nuan Zhenren take action again?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. She's just a nosy girl. She just can't take any time off in this belly every day."</p>

    <p>Split body Wang Ying smiled and said: "I have also sent people to other battlefields. They can effectively prevent Sun Ying'er from splitting. Except... one place..."</p>

    <p>"Where?"</p>

    <p>"Heh. A place where you can win without showing up."</p>
